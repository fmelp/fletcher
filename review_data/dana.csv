Review,prediction"I had no intention of day drinking on Saturday, March 10. ""The Erin Express is stupid,"" I told Zack H and friends. We're not in college anymore. And it's not even St. Patrick's Day. By 4:30pm, I was in University City and my caloric consumption for the day had added up to 1 piece of toast, 2 egg whites and 4 Coors Lights. I was getting a little lightheaded watching the Drexel dance team grind up on each other at the Blockley and I needed to eat. To Bobby's Burger Palace we went. It's hard to find a turkey burger (or black bean burger, for that matter) that isn't ""southwestern"" themed. You can keep your chipotle mayo and your mango salsa, thanks. I was overjoyed that I could pick from nearly a dozen different themed burgers and ANY of them could be made with ground turkey (or chicken!). Not sure why there isn't a veggie burger option. Bobby, get on it. I chose the L.A. Burger, which came topped with watercress, avocado, cheddar cheese and tomato. Can you say perfection? Juicy, flavorful meat with a great patty:bun ratio. The bun held onto the toppings with strength and diligence. The sweet potato fries were pretty good, but I think I'd choose regular next time (even though they are the same price). The ordering system was easy. Order your burger up front and they bring it to you. I had a grand time imagining an angry Bobby Flay (https://twitter.com/#!/a…) in the kitchen while I waited for my meal. Not sure why people are complaining about prices. Two burgers, an order of fries and two beers came to $25. We came, we ate, we conquered. Then we moved to the next bar.",1"BBP is very hit or miss. Sometimes I will walk in, and get a great burger (my burger of choice is the Santa Fe-try it with the jalapeno sauce on the table) and fries...other times, there's a large line, my burger is either rare or overdone, and my friend and I can barely get a table. The main benefit to me is that they're open relatively late and in a central location for meeting up with friends or going to class-NOT the food itself, unfortunately. The shakes are not good here-I've had them two different times and they were one step above being straight milk and expensive. Regular fries are also not good-the sweet potato are fine if you have a craving but I wouldn't go out of my way.",1"Disclaimer: I'm reviewing Bobby's Burger Palace as a vegetarian. I came to this BBP late on a Sunday night with some friends on a whim. I used to be a big follower of Food Network, so I was excited to try a Bobby Flay restaurant, though I knew my options were limited as a vegetarian. The interior is really cool--a bright, colorful interior, striped bar-like tables, and nice shots of burger food paintings on the walls. The line was short, and it wasn't too crowded since it was a Sunday night, so we only waited about 5 minutes to order. I got a Griddled Cheese--which is basically a bunch of different cheeses and tomato between white bread--and Sweet Potato Fries, which came with Honey Mustard Horseradish Sauce. My friend who was eating ordered a Palace Classic Burger. We sat at our table, and the food came out about 15 minutes later. I was very underwhelmed by the cheese sandwich I really could have made at home, yet paid almost $6 for. It was boring, bland, and randomly oily. The sweet potato fries were a bit better, but not outstanding by any means, and the honey mustard/horseradish sauce was watery and sad. The only thing I really liked food-wise were the variety of sauces at the table, ranging from Chipotle Ketchup to Jalapeno Sauce to Burger Sauce, which were all actually really interesting and made the food substantially more tolerable. Maybe the cool burgers are better, but my friend said he was just content with the one he got--he said we might as well have just gone to the nearby McDonald's to get a burger instead of wasting money here. Overall, at least from my experience, don't go to BBP if you're a vegetarian unless you feel like blowing a ridiculous amount of money on a basic cheese sandwich. Hopefully the celebrity chef restaurants I go to in the future are more up to standards.",1"Solid burger joint on Penn's campus. The burgers are a bit more gourmet and come with a higher price tag than McDonald's down the block. I've been to another BBP around my hometown, and I'll have to say that compared to my local BBP, this BBP in Philly is really a hit or miss. Service is on par, but the food is sometimes overcooked, which makes it inconsistent. Food wise, I recommend the LA Burger or the Miami Burger and make sure you crunchify it. They'll add potato chips into your burger. Since burgers don't come with fries, then you can take out the potato chips later and they'll serve as your unhealthy side of oil-infused potato. If you really want fries, sweet potato is the way to go. However, as I mentioned, this place is inconsistent, so sometimes you'll have perfectly done sweet potato fries and sometimes they'll be fried to a crisp--and not in a pleasant way. Drink wise, I think the milkshakes are quite good but definitely overpriced. The spiked milkshakes are also quite delightful with my personal favorite being the Mocha Kahlua Vodka.",1"In my experience, the food here is decent.  Truly, it's adequate.  I've never had anything that rocked my world, but I will say that this month's burger (a nacho burger of some sort) was good.  The fries aren't that special, but they're certainly better than McDonald's down the block (obviously). However, last night I was there with a group of about 8 other people during the Saturday dinner rush (7:15 PM).  Milkshakes were ordered and delivered in a reasonable timeframe as expected, and we began waiting on our food.  Since we ordered our burgers to go, we stood in the middle of the restaurant and watched others who had arrived later than us getting served.  The second time we asked where our food was (a little before 8 PM), someone apologetically informed us that they had forgotten about our order because they were busy.  To their credit, they said they had then placed our orders at the very front of the line to get us taken care of ASAP.  One member of our party got free fries she hadn't ordered, but otherwise there was no real attempt to compensate us for our wait. I'll admit that last night's incident was likely an aberration and not the norm, but still.  The food and the prices are better at Copabanana at 40th and Spruce, and that's why I won't be coming back to BBP by choice.",1"-The people who work here are friendly and have good customer service skills. Burgers come out quick, even when it is busy. They do a good job following your cooking specifications. Margaritas are WEAK. Don't order one. Dallas Burger: Eh, I was hoping to get wow'd on this one, which didn't happen. They must have given me a regular burger, cause mine definitely was not ""spice crusted."" What was even worse was the sad, soggy coleslaw that sat atop the beef. Wilting crapiness and all, it looked and tasted like it was sitting in a pre-prepped bin for the past week before making it to my burger. Miami Burger: Ah, like the one, very rare occasion on which Bobby Flay succeeds and does not exhibit a lackluster performance on Throwdown, this burger was a winner. I'm a big fan of anything Cuban, especially women and sandwiches. The ham, swiss, and pickles were portioned out well, the burger was cooked perfectly - definitely the best selection at BBB. Palace Classic Burger: Classically average. Not much else to say about this one. Sweet Potato Fries: These are worth ordering. They are cooked just right, crunchy, not greasy but also not dry, and the honey mustard horseradish sauce is a nice change from the usual ketchup.",1"I like this place. The thing is, don't let the celebrity chef thing lure you in. This is what to expect: a burger that's better than your average fast food burger, but not a high end restaurant burger. It's right in the middle. It's also perfectly situated in the heart of University City. Honestly, it's a really good place for a student to grub. - The Dallas Burger - This is what I end up getting most of the time. I fall for the BBQ sauce and the spice crusted patty. The thing is, it can easily be overseasoned, and even when I ask for less salt, I'm usually really thirsty by the end of the meal. - The LA Burger - The avocado in it makes the burger. It's a little cleaner and will leave you feeling a little better than the Dallas Burger. I usually also shell out for the french fries. I like that on the tables there's a little rack of different sauces to use with the burgers and fries. I personally like the green one. A decent place for a fairly quick bite.",1I just had lunch at Bobby's Burger Palace and wow I have to say that I am highly impressed. While I expected overpriced oddities I found some of the most delicious burgers I have ever tasted at a great proce. The meat is seriously moist and juicy and the other ingredients used are fresh and delicious. It takes burgers to the next lever. The atmosphere is great and the service staff were awesome and fun to talk to. If you are looking for a great burger in a relaxing atmosphere then this place is a definite must!,0had the Buffalo Style; it was just about what you'd expect from a quality burger place. The prices were decent for what you received. Definitely stop by next time you're in University City!,0"I've gone to Bobby's Burger Place quite a few times, and I have nothing but positive experiences with them. Service is great, the food is great, and the atmosphere is great. The locations are very convenient for me and they even have online ordering now! Hop online, set the time, set the location, place your order and boom! Food is ready when you get there! What more could you really ask for? All at pretty great prices, at that. To be to the point though, here's the breakdown: /  / 1) The food itself is great. I've never had any problems, and I'm sure any issues would be handled well by the staff and cooks. / 2) The locations are always clean. Nothing dirty, nothing gross. Always spotless and that's a huge plus. / 3) Prices are fair and definitely worth it. Not too much, not too little where you'd question the quality. Just right. /  / I strongly recommend coming to Bobby's; it'll be worth your time!",0"I recently went to Bobby's Burger Palace.  I had heard pretty good things, so I went in with pretty high expectations.  I ordered the classic palace burger, as I wanted to try the original, with a side of sweet potato fries and some lemonade.  The staff was unfriendly right off the bat and seemed to be trying to rush us through the line even though we were the only people in line, and looked annoyed when I asked for extra onions on my burger.  It took around 15 minutes for them to bring our food.  My burger was falling apart before I picked it off the plate and was completely bland and unseasoned.  My sweet potato fries were mushy and stringy.  All of this and it still costs 13 dollars for a basic meal.  I can definitely say I will not be returning and warn anyone else from trying this place.",0"I want a crunchburger from Bobby's right now! I am so lucky this place is right around the corner from my apartment. When I go I usually get sweet potato fries and onion rings with my burger because I can never decide. They have amazing spiked milk shakes; vanilla caramel bourbon is my favorite. When I go with friends we take advantage of their awesome beer selection which would please most people. Now back to the burgers, the crunchburger is great but the Napa valley and LA burgers are a must try to. Basically you will be very full when you leave no matter what you choose.",0"We wont be returning to Bobby's Burger Palace anytime in the future. Everything that could have possibly went wrong, went wrong. When we got to Bobby's Burger Palace we were  greeted by a rude service person who seated us. Then our waitress was  non existent. She came to the table to take our order and never asks us about a beverage or an appetizer. We had to wait until the food was done in order to get something to drink. My burger was fine but my girlfriend's burger was pretty much mooing. She asked for well done and the burger was red all inside. ",0"We chose this hotel as we were travelling with three 12 year old boys.We had a villa with a huge (17m) pool, both were absolutely stunning and without fault.The whole hotel is beautiful, spotlessly clean and well laid out.The spa was lovely and the treatments were very good.The staff are mostly efficient and professional.We were extremely disappointed with the half board options (over sold by the agent). The food on offer was ok but not acceptable for half board- room service was the best option, which of course we had to pay for!But even more disappointing was being turned away from breakfast as the restaurant was full (along with about 10 other people)! Now I accept we were travelling at the height of the season but we have never experienced this before, anywhere. The staff were too few and simply could not cope. Totally unacceptable.The kids club (which caters for up to 12 year olds) was also very disappointing - great if you have 4 to 8 year olds who like swimming.The last straw for me was paying the bill, charged for all sorts of things we didn't have or take part in (650 euro's) and standing in reception querying every item - very poor.The hotel could offer a wonderful holiday but they have a lot to learn...",1"Borgo Egnazia is the place to getaway and appreciate the leisure side of life. A place to sit back and relax. There are no theme parks, no gimmicks. The facilities are all there for a vacation. Nothing is intrusive. It is also perfectly located and surrounded by some amazing neighboring cities (Alberobello, Lecce, and Polignano a Mare just to name a few).",1We loved the hotel. Beautiful accommodation. A point to make - if you book a Borgo room on a halfboard basis you are far more restricted as to the restaurants you can eat it in. We would go _back but we would book in La Corte section of the hotel on bed and breakfast and have complete freedom of choice of restaurants in hotel. The cost overall is pretty much the same. Great pools_which were never crowded.,1"If you are traveling with children but still want a true luxury holiday: don't look any further! You simply must try Borgo Egnazia!_I just can't say anything bad about it: rooms, staff, swimming pool, restaurant, grounds: all where just perfect. I especially want to mention the children's club were our son Jean-Baptiste was pampered like a prince by Charmaine, Trudy and Rosita. As a parent, this really makes the difference. Also Antonia from the reservation office was very helpful. We were planning on returning this year, unfortunately circumstances don't allow this but next summer: we'll definitely be back!",1"We have just returned from a great holiday in Borgo Villas. As a family with 3 children aged 5, 12 and 15 we struggle to find accommodation and facilities suitable for all. We stayed in one of the beautiful 3 bedroom villas with our own pool. The pool at the Borgo village had a fantastic children's section for our youngest but also had a great large pool for the older two along with an area with table tennis, Wii and xbox when the teenagers fancied something else. The food was stunning and any special requests were always served without hesitation. We visited both beaches and although the further of the 2 (5 min shuttle) had little in the way of facilities, they were building a small snack bar which should be up and running very soon.The staff were always very polite and courteous. We will definitely be returning.",1"A wonderful experience - Borgo Egnazia has captured all the best elements of a design hotel but without being too stuffy and unwelcoming. The staff are friendly and helpful, the rooms are beautiful and the food is of a good standard. The dining choices were limited the week that we stayed as it was only the start of the season, however there are some great restaurants with amazing raw seafood in Savelletri - the pretty fishing village 1km away. The only single disappointment was the fact that some rather selfish parents insisted on bringing their children to the adult pool, despite the fact there is a dedicated children's swimming pool (and kid's club), so rather than having a peaceful day by the pool, it often felt more like a Mark Warner holiday!",1"We spent 10 days here with our 2 year old daughter . We opted for one of the townhouses which despite some of the negative reviews actually suited our purposes very well with a separate small bedroom for the cot on the ground floor. As previous reviewers have noted it was indeed dark although this seemed in my mind to be in keeping with the desire to maintain a cooler environment away from the high temperatures outside. Overall the accomodation was very well appointed although I can see why some people may be disappointed with certain aspects for example the kitchen which is really just a gesture, pretty much pointless actually, and although I would have no desire to come to a resort like this on a self catering basis either make it functional or dont have it . What this accomodation really gives you is a good sized bedroom and small but separate living space along with a private outside area wrapped up in an asthetically pleasing package as a 'townhouse' as part of the Borgo ..... overall I think it works very well.__Looking at the resort as a whole Its hard not to be impressed with the design, quality of the fit and the detail which add up to a really stunning look. There are lots of comfortable seating areas particularly around the hotel and in the outside bar area. There are three pool areas ( one at the Borgo is family pool) which were very comfortable and two beach clubs (one sand, one rock) so plenty of options for relaxing in the sun. The rocky beach was a 10 minute ride from the hotel by golf buggy and provided a more spacious environment and better facilities than the sandy beach which was also a 10 minute drive but by minibus. We used the spa on a few occasions and found the treatments there to be very good and service by the staff was very friendly and efficient__In terms of the food we came away with very mixed feelings primarily because although the food itself was consistently of a high standard the service away from the main restaurant in the hotel was very poor and at times rude. The staff at the Borgo restaurant for breakfast were brusque and rude on several occasions as well as appearing offended by the behaviour of our two year old who was doing nothing to warrant that attention. Pretty much the same story in the evening at that restaurant, they have a buffet and a fixed price menu. We opted for the fixed price menu however when asked the waiter failed to explain that it was indeed a fixed price format hence my partner only had one out of a possible four courses and then we waited an infuriating 20 minutes for the bill. We complained to reception the next day but after confirming they would look into the matter we heard nothing more. Infact, on no less than 6 occasions over the 10 days we spent there it took staff 15 minutes or more to bring us the bill ..... completely unacceptable for a hotel of this standard. It did seem that certain members of the waiting staff who could not speak good english would go out of their way to avoid helping us and sometimes this gave us the sense (probabably incorrectly) of preferential treatment for the natives. Interestingly, the price of the various buffets and fixed price menus were not automatically given by staff before the meal and there was nothing indicating pricing anywhere else something I found quite strange ........ The food itself was generally very good with high quality ingredients used particulary in the main hotel restaurant although overall could benefit from more frequent rotation of choices.__This is up there with the best luxury hotels in Europe, however the service and attitude of some of the members of staff particularly in the restaurants really lets it down which is unfortunate as it slightly tainted an otherwise great vacation.",1"I enjoyed everything in Borgo such as the beach, tennis and villas... but my favourite of all was the teen club, I had great fun there and there was lots to do! Thanks allot to everyone in the teen club for making me have an absolutely fabulous time!",1"When one is told that a Hotel is new, and recently opened you might expect some problems. Problems such as inexperience, inefficiency, inability to cope and maybe at worst some sign of the recent workmens activities._But at Borgo Egnazia, despite having only opened in July, you would have thought the place had been ticking over for ever._Let me start with the one problem, it was difficult to find, but here I blame the agents directions. If they had said take the main road south from Bari ( the nearesty airport) and then get off at Fasano and make for Savelleri it would have saved us a lot of time._As a result of occluded directions however we arrived near mid-night._This did not prevent an outstanding reception and the rustling up of a delicious meal._The rooms are the highest tech I have ever come cross, including a sensor which seems detect that you need to go to the loo during the night and switches on an illuminated guided path. All other electronics, including reading lights.. something very iimportant to a mature traveller, and splendid entertainment facilities including free dvds and wif fi were great. The food was fresh and presented with panache, maybe this had something to do with the fact that exept for a fashion film crew wewere the only guests.. well it was mid November after all._All the staff were as happy, willing, and welcoming as the reception people had been.__We had a choice of three pools to sit by, and the Hotel overlooks olive groves and a great little golf course, oh and of course the Adriatic in the background. __This hotel is the newest of a small elegant but highly experienced little group._What more can one want ?",1"We stayed here for 9 nights in July 2012 for a family holiday. The hotel is lovely and clean and the facilities for children are very good. There is however something missing that we can't quite put our finger on.__We had a Deluxe room and this was spacious enough for 2 adults and our 10 year old boy. The only problem was that 2 days running maintenance staff decided to start drilling at 6am and 8am respectively somewhere in the hotel whcih echoed throughout. We mentioned this on the first occasion, but it still occurred a second day which in a 5 star hotel we found unacceptable. __The hotel has 3 restaurants and one bar restaurant as well as 2 poolside restaurants. The service here is a bit hit and miss, but generally the staff try to accommodate most requests. It was obvious that there was a lot of new staff and this may account for them being unsure as to what was on the menu and what you ordered. We love Italian food, however the food served left us a little underwhelmed. There was not a great deal of variety and the authentic Italian cooking we have loved in Sardinia, La Maddalena and Milan was somewhat lacking here. __The location is ok, the surrounding area's are quite industrial, but none of that is noticed whilst you are in the hotel. It's only really when you take a drive that it can be seen. __The hotel has 2 beaches, one that is quite rocky with plenty of sunbeds and a restaurant and the other is a sandy beach (this is preferable with children). The sea is not really crystal clear and the conditions when we visited the beaches prohibited us from going in (too windy, dangerously high waves). We were informed by the staff at the beach that is was often like this.__The kids club and the staff are always on hand and go the extra mile to help you children enjoy the holiday with lots of activities throughout the day and into the evening. My wife and I actually questioned who was enjyoing it more, the kids or the staff. But we could not fault them at all.__Overall we enjoyed our holiday, the weather was fantastic, the hotel OK, the food below par, the surrounding area less than impressive, but the kids club fantastic. Would we go back again, not really, would we recommend it, not sure, probably if you have several kids and want them looked after whilst you relax by the pool then maybe._",1"We stayed for 4 nights in this hotel that was described as a 5 star lhw hotel. let's start with the positive things: 1) the hotel is very very clean 2) the staff is very friendly 3) very nice amenities( fitness,spa,swimmingpools). We booked half board, but we where very disapponited because half board meant buffet! if you want to eat in the hotel's restaurant, you have to pay 25 euros for each person for every night even if you have half board. so we took the buffet, the quality of the buffet is not better than in a school cantine! the food was cold....... 1st evening, the kids animation team had organized a kids disco under the restaurant where we had dinner, very loud music and screams from the children. the second night, the animation team had organized a kids cinema night till 22:00 just in front of our room, very noisie and loud till 23:00. the third night the animatioun group had organized a kids musical just in front of our room it should stop at 22:00 but it went on till i called the receptionnist to complain about the loud music. the manager apologized by mail. the 4 th night there was a live music dinner just in front of our room till 23:00. so this is probably a good place to stay in if you have children and want to have a club athmisphere, but if you are a couple serkong for calm, this is not the right place to stay, even if it s called a golf and spa resort",1"I stayed at the hotel for a week at the end of May 2012 with my girlfriend and 2 year old daughter. The hotel itself is spectacular and immaculate and the facilities in the room are the best I've experienced. However, the quality, selection and cost of food was a let down. There is simply not enough choice and the quality does not justify the price tag. Not all restaurants were open when I stayed, which I accept, but the menus are limited nonetheless. And vegetable tempura is not worth 23 euros no matter who cooks it. Most restaurants open at 7.30 also. A little late for most young children's dinner time. We were often forced to eat bar snacks or have room service. Another disappointment was that not one outdoor pool was heated. Not great for kids. It seems at first that the service is terrific but during the week part of our food or drinks order was forgotten on 4 separate occasions. This could be a great hotel but a little more effort on service is required. One last thing. A fireworks display at 11pm is not very thoughtful.",1"When you drive up to the gates it certainly has the wow factor. It is a stunning hotel and the pools are lovely. The staff are very professional, I would go with professional over friendly or helpful. You could have a very nice stay here and completely relax. I thought the food was poor to average and very over priced for what it was. We came here for a good friends wedding. Please be aware the wedding planner was a young inexperienced women. Who was very rude and practically unhelpful to the bride and groom, we're not talking about a bridezilla here. Other people witnessed it and were shocked. So if you are planning a wedding here check they have changed the wedding planner or be prepared for a frustrating time. The setting for the wedding was stunning and we did have a beautiful day. The hotel would not let the bride wear her $4000 Vera Wang dress to her dinner even though we were dining alone, in case it bothered other guests. It was very quite when we went which as a adult only group was lovely, but a bit eerie the hotel was quite empty. The spa staff had gone home early because there were no clients for them. The bride did mention the problems with wedding planner in front of the hotel manager and instead of him acting on it, he skulked away. As a group none of us would return.",1"Booked trip at the last minute and stayed in fab 3BR villa with private pool...perfect equation for what we were looking for: family vacation in Italy with excellent food, wine, luxurious accommodations in a chic beach resort setting...food in main hotel restaurant as well as outdoor brick oven pizza restaurant was incredible...Note: the buffet restaurant over in the Borgo townhouse area is a bit disappointing, as well as the townhouse accomodations (we were curious to see one, and found them to be extremely narrow and cramped and would NOT want to stay in the townhouse section of the property)...beach club was fantastic as well as golf...finally, great place to go for luxe villa accommodation on the Adriatic!",1"We recently spent a week at Borgo Egnazia and overall had a fantastic time, with one caveat - the food. The hotel is beautifully presented and exceptionally comfortable and the service was great. However we felt it necessary to point out a big area of disappointment the food. We stayed as half board guests and this meant having to eat a buffet in the evenings or at lunch that was tasteless and very obviously the cheap option (compared to the a la carte menu). __The food was nicely presented but it was unseasoned, and consisted of obviously cheap options like rice salad, poor cuts of meat and baked pasta dishes that weren't cooked to order - which in Italy seems a crime. We were so disappointed that on several evenings we opted to go out to local restaurants where the food was much better. It's a shame that such a lovely hotel lets itself down on the food, particularly in Italy.",1"After working with the UK Forces in Afghanistan for 6 months I was really excited about coming on holiday to Italy to stay at the beautiful Borgo Egnazia hotel. My friend had booked online and for weeks I had been almost salivating over the pictures - I really needed a tranquil holiday to completely relax. The hotel looked beautiful on our arrival and our twin room was very clean and welcoming. I would have like more comfortable seating on the balcony, but other than that, the room was fine.__However, I was dismayed to discover that although 3 restaurants were advertised on the website, only one was open and it was like being in the middle of a kids' Mickey Mouse club in Disneyland - not quite the tranquil setting as had been heavily advertised. I appreciate that it was the August holidays, but the kids were even marauding round the only bar - not appropriate at 11pm in a 5 star hotel. __Whilst the breakfasts were great (the scrambled egg was sublime), and the food in the restaurant during the evening was beautifully presented, I don't think it was anywhere near 5 star standard. My friend who is vegetarian, suffered the same humiliating ritual every night of having to ask for a vegetarian option. Some evenings she was offered only boiled vegetables - this is not acceptable. The Maitre D should have organised a proper alternative, as we were there for two weeks. Some evenings the din from the children was so bad that we asked for room service and were made to feel like social pariahs.__Getting to the beach was interesting. After having to queue for over half an hour, we were taken in a minibus to the wrong beach. Eventually we were dropped off at the main beach and were very disappointed to find that there were not enough parasols to go round all the sunbeds, and the atmosphere that they had tried to create was a bit strange. We both preferred the poolside - the big pools are stunning and immaculate and the bar and pool staff were fantastic. Lovely clean towels and the most comfortable sunloungers I have ever been on. However, once again, were were surrounded by children - perhaps the hotel should look to making one of the pools adults only.__The spa facilities are lovely and I had a very professional sports massage whilst there.__The hotel is essentially out of the way, so a car would have been useful. There is no nearby village or small town to walk to in the evening (which we would have done to escape) so the only alternative is a taxi which gets rather expensive. Perhaps the hotel should think of laying on transport two or three evenings a week so people can get out and explore the lovely towns in the area.__Overall I was deeply disappointed with the holiday. We didn't relax anywhere near as much as we needed to and I would have been happier roughing it camping in Devon. A real shame, as the holiday cost in the region of £6,000 between us. I won't be going there again and I wouldn't recommend it to anyone.",1"Having seen the beautiful interiors on the web site we booked a grande suite. On arrival we were informed that they had no suites left and we were given a Townhouse. Although part of the same hotel, the townhouses interiors are not contemporary, luxurious or indeed practical for a family. They are best described as simple white walled 3 star self catering in Corfu. There was no where to relax and the bedrooms were tiny with next to no storage! Having seen a suite in the hotel and a villa I can confirm that they are beautiful and as described on the web site. The resort is new and has a few teething issues however the staff around the pool, in reception, kids club and restaurant were excellent. Food great but could do with an alternative. Pool area lovely and comfortable. Would definetly return to a suite in the main hotel or a villa BUT definetly not a townhouse. Once complete I think Borgo Egnazia will become a great luxury contemporary resort ideal for couples and families.",1"This is a great hotel so the question is why oh why oh why have they built so many truly terrible ""two bedroon townhouses"". You cannot open the cupboards as the rooms are SO SMALL. You can touch all four walls from sitting on the bed. The stairs are a DEATHTRAP for young children. The rooms are small and dark with no views at all. Stay at this hotel but not in the townhouses.",1I stayed at the Borgo Egnazia for a week in the summer. The place was very charming and I felt very comfortable here. The service was great and everyone was extremley friendly and knowledgeable. The resort is fantastic looking; the architecture is amazing. The landscape was also beautiful and I am glad that I picked a place like this. I would recommend this resort to anyone traveling to the area and I hope to return some day.,0My wife and I have greatly enjoyed our stays.  The staff has always been attentive and knowledgeable.  The food is amazing and the rooms beautiful.  I am looking forward to our next trip.  Maybe next time there will be a little less time on the beach and a little more time on the golf course.  ,0"I recently had the opportunity to stay at Borgo Egnazia Puglia. I would recommend this resort to anyone who is planning on vacationing in Italy. The grounds are magnificent. I had a suite in their luxurious hotel. The decor was unique and beautiful. I felt like royalty as I was made to feel very special. The cuisine was excellent. The resort offers a golf course, for those who choose to partake. The resort has large swimming pools and a beach for swimming or just basking in the sun. All in all this was the best vacation resort I have ever gone too. ",0an awesome week spent relaxing and enjoying this Italian resort.  An amazingly beautiful resort  so easy to enjoy.  Sitting by the pools relaxing with a drink and going for a dip.  The food was absolutely delicious  and served so elegantly.  The nervous was impeccable at every urn.  A once in a lifetime experience. One wew will never forget.,0"My stay at the Borgo Egnazia was an absolute delight. Both my wife and I were excited to go from the pictures we saw online, but they absolutely do not do justice to the beauty of the resort. If you are looking to be relaxed and pampered, this is the place for you. Both my wife and I like to keep to ourselves on holidays, so this was the perfect choice for us. Within our villa, we felt so wonderfully secluded it was as if we were the only people for miles around. Of course, when we did step out to be with people, we enjoyed the delightful service of the resort staff.  /  / Can't wait to return next year!",0"Talk about an amazing experience! The Borgo Egnazia Puglia provides all that and a bag of chips, from stunning rooms to an immaculate, peaceful setting and all of the amenities I could every desire, this hotel is truly an immaculate place to stay. My room was huge, filled with neutral colors for a tranquil environment that made it hard to want to leave. I loved the outstanding customer service, the upscale, on-site restaurants, concierge service and   the abundance of activities ranging from golf to tennis. Of course the spa was a really special treat that spoiled me so much. For anyone who wants to stay in absolute luxury, a world within a hotel, this is the can't miss destination.",0"My husband and I stayed at the Borgo Egnazia Puglia for our honeymoon and thoroughly enjoyed ourselves.  The rooms were decorated simply and beautifully and were very comfortable.  Sitting poolside and soaking up the sun was very relaxing.  My husband enjoyed a few rounds of golf on their golf course while I enjoyed the Vair Spa.  The views of the surrounding areas were unbeatable, and every restaurant and bar we visited was beyond our expectations.  The resort offers so many things to occupy your time when you're not relaxing.  We played tennis, went horseback riding, rode go karts, tried scuba diving and even took a cooking class.  This was a memorable vacation and we hope to return for first anniversary.",0"In my search for the perfect Italian resort, I came across the wonderful Borgo Egnazia Puglia. Everything about my stay exceeded my expectations! At first I was skeptical about taking my vacation their, but after doing some online research, the choice was clear. The amazing weather I experienced during my stay certainly helped my attitude towards Borgo Egnazia Puglia, but that's not the only reason I recommend this resort. /  / Located directly on the water, the views were amazing and the air was crisp and clear. Every breath I took was equally invigorating and refreshing. The decor and style of the resort is very pleasing to the senses, and a great blend of traditional architecture and modern conveniences. /  / The rooms were very clean, and the staff extremely helpful and prompt. The pool was plenty large enough that I never felt crowded by the other guests. I enjoyed my time in the cafe as well where the food and service (once again) exceeded my expectations. My suite had a balcony with an amazing view that I also spent a fair amount of time enjoying. /  / The rooms were very comfortably furnished, and my bed was more comfortable than the bed I have at home! I heard a lot of good things about the on site golf course, but I'm not that avid of a player so I can't speak from experience in that regard. /  / All in all, it was an extremely pleasant visit, and I highly recommend Borgo Egnazia Puglia for your Italian vacation",0"My husband and I went here for our honeymoon. I definitely would NOT recommend it. The views in the catalogue look great, but the only thing we could see from our window was the window of the building next door. The room was very dirty. We found bits of mud and brush in the bed, as if the person who made the bed had just come in from gardening and made the bed before washing her hands. We forgot to put the cap on our toothpaste, and in the morning there were ants crawling all over the bathroom counter. If you're looking for a quiet escape from reality, look elsewhere.",0"Good hotel staff bad experience. / I would want you to be careful that you are not deceived by appearance. I am an avid hotel user and I recently went to Borgo Egnazia Puglia hotel. The staff there is wonderful but the room I stayed in was not up to expectations. It first glance, you could pass my room up as clean but with the experience I have, I know looks can be deceiving. There was strands of hair under the sheets, the tub was not properly cleaned though it may look clean. It is not what I expected for a 5 star hotel. If you intend on lodging at this hotel, at least be sure to ask for new sheets.",0"My stay at this resort was nothing but horrendous. My husband and I booked the weekend for our honeymoon. The receptionist was very rude and impatient. We asked for the private suite which overlooks the lake and instead got a regular room. The sheets had yellow stains and the room smelled like smoke. We checked behind the mattress and there was a dead roach under the bed. We were horrified. The hotel looked great online but in reality this place was poorly managed and maintained. My husband and I complained to the manager, got our money back and stayed at another resort.",0"My husband and I stayed at the Borgo Egnazia Puglia on our recent trip to Italy.  We were expecting a luxurious property and we were greatly disappointed.  GREATLY.  The cleanliness of the rooms was deplorable.  The sheets had spots on them, the counters in the bathroom were stained, the shower had a coating of soap scum on all surfaces and the in room coffee machine looked like it hadn't been cleaned in weeks. /  / The spa was terrible too.  They were very short staffed, so no walk-ins were available.  You had to make an appointment in advance, and even then you had to wait a half an hour or more past your appointment time.  And once in, it wasn't worth the wait.  I have never had such a tepid, unenthusiastic massage in my life.",0" I arrived at the Borgo Egnazia Puglia at 3 pm.The worker at the front desk was preoccupied talking to his girlfriend on the phone,he was desperately trying to keep her from breaking up with him-just ignoring the fact I was there ,ready to check in.When I opened the door to my room,there was a family already in there,that had rented the room.What a bunch of crap.Had to go back down,he didn't believe me.30 minutes later,I arrived in ""my"" room.All seemed well,til I was standing at the sliding door that leads to the outside-I could smell mildew or pee,turns out,it was the drapes over the door. /  I paid for a room,but my privacy had to be broken,while I waited for a cleaning lady with a ladder-changing the drapes,instead of giving me a new room. /  Everyything else went well,I thought.Til I arrived back after dinner.It was about 10pm.Walking down the hallway,I could see that my door was opened,a little,I know I closed it and double checked that it was locked.I was mad,I called the front desk,the manager apologised,but I was mad,I wanted a refund,I am leaving. /  After bickering for 30 minutes,the manager called their corporate office,agreed to give me a refund,BUT,it will be mailed to me within 30 days? Oh,that just really made everything worse. /  You will never see me within 10 miles  of this place,ever.",0"We had high expectations of this resort.  The pictures looked beautiful and we were desperately looking for relaxation but we got anything but.  First, it was extremely expensive, which we thought was because it was so nice, but it turns out it is just a rip off.  They nickel and dime you for everything (nothing is included) and service people are no wear around.  It looks almost nothing like the pictures; it is crowded and run down.  See all the empty loungers at the pool?  Try getting one of them.  Or a drink in the bar without waiting in line.  Won't do it again, that's for sure.",0" My recent Borgo Egnazia stay was a disappointment.  Since when does french fries and other fried foods represent local food which follows the Mediterranean diet which the brochure promised?  Also, the beach was not as spectacular as I thought.  It was very rocky and was quite uncomfortable to walk on.  Also, the beach was kind of noisy and was not the secluded, exclusive, relaxing atmosphere which I had expected.  Although the staff was helpful, they were a little arrogant and didn't seem too friendly towards Americans.  I would have hoped to find some authentic local experiences, but was steered towards the tourist traps and other overpriced places.  Overall, the quality and luxury was not quite what I was promised and what I would have expected for the money I paid.",0"I recently traveled to Italy and stayed at the Borgo Egnazia Puglia with my girlfriend and some family members. I was drawn to stay here because of the beautiful photographs and descriptions I have seen from this resort. Unfornutely that is about as good as it got because when we arrived it just didn‚Äôt seem to meet our expectations. It had a bit of an old run down feel. Obviously this part of Italy is beautiful but when travelling halfway around the world I was expecting something more contemporary, as this felt cold and medieval. We made the best of our trip and had a great time but I wouldn‚Äôt stay here again, I would rather book something that is more tailored to a luxury getaway that aims to pamper/please it's guests.",0"My wife and I recently stayed at the Borgo Egnazia Puglia for three days, and it safe to say that we will never come back to this resort.  Although the brochure was very inviting, our experience was a bit of a nightmare to say the least.  To begin, check-in took over an hour and a half to due a lost reservation.  Once we actually got into our room, we were shocked to find it small, cramped, and dusty., nothing like the bright and cheery rooms in the brochure.    Room service was slow, expensive, and frequently got our order wrong.  Additionally, the location is poor, the food quality of the restaurant is sub-par, and the pool was closed for our entire stay.  Stay away from this one!!",0"I had really high expectations for Borgo Egnazia.  The brochure made it look like a beautiful resort, but I found when I got there that what you see is not necessarily what you get.  First off, the staff seemed really apathetic, like we were bothering them just by checking in and asking basic questions.  The rooms were attractive but it was extremely difficult to get any help when we found that the air conditioning didn't work.  They made it seem like we were bothering them when we had to ask several times for them to see about fixing it!  The food was okay, but very expensive and pretty limited as to what was available.  The beach was not peaceful as it was crowded with noisy kids every time we went there.  We also wanted to try some spa services but after paying their extremely high prices, we decided we would have done better if my husband and I just gave each other a backrub ourselves- they didn't seem to know what they were doing.  Overall, your money is better spent elsewhere!",0"With over 50 loose leaf teas in my cupboard, this is one of my consistent favorites. The peach aroma and flavoring is distinct, but not overwhelming. The nutty roasted oolong base continues to shine through. This is a solid tea at a great price.",1"The flavoring is well-blended into this tea. In contrast to pure oolongs with a natural peachy aroma, this tea displays its peach flavoring mainly in the finish.",1"It's pretty good tea overall. This is one of the only brands of loose leaf tea available in my area, so I drink this stuff up often. It is, however, kind of dry in comparison to some other brands of Earl Grey I've tried. The Bergamot oil is pretty light in this brand.",1"I find this to be a very good Earl Grey tea. It isn't too heavy in flavor, but still gives my tastebuds a treat when I drink it.",1I like strong flavours. Twinings delivers a strong flavoued Earl Grey tea where the bergarmot is easily noticeable and great on the pallet. The % of bergarmot is even listed on the pack. This is the only brand that I have seen that does this. However the tea can come from different countries and you never know from which country the tea is sourced.,1"I normally don't like flavored tea, but this is an exception. The taste wasn't as sour as other flavored teas I've tried and it wasn't overpowering at all. Overall I enjoyed this tea and will be drinking it again.",1"I am so glad Trader joe's carries a white tea. This is my favorite tea they sell, one bag brews up a pretty strong flavored tea. The pomegranate flavor is very strong, but in a good way.",1I really liked this tea. It wasn't too strong or acidic and had a nice flavor.,1"Mellow, smooth, rich malty flavor. Deep red color; little bitterness or astringency. Very enjoyable. I find this tea grows on me. There is a suggestion of sweet fruit in the aroma, almost like baked apples.",1"Ironically, this tea is significantly less peachy in aroma than a number of pure (unflavored) oolongs I've had, including Adagio's own Dancong Aria.",1"Adagio recommends brewing 5 minutes, but I found that 3 minutes yielded a cup more to my liking. The leaf was broken and the tea infused rather quickly.",1"As others have said, Twinings is light on bergamot. When I've used Twinings, I've often added lemon juice after the fact to give it more citrus.",1"Fair nose dominated by the bergamot. Made from the bag, the steeped tea has no truly distinctive flavors. My guess is that by the time it made it through the distribution chain, all the life had oxidized out of this tea.",1"I'm not a huge fan of hibiscus, and I dislike when a tea includes hibiscus as a main ingredient without including it in the name of the blend. Perhaps the marketers think casual tea drinkers will mistake hibiscus for pomegranate, because of the tangy quality and red color, but I'm not fooled. Yes, hibiscus tastes fruity, but no, it cannot be interchanged with generic red-colored fruits!",1"Cheap, but what is cheap if I don't like it? I'm especially hard on Trader Joe's for their tea selection...they have such high-quality goods in other areas, even coffee. And their tea remains, in my opinion, pretty far below the level of quality of their other products.",1"It's been a while since I tried this so my review is from a fuzzy memory, but I remember this tea blend as being fleetingly fruity and not having much of a strong presence of the base tea at all. Tasted pretty low quality, but then I've been consistently underwhelmed by Trader Joe's teas, so this was not surprising.",1My reaction to this tea was pretty much: eh. I resent paying luxury rates for a tea that tastes like a budget hotel.,1"I woke up one morning needing a serious wake up call from my cup of tea.  Runa's peppermint guayusa definitely did the trick. Between the  refreshingly crisp smell of peppermint, and the smooth taste of guayusa I  was ready to start my day within minutes.",0I was so impressed with the peppermint guayusa blend I had to try the  traditional guayusa. I was pleased to discover that I enjoyed this one  just as much. It has an ample amount of caffeine kick combined with a  sweetness that is lacking in yerba mate. I would definitely recommend  everyone give this a try.,0"Great tasting tea, especially good for breakfast with or without milk!!!",0"Lovely flavour. No bitterness if brewed strong.""",0Love this as either teabag or loose - loose gives slightly 'airier' drink.  Teabag more 'builders'.,0"This tea is delicious and refreshing, and can be drunk at any time of the day. It is as good as any I have drunk in China or Singapore. I love to smell the leaves when I open the tea caddy; for me this is as important a part of the tea as the flavour! I now live in Brazil, but the only thing that I still bring back from trips to Europe is Clipper Organic loose green tea!",0Never has a tea bag made me so happy :D,0"This tea is amazing.  It's a nice strong, black tea with a perfectly infused flavor of maple. The balance is absolutely perfect. Breathing in a steaming mug of this tea on a winter's day is one of my favorite pleasures. The maple is very true; I'm a maple lover, but I don't care for fake maple flavoring. This tea is the real deal.",0"This tea is perfect. The coconut flavor is very well-blended with the other chai spices, and not overpowering.  The aroma of this tea is intoxicating. The black tea leaves are a perfect match for the nerve-calming chai herbs. Invigorating and soothing all at once.",0"This tea really is the perfect after dinner treat! The aroma is very invigorating and fresh- I wasn't sure the flavor would match the aroma, but it definitely did. Very good blend of tummy-pleasing herbs. All-around good.",0"Amazing. I have tried this tea both hot and iced, and it is equally wonderful both ways.",0The aroma is very full and sensual- the jasmine and earl grey come together beautifully for a flavor that is relaxing and invigorating all at once. I love this tea!,0"This is without a doubt my favorite jasmine pearl tea. The aroma is so crisp and true to real jasmine. It's not too bitter, just perfectly green and floral.  I love this tea, but it is a bit too expensive for me. I have found other jasmine pearl teas at a lower price, but of course none have compared to this one.",0This tea is so tasty. It didn't have a very strong scent so I wasn't expecting a lot of flavor.  Boy was I wrong.  I can taste both the chocolate and the orange flavors - kind of like those chocoate orange candies.  Super good:),0"A delicious, delightful tea. Definitely one of my all-time favorites.",0This is the best American Earl Grey I have ever tasted.,0A decent black tea. A pretty decent black tea.,0
