    "Great staff all very good, Great location. Our room was excellent and the breakfast was very good. ", 
    "Excellent hotel, great location, friendly staff, would really recommended this hotel.", 
    "Gutes Hotel zu fairem Preis in der Stadtmitte Chicagos, kann ohne Vorbehalt empfohlen werden!", 
    "My mom and I arrived early for check in and the staff allowed us to check in early with no additional charges. The room was clean and comfortable. The only complaint was the view out the window that was just another building, but not unexpected because we stayed in the city.", 
    "My sister and I loved this boutique hotel. It was quiet and was within a short walking distance to all forms of mass transportation. The staff were friendly, helpful and the rooms were very clean and roomy. We loved being able to have the continental breakfast (cereal, danishes, fruit, yogurt, donuts, etc.) which was provided on each floor. People actually felt comfortable walking out to get their breakfast with their PJ's on then head back to their rooms. It helped on time and provided good nourishment as we headed out for the day. Also enjoyed complimentary drinks (one per person per day) from 5-8 each day. There were so many restaurants within walking distance and a short walk to Navy pier. We would definitely come back as we liked the size of the hotel compared to the larger chains.", 
    "Location is perfect for any downtown activities...right in the heart of all the action. Short walk to everything.C-Train, buses and taxis all very handy...only small complaint was they placed us in a special needs room so the shower was just a floor and a curtain...not a big deal, just a bit different. Continental breakfast was handy (set up on table by elevators) and coffee was fresh. Staff were courteous and room was quiet and clean. Over all it was a pleasant experience. ", 
    "Kinzie Hotel staff processed my check-in quickly. The room was clean and well-appointed (loved the double shower head). I got a great room with a decent view of Kinzie Street ... I appreciated being able to look out and see what was going on around me. I thought the daily continental breakfast had a good range of selections and I really appreciated that there was a breakfast spread on each floor so that I didn't have to wander around the building looking for it. The Kinzie will definitely be my go-to spot for future Chicago visits.", 
    "This hotel is centrally located in the downtown area close to Everything (with a capital \"E\"). It was a quick walk away from the L (Blue Line from the airport gets you there) and steps away from restaurants, bars, and convenience stores. The amenities are reasonable overall, but the daily continental breakfast on each floor is pretty awesome. Great for a quick bite and tea/coffee on the way out. The gym was impressive and had everything I could have hoped for. The bed was very comfortable, and facing a brick wall was not as bad as I first thought it might be. I did, however, have issues with the front desk staff, who I think could have been much more polite, welcoming, and willing to assist. At the time of my check-in at 7pm, I found a dirty plate outside of my room and wondered if I had the wrong room number. I checked the key and it worked, so I wondered why the plate was there. As it turns out, it would remain there until the following morning when the housekeeping staff attended to the room; I had to walk past this crumby plate at least 6 times after I got there. When I asked the front desk staff about it, they said it was standard for guests to leave plates outside the rooms after the nightly appetizer/cocktail reception. They looked at me like I was crazy for thinking that I should find a clean room and entryway upon checking in. When did these people eat appetizers, leave the plate, and check out?! Check out is 12pm! The staff could have been much friendlier overall.", 
    "Nice boutique hotel, centrally located close to Millenium Park, Magnificent Mile and The Loop. Rooms were clean, comfortable and modern. Front desk staff were great, easy check-in and check-out while being very accommodating. I would recommend staying at the Kinzie.", 
    "We thoroughly enjoyed our stay! The hotel is in a fantastic location! We were minutes away from great restaurants, shopping, and museum/tourist sights. The hotel was spotless and the staff was extremely friendly and helpful. I would definitely recommend The Kinzie! ", 
    "loved this hotel, only downside I can think of is one of the free doughnuts I had with breakfast wasn't completely delicious ", 
    "The Kinzie is a great hotel one block off State Street and within walking distance to just about everything. The staff is super helpful and the rooms are a good size for downtown, comfortable and very clean. The room we had was above a car lot and alarms went off occasionally but not the hotels fault. Overall a great experience ", 
    "Had a great stay at the Kinzie. Hotel and staff are fantastic. ", 
    "I like the breakfast served on each floor! Room size is very spacious.", 
    "Overall great experience!! Nice staff, cool hotel, and great location. I could not ask for anything more. Would stay here again.", 
    "Good hotel, room a little small, not enough place to put the clothes for the whole family (4). The view was of a parking lot and it was noisy at night. What we simply couldn't understand is why on Earth the toilet has no lid??? It looks ugly and it is uncomfortable. The location is good, walking distance to almost everywhere. Breakfast is mediocre and not always enough for the guests, people were going to all floors to look for some pastry, which was the best part of breakfast. It was nice to hear welcome back from Drake at the door. Staff is kind.", 
    "Everything about this hotel is fine except for the noise at night. There are several bars/clubs nearby and you can hear music, shouting, etc all night long. It was difficult to get a good night's sleep. Kinzie needs to noise proof the rooms.", 
    "From the first check in to checkout the staff was wonderful. Every effort was made to accommodate everything we needed. I would recommend the hotel to everyone. It is a great location within walking distance to many tourist sites.", 
    "Great location for the full 'Chicago experience'. The only downside was our windows faced another building and we could look right into their apartments when our shades were not down. A side effect of urban apartments/hotels. The breakfast buffet was nicely stocked and satisfied our needs, although not in a separate area... (in the hallway on each floor by the elevators). ", 
    "Awesome experience. Was able to drive up to front of hotel, have car parked and was in and up to my room within minutes. Awesome breakfast in the morning on each floor by the elevator. Easy to grab some food and drink and take back to my room. Called down in the morning to have car ready and easy checkout. Car waiting outside ready to go.", 
    "We needed a break from the gloomy weather of Detroit so we decided to go to Chicago last minute. Stumbled upon this amazing hotel with a great deal. Great location just blocks from Michigan Ave and fun bars and restaurants!! Parking is a little steep at $62, but worth it with all the places nearby and the cleanliness of this hotel. Super clean and awesome decor. They have a cocktail hour with free apps. Didn't quite make it to the free breakfast in the morning but I'm sure it would have been worth it. Would visit again! ", 
    "The staff was very helpful with suggestions on what to do, hotel was walking distance to river dying and parade and all the good bars... The cocktail hour was great, the breakfast only offers pastries and such no hot foods ", 
    "Very nice hotel. Room was clean and room bed was comfortable. ", 
    "Everything was fine,but nothing was great. The decor detracted from an otherwise nice place. I've been here before and enjoyed more before the new design renovations. Fine for the price .", 
    "When checking into the Kinzie, we were so surprised about how beautiful it was inside. The staff at the hotel lobby were so welcoming and friendly. The rooms had great space and the bathroom was fairly large. The beds were so comfortable and the rooms were so quiet!!! The complimentary breakfast was great. It was served on each floor right in front of the elevators. They had muffins, danishes, coffee, yogurt, egg, etc, which was great. Only thing is that you need to go early because things do run out. They do replenish the breakfast often, but since there are 5 floors with breakfast, it might take a while before the attendant gets to your floor. They offer complimentary appetizers and cocktail drinks as a \"welcome.\" We did not get to the appetizers (starts at 5:30PM and we got there at 7); however, they did honor the drink with a \"drink token.\" We did not have any problems with hot water, which was great because we traveled in February and it was very cold outside. Overall, I was so happy with the hotel and I would definitely stay here again if traveling to Chicago!! Great boutique hotel! ", 
    "My daughter and I had a long weekend in Chicago and had the best experience ever staying at the Kinzie. I originally booked this hotel for us because my daughter's name is \"Kinsey\" and thought it was just destiny! The staff was absolutely wonderful and made us feel like we were just part of the family!! They looked up tickets to shows, told us how to get to our destinations, hailed taxis, got our car, helped us pack the car, and more importantly, just \"loved on us\". I highly recommend the Kinzie!!! We can't wait to return...................when it's warmer :).", 
    "Terrible weather in Chicago last weekend, so I spent more time in the hotel than I normally would. The staff was fantastic, as were the accommodations. ", 
    "We stayed over Valentine's Day weekend, and immediately we were impressed by guest services. We were greeted at the door and offered a Valentine's Day sugar cookie. Check in was very quick and efficient. The staff is extremely friendly. Our room was everything we could have wanted with everything you could imagine needing. The managers reception on the sixth floor was a great time and made a lasting impression on us. With complimentary hors d'oeuvres and two complementary drinks for the Both of us we were completely satisfied before going out to dinner. Speaking of going out, it is centrally located and easy to get to fantastic restaurants within walking distance. It is right next-door to the bar public house which is a popular night spot. We will absolutely be staying again.", 
    "Our stay was wonderful if I had to say anything it would be that I wish breakfast was in one location.", 
    "Stayed here for one night while in town for business. It has a great location for getting to many restaurants within walking distance. Easy check in and good stay.", 
    "El hotel es muy bueno para estadias cortas, el personal es muy amable esta bien ubicado muy cerca de las atracciones turisticas. Tal vez lo que cambiaria es que el desayuno es un poco monotono", 
    "This is the second time that I have stayed at the Kinzie Hotel. The hotel is comfortable with great restaurants nearby. The staff is very helpful and the provided happy hour is good and a nice opportunity to regroup with colleagues. The only problem that I have is the valet parking is $65 and the lots on either adjacent blocks is $22.", 
    "It is always nice to stay at the Kinzie Hotel. Their breakfast is really convenient.", 
    "No frills. Modern room. Good location. Breakfast is convenient on each floor. ", 
    "Service and accomodations were very good. Location is very good.", 
    "I really liked the kinzie hotel when I first stepped into it. The hotel services were however a bit question-able. Mainly because of the following two issues: 1 - It said that it had a continental breakfast: Breakfast was served on every floor instead of a main dining area. Had very limited choices. All the food in the breakfast was of the cold type. The food ran out very quickly and was not promptly refilled unless we called them. Sometimes they forgot to put hot water for our tea, and had only coffee. 2 - I had a clogged bathroom at night. I kept calling the front desk, no one picked up. Nor did anyone get back to me. So I stayed the entire night with that situation. In the morning, I gave them the notice and they took care of it. I don't know if i will stay in the hotel again.", 
    "So great! I love this hotel! The breakfast was awesome (and included), the staff was super nice, and the location was really convenient and safe. I will stay here again!", 
    "We had a very easy stay. We came in the evening and left the following morning. We booked the hotel because it was near a restaurant event we were attending. The service was very good, the room had everything we needed and it is very nice that the free breakfast is by the elevator on every floor. We barely had to get dressed to walk down the hall and grab some cereal and juice!", 
    "Wonderful location, staff and rooms. Second stay here and not disappointed with my choice. The location is central to most of the city. Complimentary Wi-Fi, Cocktails between 5-8, and free continental breakfast each morning. All combined with a nice room. Will definitely be back again!!", 
    "stayed there for 2 nights. Very helpful staff. Rooms are good size, furniture are new and well designed. Kinzie is a solid alternative to higher priced competitors ", 
    "The hotel exceeded our expectations. The continental breakfast was much nicer quality than those I have experienced at other hotels. The hotel is stylish and modern yet simple and not over-the-top trendy. Everything smells clean and fresh. The complimentary hors d'oeuvres in the cocktail lounge every evening were a nice perk. I would definitely stay at Kinzie Hotel again in the future. ", 
    "Rate was reasonable and everything about this hotel was great. I believe it was recently renovated because everything looks brand new. Staff was great. Room was clean & bed was super comfortable. Was awesome having the continental breakfast set up on each floor, was right outside our room in the hallway near the elevators. All kinds of restaurants, bars & clubs within walking distance, was a great weekend stay.", 
    "I really enjoyed my stay. The hotel staff was great, I loved the design of the rooms. I can't wait to stay there again.", 
    "The Kinzie provided us a great location for eating, walking and shopping. THe interior of the hotel was also on a consistent basis as nothing was advertised that was not provided. Cleanliness and service were terrific and these are two things we look for", 
    "We went down for the Cubs convention. It was a perfect location.", 
    "I really enjoyed my stay. The staff was very friendly and helpful. I loved the decor!", 
    "This hotel is very modern and has good staff. The toilet or sink weren't working since check in day. We stayed there for a week, and the whole time we were there, we only used the shower. We had to go to the fifth floor to use the public bathroom. ", 
    "Everything was absolutely amZig!", 
    "Staff incredible! A jewel of a spot in a great location. Highly recommended!", 
    "Historisches Museum, gutes Essen, Shopping, Millenium Park.", 
    "Great place. Exceeded expectations, fantastic staff. I'd stay there again for sure.", 
    "We showed up early and they let us check in early. That was great!!! The valet parking guys was awesome!!! They took care of us, let us know where was a good place to eat.", 
    "Updated modern hotel, very good staff, convenient valet parking, great location close to many restaurants and bars. ", 
    "We have stayed at the Kinzie previously when it was the Amalfi. We love the location as it is easy to get to both the blue line when coming in from the airport. The hotel offers a great breakfast that is located at the elevator banks of each floor. You pick out what you would like to eat and go back to your room to relax. We always enjoy the evening reception on the 6th floor. I would have given the room a 5 star rating overall but I did find it was cool in our room on the 2nd floor. To remedy this, I wore the housecoat to warm up. The reception area had a nice treat ie. hot chocolate, cider and cookies in the afternoon. If you want a nice quiet hotel, I would recommend the Kinzie. From Calgary, Canada", 
    "Hotel was average. The package came with free cocktails and breakfast. The front desk only gave us 2 tokens for free drinks, but gave us 2 more for a total of 4 free drinks which wasn't bad. Breakfast was average. No hot food, but it was plentiful. The hotel itself is only 6 floors and putting it right in the middle of downtown leaves most rooms with bad city views. Our room we needed to close all the blinds because people in the buildings across from us could easily see inside. The room was spacious. Only other bad thing was parking. The garages nearby were all $50+ per night. Unless you did it online then you saved maybe $8.", 
    "The location was great. Convenient to walk to most places. The hotel was great with the add on features which made it an incredibly good deal. The breakfasts were so convenient and had a good variety. The cookies when we got back in the late afternoon waiting in the lobby was a great touch and the appetizers and bar in the evenings was awesome. The appetizers were great with a nice selection of cheeses...hit the spot before getting ready for an evening out. We also loved having the free wi fi. For the price, this hotel CANNOT be beat.", 
    "Parking was expensive $56 Breakfast was great.", 
    "Lovely hotel in a convenient location. Staff were all exceptional and willing to help the inexperienced visitor. I would definitely choose the Kinzie for a return visit.", 
    "Great stay for New Years. Great location to bars and restaurants . Rooms were very clean and modern along with h20 products included . I would definitely stay at this location again in the future. It's about a 15 min walk from Michigan avenue. You are about 2 blocks from Dearborn street. Cabs are not an issue to get from this location. Valet service is very quick .", 
    "Staff is always very friendly & helpful. Gold star employee of our stay is Rafi....great guy that really strives to make you feel welcome & at home!", 
    "Short but sweet. I was literally in the hotel for less than 12 hours but wish it was longer. The staff were very polite and the help yourself brekkie was awesome. The location was fantastic. It had a very \"Big City\" feel to it.", 
    "Really enjoyed our stay. The staff was extremely helpful, pleasant, and happy. They were prompt and attentive to every need that could possibly arise.", 
    "Enjoyed our brief 2 day stay. Conveniently located. ", 
    "Stayed here for the first time for 2 nights with my wife for our wedding anniversary. It is now our favorite hotel in Chicago. Location is AMAZING! Surrounded by restaurants, bars, & shopping in every direction. The Public House is right next door (great food & HUGE beer selection), Rossi's (The best 'dive bar' in the city) is right a round the corner. Harry Carey's Steakhouse is a block away. Kinzie Chop House (our favorite restaurant in Chicago) is 4 blocks west. The hotel itself is one of the cleanest I've ever stayed in. The staff was friendly & helpful. They give you complimentary drinks at their small bar on the 6th floor for every night you stay there. Plus they have a nice appetizer buffet there from 5-8 every night. My ONLY complaint is that they allow anyone in there (like kids) and there is NO TYPE of dress code required..... I'm not suggesting that a suit & tie should be required, but while we were there, there was a family of 4 that were basically having dinner at the appetizer buffet. (It's meats, cheeses, breads, etc. And NO ONE in that family was wearing shoes! They were walking around barefoot or with socks on, while everyone else there was basically dressed to go out for the evening. It was kinda gross & kinda trashy. The Kinzie Hotel is too good for that kind of behavior. But other than those particular guests, there ate absolutely NO complaints from me. We will definetly be staying there again!", 
    "Great place & great location.", 
    "Good location and nice staff. Free breakfast. But the wardrobe is too small for me.", 
    "2 nights, great get-a-away, perfect location. Friendly staff. ", 
    "We enjoyed our stay. The hotel is conveniently located to walk to the Chicago Theatre, Lawry's, Magnificent Mile. The room was clean and comfortable. The only very small complaint is the room door did not latch without making sure you pulled it closed and the bathroom door would not latch, but the door closed and it wasn't a problem for us. We loved the double headed shower. Beds were very comfortable. The staff was VERY friendly and available. Hope this helps your decision.", 
    "It was my husbands and my present to each other. We stayed in the heart of downtown Chicago during the Christmas holidays. The staff was very friendly and helpful to site seeing. Was disappointed that there was a hefty charge to park our car there. ", 
    "Hotel is nice besides the small fitness room. Also, I was double charged but that's human error. The lounge could have also been alil more appealing.", 
    "Loved this place. Perfect location, okay price (parking is not included), great room. Will definitely stay here again.", 
    "Generally a good experience. Hotel is very accessible to hot spots. My only negative is that the HVAC system seemed to be always running. Nonstop slight draft through vents.", 
    "Nice hotel with helpful staff. Very convenient location.", 
    "Very happy with our stay and plan on coming back in the summer!", 
    "My family and I had a wonderful stay during Thanksgiving. The location was ideal but the hotel was the highlight for us. I really liked the room and the breakfast served on each floor very convenient. I plan on staying here my next visit.", 
    "Awesome", 
    "We enjoyed our stay and overall a great place to stay long term. We spent four nights and the king size bed was comfortable and the pillows divine! The location was great for walking to wonderful places to dine and shop. All the employee's were kind,friendly,very helpful, and ready to serve you. My husbands only complaint was there was no comfortable chair to relax in, instead a bar stool type chair. My complaint is they need to put an extra light in bathroom near tub and something on tub bottom so you don't slip and fall in tub. Other than these few things everything else was super!", 
    "Room decoration was very nice and size of the room was also more spacious than the picture. Very central location so, very close to every attraction but in the same time little away from the main street so, quite and less hectic. Very comfortable bed and pillow. Both Hot drink in a room and front desk(Hot cocoa) were very good. Breakfast was simple so little disappointed at first, but various muffin was really good taste, boiled egg and nice coffee, fruit, tazo tea ...were all good. But someone who expect a great view from the room, then should try different hotel because this hotel is surrounded and blocked by the other buildings very closely so hard to expect nice city view and only 6th story building. Overall room quality was top notch. ", 
    "Excelente hotel, muy recomendable y un trato excelente", 
    "I would use it again. Mianly because it is close to my family. It was a good value too.", 
    "The hotel was great, very modern decor, spacious rooms & good service. The only disappointment was \"breakfast\" but overall it was a fabulous place", 
    "Lovely hotel. Wonderful lounge on premises. Spacious and comfy rooms. Great staff. We were pleasantly surprised!", 
    "We had a great time spending the weekend in this hotel. Very convenient and close to almost all the spots we wanted to go and visit on the city. The staffs are friendly and very helpful. Will definitely come back. ;-)", 
    "We stayed for a long weekend and had a wonderful time. The hotel is in a superb location, and the room was very nice! We would definitely stay there again", 
    "It was the most impressive value I have had at any hotel in memory. Super clean and fresh room and upscale amenities like bathrobes. Plenty of room to meet with a colleague in a regular king room. They give you two tokens for free drinks at private cocktail hour each night. The free breakfast was not only 20x better than the norm, it was available on each floor. It was so pleasant all the guests who passed by were friendlier than any other hotel bkfst, one pointed out the wooden tray in each room made taking coffee, juice and more back to your room. Friendly service and gave me free little extras I appreciated. Outstanding!", 
    "we had made a special note that we were celebrating our engagement and 30th birthday on this short getaway. The hotel put a family with a screaming infant beside us. We had to switch rooms and hotel staff were not helpful in this matter. They ended up putting us in an even noisier area of the hotel. Coming form this industry ourselves we were disgusted at this. I would not recommend this hotel. They told us breakfast was included and it was a tiny set up right in front of the elevators - GROSS. The hotel itself is tiny.", 
    "We normally stay in larger chain hotels; so glad we tried somewhere new. We thoroughly enjoyed everything about our stay. The hotel room had great style. The location could not have been better for exploring downtown. The staff was friendly and helpful. We will certainly stay again when in downtown Chicago.", 
    "The temperature was very hot and then suddenly very cold. Same experience with the shower/bath. The floral wallpaper was just strange, but the variety of colorful lighting options more than made up for it. I'd do it all again in a heartbeat.", 
    "Simple comfortable accommodations for the business traveller. Great continental breakfast on floor. Good variety of restaurants within short walking distance. Reliable Wi-Fi.", 
    "I was pleasantly surprised by the hotel room...it was fairly roomy, very clean, and chic. I enjoyed the happy hour they had and the morning buffet that was standard. The only issue I had was during check out as there were only 2 agents and it was extremely busy. Nice hotel and I would def stay again.", 
    "Exc staff, front desk, valet, bell hop etc.", 
    "Spacious, comfortable room in a great location. This one is easy to recommend. ", 
    "Great stay and location. The Kinzie was close enough to access downtown conference centers during the day and central to restaurants and shopping of River North for evening activity. Rooms are contemporary and comfortable, and staff is friendly.", 
    "From the door man to the cleaning lady, everyone at the Kinzie was exceptionally accommodating. I especially liked the free continental breakfast at the elevator lobby of each floor, and the 2 free happy hour drink tokens upon arrival. I look forward to staying at the Kinzie in the future!", 
    "Great hotel. Close to many restaurants and shopping. Friendly staff. Good breakfast choices. Would definitely stay there again.", 
    "Very good hotel", 
    "Quiet and comfortable, very nice experience. The worst part of the experience is this survey. ", 
    "This was are second stay and we where again very satisfied Megan at desk very helpfull, all the staff very friendly. We had agreat time and the whole stay was enjoyable. Hotel is within walking distance to many restaurants and shopping . Moring breakfast and cocktails a big plus, will stay again while visiting our son. l ", 
    "Hotel was clean and met all expectations. The two doormen were exceptionally nice and made our children smile and laugh every time we left or returned. Breakfast was conveniently located on every floor.", 
    "I was in town for some important business. The staff at the front desk were very courteous. The rooms were quiet, very clean. The furniture was modern and the beds were very comfortable. I loved that there was a breakfast on each floor. I had a busy morning preparing for a presentation later in the day and having breakfast and coffee literally right outside my door was very convenient. Strong showers and I loved the H20+ amenities. I would recommend this hotel for business travelers. ", 
    "Enjoyed the location. Great friendly, helpful staff. Many great places to eat close by.", 
    "Trevlig personal. Bra frukost", 
    "Hotel employees were warm and welcoming. Stay was short but perfect.", 
    "Parking was expensive.", 
    "My husband and I had a short weekend getaway without our kids to celebrate our anniversary and birthdays. After much researching online, I chose the Kinzie Hotel for our stay. We were extremely pleased with our one-night stay. The concierge was very friendly and helpful. They recommended places to eat for both lunch and dinner. They were right on with their recommendations - both were amazing places to eat! We enjoyed our comfortable yet trendy room and the hotel was great for shopping on State Street, Michigan Avenue and also close to the river. My husband and I also enjoyed the lounge and a free drink from the hotel. This is one of the only hotels that I saw that still has a continental breakfast - it was fresh and just what you needed to start your day. Thanks for a great stay!", 
    "I have nothing bad to say. I loved how modern the room was. Plenty of room for 2 people.", 
    "Great location and convenient to shopping and restruants / clubs. Room was very clean but a bit small. Bathroom was average. ", 
    "Nice experience. Room comfortable, well maintained, staff considerate and attentive. Renovation is nice although I am suspicious that some \"issues\" may be wearing masks! Caught the distinct smell of sewage on a couple of occasions. When the guest in the next room closed their shades it sounded like they were actually in my room. Gave me a start the first time I heard it. The lobby needs some work, brightened up, and the heavy floral smell is a bit overwhelming. Be prepared for street noise. Usually stay in larger hotels so on a higher floor thus busy streets not as noticeable. Kinzie is small so there were times I felt like I was in the middle of all that noise. ", 
    "Clean and new building - a bit taken aback that it was only 6 floors - based on the pictures, seems like a tall building. Otherwise, goo experience overall. ", 
    "The Breakfast tables set out on each floor were well above average and we liked each item that we tried.", 
    "The hotel staff was great. Room was nice would have preferred a higher floor, on 2nd floor, but very clean and spacious. In walking distance to attractions. Continental breakfast ok but would prefer something hot. Loved the free evening drink. Would recommend to others but would probably not come again.", 
    "Excellent staff! Extremely accommodating many times they went out of their way for guests....ordering dinner for take in, reservations, shows..... Close to the finish/start for the marathon. Awesome location within walking distance to most attractions. Bonus breakfast and WIFI included, happy hour and appetizers! Thanks Kinzie!", 
    "Wonderful hotel. Clean, comfortable, excellent customer service ! One of my favorite places to stay . Nice evening reception and daily breakfast. Highly recommend", 
    "Incredible re-model! Clean aesthetics, functional furnishings, technology support, superb staff, quiet rooms, and of course, the well stocked happy hour and breakfasts. Well done! (Although, I do miss the Amalfi's \"wave wall\"...) :)", 
    "awesome hotel - love the free breakfast and the rooms are pretty. Front desk staff wasn't super friendly, but the door man was!! :) Would certainly stay her again.", 
    "A wonderful hotel all around. Modern, casual, and newly updated. Lobby and check-in are small and informal - very efficient and friendly. Views can be hard to come by, as the hotel only occupies the first 6 floors of the building. The room was great - modern, clean, super comfortable king bed, and the H20 bath products are a great touch. The continental breakfast is great - there's one on every floor, and the room comes with a serving tray, which made for a great leisurely private brunch before noon checkout. The rooms have mini refrigerators...keep a bottle of champagne overnight and make mimosas in the morning!", 
    "Had an awesome time in Chicago loved the hotel and staff very friendly and friendly. ", 
    "Was in Chicago on business, Kinzie was close to office I was visiting. Had a good stay.", 
    "We had booked a 3 night stay at this hotel. After one night, we left and stayed at a different, cheaper and much better hotel. The room was facing a building that was so close that wee could not keep the shades open as we would have had absolutely no privacy. The shower would not drain at all, we had water up to our ankle within 2 minutes. There was a terrible patch work done in the ceiling of the bathroom. The beds were not really comfortable either. I am shocked they would call this a Luxury room. In the lobby, they tried to make the door of the office look like modern wood. To do so, they used paper that they glued. It could almost fool you until you see the paper falling off from the top. They poorly tried to renovate an old building by going the cheap route yet make you pay highly for it.", 
    "Everyone there was wonderful! The room was beautiful and the view was amazing. Meg was wonderful at the front desk. Thanks for an Amazing night", 
    "While I had seen some reviews mentioning the noise in the neighborhood I didn't think it would be that bad and we were just staying one night. Boy was I wrong. We attended an event just across the Chicago River so we were able to walk there which was very convenient.. The noise coming from within the hotel was so-so. Our room was located across the hall from some employee room (I saw inside it one time while someone was coming out) It looked like where they have supplies etc. and stuff for breakfast which they serve on each floor next to the elevators) so there was a lot of door opening and closing just across from us which was mildly annoying. However, the nightclubs just next to and behind the hotel were playing loud live music until 4:30 a.m.!! It was really really loud, and sadly I know it is not the fault of the hotel, but I used to live in Chicago in a noisy area and we ended up buying sound blocking drapes which really helped, and which I think the Kinzie should too. The staff was nice and apologetic in the morning when I mentioned how noisy and late the noise was, but I won't return there unless they can provide better sound insulation.", 
    "Walking distance to anything you want. . Don't get a cab!! Download the lyft App!!!", 
    "Loved this hotel, very well positioned for most of the major attractions in Chicago. Staff were wonderful, the room was amazing, really clean and the best bathroom towels going. The breakfast was really good and you can have as much as you like, with fresh juices, coffee etc and plenty of choices of food. The free evening drinks was a really good idea. We felt totally looked after all the time we were there.", 
    "Great service. Checked us in early. Fixed any issues promptly. Room was good size and clean. Good location.", 
    "First visit to Chicago. Great flight. Blue line train into central Chicago. Hotel a short walk from train. Wonderful tourists attractions, tons to see and enjoy. Fabulous restaurants. Can't wait to return.", 
    "Modern hotel rooms with sleek contemporary furniture. Very clean. Comfortable bed.Located near shops,restaurants and boat tour launches.", 
    "My stay was great . Clean place with modern amenities. Located downtown next to some great local taverns .", 
    "Nice, not overly spacious double room; lots of street noise. Nice cocktail reception and very convenient continental breakfast on each floor (so, no standing in line). Hard to find a place for 4 of us to eat it in our room, however. One barstool, a window seat and that's it. But the location (just north of the river, a few blocks from Michigan Ave, not far from Art Institute, Theatre District, okay walk to Magnificent Mile) made it a good pick. No restaurant on site, but several within a block in any direction. Harry Caray's across the street, House of Blues a block away. Overall, a very nice and comfortable hotel.", 
    "This hotel is great! Staff couldn't do enough to make your stay enjoyable. Great location, close to Magnificent Mile. Navy Pier only a 20 minute walk. Breakfast buffet was nice and handy, had lots of selection. Free cocktails on 6th floor was great!!!!!! Definitely would go back!!!!", 
    "Crazy expensive parking, paid $ 56 per night ,so it ended up really high. But location of the hotel great, walking distance anywhere, everywhere, Rooms are very modern, nice, clean.", 
    "The hotel was in a great location north of the river. Lots of night life and shopping within walking distance. The hotel was very \"modern\". The bed was comfortable, but for the expensive price of a hotel it felt a little lacking. No restaurant or bar, other than a small converted room that they turned in to a cocktail space from 5-8. Minimum bar service - basically just two hotel employees making basic drinks. Also disappointed that I paid such a high price for a hotel and still had to pay over $50 per night in parking. Breakfast was good, lots of choices. I also liked that it lasted until 10/11 am. I hate having to get up early on vacation just to make it on time to breakfast. Lastly, staff was kind but stiff. This hotel was \"nice\" but I feel it was overpriced for what it is.", 
    "On my last night at the kinzie while writing this. I book this hotel because it was the best value on Expedia. I made a great choice. They did a great job at renovating and making it modern. The staff is very helpful and polite. Beds are very comfy and room is spacious. The continental breakfast has a decent selection, however first two mornings there was no coffee left but after talking to the staff they quickly sent a fresh pot to my room. There is also a Kurieg in the room. I'm sure this is the same at any hotel but it can tend to be noisy outside as Chicago drivers seem to love honking their horn any chance they get. The staff will go out of their way to book dinner or attractions for you and give great recommendations. Btw... The subway is only couple blocks away North or south as your right on the red line. Rest of the lines just north. I would absolutely come back again and hope this hotel becomes more popular. The way a hotel should be. ", 
    "The family enjoyed, we wished they have a swimming pool", 
    "This hotel is great for its location but the staff is extremely noisy! Every morning between 5 and 8 the maids shout at each other across the corridors slam carts and doors , shout out loud ..Impossible to get a good sleep. Even when asked to keep it quiet. Very disappointed.", 
    "Everything about the hotel was great. A little picky thing: They should have some sheer blinds on the windows because one can be seen from the street or nearby building especially on the lower levels if the blinds are open. Otherwise, would stay there again for sure.", 
    "Staff was exceptionally helpful with our request for a late check out and bag storage. Location was excellent:3 block walk to the L which made for a quick, easy trip to Wrigley Field; easy walk to everywhere else we wanted to visit.", 
    "Terrific city lots to see and do!The river cruises are wonderful and going up the Willis tower is great.The waterfront is beautiful.", 
    "We arrived several hours before check-in with our luggage. We were hoping to stow our luggage until check-in time, but they happily checked us into our room early. All desk personnel were always cheerful, eager to assist, and very helpful with restaurant and entertainment recommendations. The room was elegantly furnished and clean. The location was great, within walking distance of many attractions and the \"L.\" We highly recommend this hotel.", 
    "clean hotel, great location, friendly staff but staff made a few mistakes", 
    "Staff is great; very helpful. Room was clean and beds were comfortable. Having a free breakfast buffet in the a.m. was sooooooo convenient as I am not a morning person to get up early to go out to eat. Free happy hour also a huge perk as there is no on site bar. But not to worry, there a several GREAT places on the same block. Public House next store as great food and Harry Carey's across the street has good burgers. Also Bar 51 around the corner has a good happy hour. But the BEST part is the location. Can't beat it . Walked everywhere we went, even down to the Aquarium. Will def stay there again! Safe Travels!!", 
    "Nice breakfast was provided every morning. It was set up in front of elevators on each floor. Rooms were nicely decorated. Staff in front office were helpful.", 
    "I booked it last minute at a great price, especially for downtown Chicago. Everything seemed pretty new, the staff was very friendly and the room was quiet.", 
    "the pictures on the web site lead you to believe that there is an awesome view, this is not the case. the room are small but very clean and updated. would stay again but would have to be at a discounted price.", 
    "Came here to stay after concert. Super clean, very friendly staff, hip, great location. Very quiet for being downtown. Great blinds that blocked a lot of light out.", 
    "We were here for one night. Room was very clean and comfortable. Continental breakfast provided on each floor so you can take back to your room. Great location, close to shopping, restaurants. Bell staff was very helpful.", 
    "Great hotel in great location close to everything and great restaurants, staff excellent hotel newly renovated", 
    "This hotel was outstanding! Aside from the incredible location, cleanliness, fantastic breakfast & Happy hour, Kidzie Hotel's employees made this one of the Best experiences I have had in a very long time. Everyone was friendly and made us feel like they went out of their way just for us! Megan at the front desk was so helpful on recommendations. She even helped with my dog Oreo when he got a bit too \"talkative\" in the room while we were at dinner. I would highly recommend this Hotel & can't wait to go back soon!!", 
    "I would definitely go back to the Kinzie!", 
    "The room was super clean. The bed linens were crisp and clean. The towels were huge and comfy. Managers reception every night with drinks and horderves. Get there early, plenty drink but the food went fast. Yummy cookies. Helpful staff for the hotel and suggestions for site seeing. It was a relaxing atmosphere after a long days of touring. ", 
    "Very nice modern hotel. Close to everything... mag mile, millennium park, downtown, river, lake. Great staff, very helpful. Would recommend to anyone. Stayed during Lollapolooza, no noise, amazing. Breakfast on each floor is so convenient. ", 
    "The hotel is centrally located with the Pier, the Magnificent mile, the Loop, etc! Great location! ", 
    "Enjoyed my stay. Friendly and knowledgeable staff. Comfortable clean room. ", 
    "Very nice staff. Walking distance to most activities. Would stay again if visiting Chicago.", 
    "We had to change rooms after the first night of our three day stay because of the noise outside of the hotel in the street. There was extremely loud screaming in the middle of the night. The staff was responsive and did move us to a room facing the back. We really enjoyed this hotel's breakfast. It was a very nice continental breakfast available on every floor. Each room was equipped with a cute tray to bring breakfast back to the room. It was convenient and relaxing.", 
    "The hotel was a pleasant surprise and he staff were very friendly. The hotel was well kept and the rooms were clean and newly decorated. At check in were were given 2 drink tokens each for happy hour, we stayed 2 nights, which we used the first night as we had plans for the second night. The continental breakfast was included and was placed in the lobby on each floor. Both days we had a late start but the breakfast was still well stocked and there was a great variety of items to choose from. There is a tray in the room so you can load it up and take it to your room.", 
    "There are only two things about the Kinzie that I can say that are not positive. First, the pillows are not very comfortable, so bring your own from home. And the free breakfast is in my opinion not good. It is mainly donuts, pastries, sweetened yogurt and bread. There were boiled eggs and string cheese, but other than that it was very sugary. We opted to go down the street to eat at the very awesome restaurant: Lyfe Kitchen. I know lots of folks love donuts....but not my family. We prefer something a bit more healthy.", 
    "Room was very comfortable and centrally located for where I had to be for a conference and dinner. I'm not sure if it was because I was overly tired but, the bed was so comfortable and the staff exceptionally friendly. The hotel was really easy to get to as I took the train from ORD and walked a couple of blocks to the hotel.", 
    "The Kinzie is a wonderful hotel in the heart of Chicago within walking distance to everything. Best continental breakfast buffet I have ever experienced provided on each floor. Room and bathroom were spacious and very clean. Nothing negative to say at all. Very much enjoyed our stay and would stay there again.", 
    "Overall great experience. The staff is so friendly and helpful! The room is clean and pretty and breakfast on every floor is awesome.", 
    "We were there for less than 24 hours, but our experience was outstanding. Valet and bellman were great. We enjoyed the complimentary cocktail at happy hour, and the continental breakfast the next morning was outstanding (we absolutely loved the fact that it was outside the elevators on our floor which meant we could grab what we wanted and enjoy it in the room...huge bonus!). The gym was just \"okay,\" but the location was outstanding with plenty of shopping, eating and drinking within close walking distance. We would definitely stay here again.", 
    "Had a great stay and especially loved the breakfast on each floor in the morning.", 
    "You couldn't ask for a better location. Easy to walk to so many Chicago attractions, and if you are not a walker, your trains are all within a few blocks. The staff at the Kinzie are sincere in wanting you to enjoy your stay. It's so nice to be able to walk down the hall for breakfast (even in your robe), and the evening reception is a fun place to mingle.", 
    "Across from Harry Carey s & walk to Shaw s My two fav rest in chicago. Staff was friendly & helpful. Clean fresh roms with plenty of towels Not much lobby but what do you need it for?", 
    "Staff made us feel so very welcome. Very accomodating and always smiling. Rooms were ready early with a choice. Continental breakfast was perfect on each floor so there was enough for all. Meeting other guests to chat over a cocktail was super in the lounge after a long hot day of sightseeing, we got to compare notes of our travels. Rafi (I hope that's your name?) at the concierge desk was so attentive and nice, as was the evening concierge. Will be returning again and again to the Kinzie!", 
    "Parking was much more than expected. $31 for less than 8 hours of self-parking was steep. The hotel offered valet parking for $56. Had we known how much parking would have cost we may have chosen an alternate hotel.", 
    "My wife and I flew into Chicago early on the 4th of July and were worried on what to do with our luggage. Contacted the hotel and they said they would store our bags and when we did arrive they actually had our room ready hours before check in. This was done so without me even having to ask. From start to finish of our stay was fantastic. Great hospitality, service and excellent location. Nice breakfast and a cocktail hour to boot. Usually don't take time to rate hotels but this one earned it", 
    "Generous hospitality. No skimping. Great free breakfast and cocktail hour! Lovely room and very clean. Very nice free toiletries. Staff friendly and helpful. Nothing was too much trouble. Great location. Fabulous stay and one of my best hotel stays ever. ", 
    "We had a great stay at the Kinzie. The breakfast was great. The rooms are larger than most downtown hotels and very comfortable. We loved having the breakfast on each floor and it was a very good breakfast. The exercise room is small, but well equipped.", 
    "Excellent hotel, clean and comfortable. Hotel staff was great.", 
    "Have stayed here many times when the hotel was the Amalfi, still a great place to stay although the hotel complimentary cocktail was better previously. Excellent location, would highly recommend!", 
    "Really enjoyed the excellent location of the hotel, within walking distance of many of the major tourist attactions. Having a continental breakfast on each floor of the hotel worked out well. The free cocktail and appetizers were a nice touch. The hotel was clean, staff were friendly, had a great stay. Would certainly recommend this hotel.", 
    "very good! good location! We would book there again.", 
    "Stayed here with friends for 3 nights. The hotel is located in a perfect spot for visiting the city. Staff were very friendly and accommodating. Continental breakfast served on each floor was much more than the usual and very good. Evening appetizers & drinks (5-8 pm) were beyond our expectations!", 
    "One of the better hotels I have stayed at. Comfortable room, breakfast on each floor (like breakfast in bed), snacks and drinks in the afternoon is all someone could want from a hotel.", 
    "Located within walking distance to many activities, michigan ave shopping, theaters, etc. Small lobby area but rooms were clean", 
    "Had a great stay at the Kinzie. Very comfortable, lovely robes, nice inclusive breakfast and cocktails. Location was excellent...overall perfect stay!", 
    "Great staff and great room! Love the Double Cross lounge for enjoying a few drinks before hitting the town. Great continental breakfast. No complaints except I wish there was a pool.", 
    "When unwrapping a cloth found it was stained and dirty...not sure the cleaning staff is as meticulous as the rest of staff. Breakfast was great . The appetizers were the same each night so a variety would be nice. Bell hops and door men were amazing and very helpful. We would stay here again when in Chicago.", 
    "Great location, step away to Chicago river, convinence to everywhere you want to go. Take train from Airport to hotel, fast and worry-free. Very clean and comfortable room, breakfast included. We are so happy to choose Kinzie Hotel. ", 
    "This was a great hotel. The staff was great and very helpful with tips on where to go and places to see and eat. The continental breakfast is a nice touch plus a nice happy hour room. We would definitely come back here and stay it was wonderful", 
    "Short and simple. Wonderful!! I could not have asked for a better place!", 
    "My husband & I have stayed at several Chicago hotels & this is one of the best. Rooms are clean, nice amenities, the continental breakfast on each floor is wonderful. We also went to the manager's reception & great apps along with good cocktails. We arrived early & they did not hesitate to check us in & it was very quick. Can't beat the location, close to some great bars, food, highly recommend to stay here!", 
    "walking distance to most sites, shopping, restaurants, bars and tours or a short cab ride. Convenient continental breakfast on each floor outside elevator - just grab your tray in your room and have breakfast in your room. Only 6 floors of hotel rooms and the rest office - therefore no long waits for the elevator. Not the greatest view - roof of an old building straight our our huge picturesque windows but if you looked up you could see the skyscrapers . No restaurant - but free drink and appetizers everynight on the 6th floor. A small gym but no pool and it was HOT in Chicago - would have loved a pool either indoor or out.", 
    "Spent 3 nights here in a corner suite and really enjoyed my stay. Staff was very helpful in recommending activities, restaurants, and booking tours. ", 
    "This was a truly wonderful stay. The staff was friendly and attentive to our needs. They went above and beyond our expectations. The property is beautiful, comfortable, and well-located.", 
    "Ultra clean hotel with a very fun, chic decor. The room was extremely clean with very comfortable bedding. Free wifi and free breakfast served on each floor. The staff was very helpful and polite. An overall excellent experience.", 
    "My grandchildren loved the showers and the views. We enjoyed walking or taking a water taxi to places of interest. ", 
    "Both the room and bathroom were comfortable in size with four of us.", 
    "My room smelled like urine it was nothing like the picture on hotels.com I came from out of town expecting a luxury hotel.", 
    "My husband and I spent the weekend there and had a great time. The breakfast was good and very convenient. Everybody on the staff was very friendly and helpful.", 
    "Staff was extremely friendly.", 
    "overall, wonderful. pros: location, fitness center, managers reception, updated property con: room with view of vacant lot", 
    "This is a small, modern and clean hotel just off State Street one block from the Chicago River. The Trump Tower and Marina City are close by. The Grand Red Line subway station or Merchandise Mart \"L\" stations are not far. It is a nice walk to the Loop and Magnificent Mile. There is a free trolley to Navy Pier where there was a great fireworks show on Saturday night. There are lots of restaurants close by. The Weber Grill on State St. is good. Check out the Oak Street Beach and Oak Street shopping. Take the bus to Coal Fire Pizza. Take the Red Line to Wriggly Field for a tour and to see the Million Dollar Quartet on Lincoln Ave. The breakfast on each floor was nice. There is a refrigerator and safe in the room. The staff was friendly. We would definitely stay here again. ", 
    "Everyone at hotel was top notch! Friendly and helpful. Had a great time.", 
    "i staied in this hotel several time. everything is helping to enjoy the stay. i particualrly like its location, friendly and helpful staff and clean spacious rooms. i am sure that i will sty again and again whenever i stop in Chicago.", 
    "This hotel is incredible. From the moment you step in, they think of anything you need. A cocktail on the house every evening along with hors d'oevres, fruit infused water with chocolate chip cookies and the continental breakfast on every floor - you are treated like royalty! I wish I would have brought my workout gear - the gym has all the equipment you will need. And they are pet friendly making you feel like you are home with your pup. I will be back when I visit Chicago for pleasure!", 
    "Felt very welcomed by staff. Hotel was chic, and in a great location. Very clean and comfortable", 
    "Good hotel close to mag mile and river. Well presented and did me fine.", 
    "I called the hotel to ask about pets and the lady had an attitude; when we arrived, the staff was friendly including housekeeping on the 6th floor. Continental breakfast was good each morning; nothing like resorts but it has your basic options. Our view was nice; location was awesome! The room was clean and comfortable; my only complaint is the white robe they provided had yellowish stains all over it and I didn't notice until I put it on and I wanted to vomit.", 
    "I love this hotel!! The staff is always very knowledgeable, helpful, and courteous, from front desk staff (where you get to take a seat to check in!) to room service to housekeeping. When I wanted to order a deep dish (not offered through room service), the gentleman at the front desk rushed up a menu to his local favorite joint. The room was extremely comfortable, from the bedding to the additional furniture, such as the settee next to the window. I will always stay at the Kinzie.", 
    "Great location, wonderful staff! The Happy Hour is a definite bonus! Would stay here again!", 
    "I would recommend this hotel as it is excellent for the price. Rooms are clean , staff friendly , and location is perfect,, not what I consider luxury but very good for business if you not spending too much time in your room. Not good restaurants or bars in the place but with its location why would you need that.. Best things is the complementary breakfast served on your floor ,, great idea and very very convienent .", 
    "Excellent location and impressive service make this a \"must stay.\" Will be back again.", 
    "Super load! And someone tried to open my door at 7am...thankfully I had the latch locked.", 
    "Hotel is just off the Magnificent Mile - Central to all Chicago Attractions.", 
    "Thoroughy enjoyed our weekend at Kinzie. Located in a great location in River North. Great staff - friendly. No complaints at all.", 
    "We stayed at a Westin hotel a few days before moving to this hotel. We found the overall quality to be lower than a Westin hotel. The location was great, the staff were friendly, and the hotel had a nice feel to it. However, the overall feel was inferior to a Westin brand, including cleanliness, quality of bed, towels, etc.", 
    "Loved the hotel!!!! Good location, staff very friendly ! Only thing was amenities priced a little high, but that is all over! I would definitely come & stay there again!!!", 
    "Friendly staff, the young guy at reception always had a welcoming smile. Room was excellent, great size with lovely big windows. Perhaps the option of some voile to pull across window for a little more privacy may be preferable for some thou, rather than having to block out the light by pulling the blinds down. The complimentary breakfast was spot on and was amazed to find gluten free cereal which is rarely on a buffet breakfast which you have to pay for, we'll done!! Great location, got the train from the airport and the stop was only a couple of blocks from the hotel. If returning to Chicago I wouldn't hesitate to book this hotel again. Keep up the good work!!", 
    "I checked into the Kinzie for the Sweets and Snacks Expo that was going on that week. Upon my first step into the hotel, I knew something was wrong the night desk manager, gave me a solemn glance. ( i knew something was wrong) he asked, are you Mr. H? I responded why YES! yes I am. the next few minutes were a whirlwind of information. but at the end of it. I had no room. They had overbooked my room. But to credit of the hotel and its staff, they went above and beyond in trying to make this right.( they gave me the room the following two nights & comped one of the nights as well) I credit the hotel staff in making a terrible situation bearable and going out of there way to make up for the mistake. I would stay at this hotel again, solely for the high level of customer service provided. the rooms themselves were great, the beds comfortable. The hotel is centrally located near restaurants and the booming night scene. The hotel lobby could use some work, but the rooms themselves compare to the W's. where I normally stay. Jake especially was great at handling all of this. He is someone that should be given a raise & promotion for how he expertly handled a difficult situation.", 
    "I loved the snack buffet every night, the breakfast buffet was good too, it was just missing eggs, bacon, fruit salad and hot chocolate. I kind of like the fact that you can grab your food and eat in your room, but it's not convenient when you are a big group. The room was good, but the rolling shower not that great. Room was clean, they had a mini fridge were you could store food and drinks which is great. The service was great, we had to deal with great and understandable people. The location is also great, close to the loop and navy pier, it's really central. I will definitely come back.", 
    "The staff was spectacular. They were extremely knowledgeable of the area restaurants, sights, and the subway system. There was a breakfast each morning that consisted of various pastries and a cocktail social in the evening that included drinks and food. The food consisted of meats and cheeses with toasts among other things. It was perfect to go with a glass of wine or cocktail before heading out to dinner. I almost always stay at higher end hotels, so I've slept in many comfortable hotel beds before. This one was no exception. It may have even been the most comfortable bed I've ever slept in at a hotel. The hotel is conveniently located close to the subway and is within walking distance (1 - 1.5 miles) of plenty attractions. I tend to enjoy walking when I visit cities. I feel as though I get to see more that way. The Chicago Symphony Center, Millennium Park, plenty of restaurants, and shopping along Magnificent Mile are all within a 15-30 minute walk. If you'd rather take the subway, there is a station two blocks away that can get you to any of those places within a few minutes for $10/day unlimited riding. My next trip to Chicago will most likely include a stay at the Kinzie Hotel.", 
    "Enjoyed the hotel and the great location to local hot spots", 
    "To stayed in the corner room. It was ok not as good as they hyped it up to be. But the staff was nice and friendly", 
    "This is a great hotel - close to everything without an outrageous price tag. The rooms have all been nicely renovated and overall, it has a nice feel to it. Check in was a little chaotic but we were able to get into our room early, though we sacrificed room size to do so. My only true complaint was that housekeeping cleaned my room while I was away, and threw away a large bag of homemade cookies I had brought along for my Chicago friends. Not sure if they thought I had checked out already or what, but it was a disappointment!", 
    "Great hotel perfect location, was impressed with how helpful and courteous the staff was, will definitely be back when vacationing in Chicago again.", 
    "Exceptional Service! Very friendly and helpful staff. Everyone went above and beyond to make our stay fantastic, from the door greeter to the concierge! Perfect location to see downtown Chicago! Nice, clean and comfortable room! Beds were very comfortable, slept well! Loved having a complimentary breakfast located on each floor! Delicious options! Also enjoyed the nightly reception with appetizers and soft drinks! Highly recommend this hotel!! Offered 3 different free newspapers every day we were there. Nice fitness center! I give the Kinzie an A+!!", 
    "Clean and inviting, in great location. Try to get a higher floor, as noise level from street was a bit loud in second floor room."

    "It was nice to be in a hotel that has been renovated and updated with spacious rooms and in the heart of downtown Chicago. Well within walking distance for the School of the Art Institute's commencement exercises as well as the Art Institute itself.", 
    "I do t think I will be staying there again it was terrible and over crowded and the staff was confused and the front desk was real rude ", 
    "The staff was just excellent! The room had a pretty lumpy bed and the bathroom was dirty but I enjoyed the staff tremendously and I would go back.", 
    "We checked in on Thursday May 14, 2015. We had separate reservations for 2 nights. We discussed with this with the clerk upon checking in and were assured that everything would be seamless. Well, it was not. After a full day on Friday, we were unable to get our keys to work( a problem with the 2 reservations which we had been told would not be a problem) and then found that house-keeping had not cleaned the room. They offered to clean the room (at 9 pm), we declined and 20 minutes later clean towels were brought to us. The room was stuffy. small and old. My wife would only shower, not bathe, due to the condition of the bath tub. Finally, we were half way to Midway airport upon our departure on Saturday the 16th, when we realized that the Bell desk had not given us all our belongings. Bottom line...this hotel is over-priced and, while very attractive in the public areas, is not a place I would recommend.", 
    "Perfect....Nice in everything. Good staff. Great environment. I had an awesome experience.", 
    "Good location, noisy room. The location is great but the room was just so so. It was pleasant enough, but I could hear the people on all sides. And we had a leaky bathtub during the night which forced me to put washcloths underneath the drips because I couldn't make it stop.", 
    "Perfect , clean , organized and spacious room. Nice location, easy reach & access to Michigan Ave. Close to Art Museum. ", 
    "First trip to Chicago and the hotel staff were very helpful! Great location and friendly staff! Will definitely stay again!",

    "Great location. Nice lobby. Rooms are updated, very clean and comfortable. Overall a great experience. I will stay there again. ", 
    "Front desk staff were probably overworked with a lot of guests attending a convention.... but it's a big hotel & they should be happy with the business right? NO! They were obviously overwhelmed and lacked patience to attend to customer's needs. They were inpatient on the phone & sarcastic, & in person refused to help at all. One week of our stay in this pricey but not so fancy hotel was saved by the housekeepers on the 18th floor! They were gracious sweet & funny, God bless them!", 
    "Amazing lobby, large comfortable lovely room, efficient and professional staff. Special commendation to Miguel, the warm and welcoming bellman who greets you at the entrance of the hotel.", 
    "We only wanted a room for a brief nights sleep after a late evening in the city. Towards that end it was fine. We got a great rate through Expedia at a price that was about 1/3 the normal rate. Even at that rate though, we were disappointed with the overall experience. The room was small, but the bathroom was really tiny with little counter space for toiletries one would normally travel with. The room design was tight- you couldn't open both the closet and bathroom door at the same time and while easy to navigate around that, it was odd. Once we actually got checked into our room about 4:30 pm we noticed there were 2 large bags of dirty laundry directly outside our door and across the hall was another room's discarded room service dishes. We didn't think that much of it when arriving, but was surprised to see it there when we returned after midnight and again the next morning when we checked out about 10:30 am...seems like they have a housekeeping issue. When we arrived the room wasn't ready (we were early so no big deal), but told we could check in early for an additional $25 (seemed odd to upcharge if there were rooms available). We declined and were told we could check our bags at the bellstand down a level for no charge. When we went down a level, we waited in line at the bellstand, only to be told that was just for retrieving bags, not checking them. We were redirected down a hall where another line was waiting. Overall, the Hotel lacked a guest experience focus", 
    "Hotel rooms are old and tired. Very noisy as it is close to el trains", 
    "Quick stay, but will keep on my list! Comfortable room, good breakfast in hotel restaurant. Above average in all categories, with an absolutely stunning lobby. The ceilings alone are worth 5 stars!",

    "Nice lobby. The room was spacious. Staff was friendly. Overall, good impression.",

    "Grand hotel, gorgeous lobby, nice staff. Room was clean and roomy for an older hotel, but stains on ottoman were ugly. Noise from room above was loud enough to wake us, sounded like a tumbling team. Even with those two demerits, would recommend this hotel for location and ambiance. TIP- use Park Whiz and save about $25 on self-parking, or just ride the train, it has a stop beside the hotel.", 
    "We stayed here as it was close to the Bank of America theater. I am a Hilton Honors member. also.", 
    "The room was clean and her comfortable... Room service was quick and yummy!! Awesome stay!!!", 
    "We've been at the Palmer House several times and always have a good experience.", 
    "I booked this hotel over the phone through Expedia and received excellent customer service. I booked Congress Hotel nearby Palmer Hotel and read reviews online that Congress Hotel was haunted. I immediately called Expedia and request to book Palmer Hotel instead. It was probably the best decision I made on this trip because this location is near everything I wanted to see. I watched the Book of Mormon at Bank of America Theatre which is a block away from the hotel. ", 
    "Good, very very slow elevators. Long waits to come and go, otherwise good. ", 
    "In Chicago for a weekend, I needed quick access to the Art Institute and chose this place. Its historic character and relatively good price also appealed to me.", 
    "The Palmer house is an historic hotel that offers excellent service and amenities. The staff was always helpful and always had a smile. I was also fortunate enough to have great weather while I was in Chicago. The staff was helpful with suggestions for great local food choices and other activities. The room was surprisingly small but when you take into consideration the age and the history that goes with this property, I guess it is understandable. Another fun fact would be the trivia questions that can be seen while riding the elevator or on the menu section on the televisions. The great history of the property jumps out at you as you read all of these interesting tid bits about the famous people that stayed at this property over its amazing history. One more thing about the staff. I must say they have to be one of the friendliest group of people I have ever encountered while staying at a hotel. Not only did they always have a smile but they always had a kind word of two to share. One situation that stands out was on the day of my departure. i was leaving the room with my luggage and one of the employees sees me and says, \"why are you leaving us?\". I felt more like a family friend than a stranger staying in a hotel. I thought to myself, I'm going to use that in my job. It really made my day. What a great property with a great staff. The location ain't bad either. Right in the middle of downtown Chicago. A short walk from all sorts of entertainment. A stay will be enjoyed!!!", 
    "Great location, good facility and echos of the past.", 
    "We absolutely loved this hotel. It is a really neat hotel to begin with, with lots of character, but still clean, fresh, and well maintained. It is also in an excellent location. We were within a couple minutes walk from Millenium Park, The Art Institute of Chicago, as well as lots and lots of restaurants. ", 
    "I see a lot of people and torus cars high rise historical buildings.", 
    "Best hotel experience in Chicago yet. Easy check in, nice room, comfortable and quiet. Love the Merlot in the lobby, could have just stayed there. They checked our bicycles for free, awesome place to walk to the Lake Shore bike path then ride. Be sure to visit the Chicago History Museum up by Lincoln Park, you really get to learn about the City. Tesori across the street, great place to eat as is Hackneys a few blocks south. Parking is a bit of an issue...but that's Chicago for ya'. The highlight of the trip though, was talking with Ed Asner in the lobby. Great guy !", 
    "very clean hotel,near of the metro,excellent service ", 
    "Great hotel. Wonderful staff. I would definitely stay there again. ", 
    "We really enjoyed our stay at the Palmer House. The art and room fixtures were exquisite. It portrayed an ambience of class, intellectual energy and creativity. We experienced Chicago without actually needing to leave the hotel once the sun had set. ", 
    "Close to Chicago Art Museum, Symphony Center, Russian Tea Room, and Millenium Park! Comfortable beds with pristine cotton sheets made sleeping easy. The windows open and provide fresh air in addition to fine views including low clouds during our stay. Pleasant staff will store your bags before check in and after check out so you have more time to enjoy the city unencumbered. Having Mertz Pharmacy in the complex is very enjoyable. We plan on returning to The Palmer House.", 
    "We really enjoyed our stay at The Palmer House and found it close to many downtown amenities, including shopping, restaurants, transportation and activities. Union Station was relatively close and the day was nice enough to walk to the hotel. If you don't want to walk, bus stops are close as are many taxi's ready to take you to wherever you desire to go. We were also just a block or so away from Michigan Ave. and had the weather been nicer we could have walked to most everywhere. A 15 minute taxi ride got us to the Museum campus including Shedd Aquarium and the The Field Museum. We easily walked to Millennium Park(The Bean) as well as the restaurants that we ate dinner at. For breakfast, we bought the room package that included the breakfast buffet, and we left full both days with a variety of food that made all 4 of us happy! The staff was very pleasant and welcoming, and while the bathrooms were on the small side (this is an old hotel!), the room was very comfortable and roomy. The beds were kind of tight, with 2 people per 2 full size beds, so I would recommend upgrading to a larger bed if possible. Also, if you want a room with the lake view, be forewarned that the \"L\" is right below, and if you're a light sleeper (as I am ) you may still hear it on the 23rd floor. Overall, though, we had a great experience and will be back again!", 
    "The Palmer House Hilton is a very nice hotel and in a great location in Chicago. Easy walking distance to many restaurants and attractions. ", 
    "Everything we hoped for and more with an unsolicited upgrade. Walking distance to theaters, restaurants and shopping.", 
    " Very nice staff. I will be visiting again soon. Loved that they had event going on it made the hotel seem like one big get together. Loved it! ", 
    "Everything was great with the exception of the extremely expensive breakfast buffet. It was ordinary, but priced as if it was the best in the country.", 
    "Really liked the 2 bathrooms in the room and the cable channel selection for the kids. My only complaint was the pool was too cold. ", 
    "The hotel is a great place to stay as long as you get good hotel neighbors. I called the front desk twice to ask for someone to help remedy the very long guests. After a half hour (past midnight) the noice was reduced. Disappointed that we did not get a good nights sleep but the accommodations were fine. Can't really say too much about the staff on duty that night though.", 
    "The hotel was just steps away from a ton of shopping and entertainment. The first room that we were placed in wasn't cleaned thoroughly and had stuff splashed on the walls in various parts of the room. However they were able to get us moved to another room within minutes, although the other room was a tad smaller. Overall I would stay there again ", 
    "The Palmer House is an old fashioned grand hotel with all the pluses and minuses that go with that. Everything you can think of is available in the hotel, but not so much in the rooms. There is no coffee maker, iron, or mini-fridge in the rooms. WiFi in room is expensive. With the exception of ice all other amenities are on the ground and lobby floors and not on the individual hotel floors. However, concierge is very helpful; the computer center with computers, internet and printer is free and uncrowded; luggage storage is free. The restaurant quite nice and not overly crowded. All of the staff are friendly, knowledgeable, and helpful. The art deco room decor and the Victorian decoration elsewhere is charming. The Lobby ceiling is spectacular. The hotel is perfectly placed for Chicago touristing just one block from the Art Institute and right on the metra.", 
    "My kids and I really enjoyed the hotel from the time we checked in to the time it was time to check out. Parking was great to be in Chicago. The staff was awesome. My kids really enjoyed the pool and the time it was opened. The food at the restaurant was great! I would recommend it to all my friends and family. The history that is there to, is awesome. Loved it!", 
    "Everything the description said it would be. Thumbs up!", 
    "The hotel is beautiful but the rooms are very small.", 
    "Beautiful and historic just what I was looking for. Very nice rooms.", 
    "Has been many years ago that I had been there and had no idea that they had remodeled. Such a memory builder that I hope to revisit soon. ", 
    "Hotel was gorgeous! But we were surprised at how small the room was. Paid only $159/night but regular price is $344/night that's crazy!! Hotel is so centrally located. The bus and parking garage is very close and really the Palmer house is quite prestigious... Our room was across from the elevator and was a lot noisier than anyone would have liked (at ALL hours too! ) All and all it was a nice hotel and room but I wouldn't have stayed if not for the great deal I'd gotten. ", 
    "Staying in Chicago for an overnight and wanted something in the theater district. This was well worth the stay! The interior of the lobby is beautiful. I had limited interaction with the staff but all were courteous and professional. The room I booked was somewhat small, but it was still clean and comfortable. ", 
    "great. I'd stay there again and again and again. Best place to stay for access to just about everything", 
    "As always the hotel was as expected, but this time our stay was interrupted by loud drunken guests in the room next door taking calls to the front desk to help with ", 
    "Hilton experience. bathroom is quite small, but ok. A little older hotel but very clean.", 
    "We stay at the Palmer House given it's retro charm and the convenience of it's location. We have consistently enjoyed the ambience.", 
    "Prime location and excellent staff. A must if you are visiting Chicago on business and only have some spare time for sightseeing. At Palmer House Hilton you'll be just steps away from the Millennium Park and all the amazing architecture in and around the loop. The fitness center is top notch with a decent number of machines and free weights. The pool is quite small and closes at 9pm but the gym is 24/7. There's a spa in the building and a shopping center at the street level. This hotel couldn't be much more central. This was my first visit to Chicago and I really wanted to get some sightseeing in between all the meetings and time at the McCormick Place. Well, being at Palmer House Hilton I could easily get a good fill of the waterfront and nearby architecture without investing much more than an hour and a half. The rooms are clean and comfortable. I wish I had a fridge in mine (it's easy to end up with leftover deep dish from Giordano's!) but I was happy with the accommodation. Don't count on a view, however and depending on where your room is you may need a bit of time to get used to the sound of the L trains. Also, take photos of the ceiling in the lobby! It's magnificent! What a location for the hotel bar!", 
    "Rooms are small and worn. Front desk staff is not helpful. I tried to get a room and they told me they were sold out. I asked if they could recommend another Hilton hotel nearby and they told me they didn't know of any. I stepped away and booked a room in their hotel 2 minutes later via Expedia. ", 
    "enjoyed my stay and would stay again Hotel is close to restaurants, shopping and shuttle or buses", 
    "It was very busy, but staff were helpful and efficient. You cannot hear any traffic from State Street, which is always very busy. It was just what I needed.", 
    "The lounge, halls, bar, and room were elegant. Beautiful. Seemed very fancy for the price. Great location: very close to Millennium Park, great restaurants, plenty of train stops. Room was comfortable and plenty of HBO on TV, but bathroom was very small, the bathroom door did not keep closed, no active vent fan in bathroom. Worst thing was the staff. I'm an engineer by trade and I like to dress comfortably (button up flannel and jeans), and every lobby desk worker seemed to speak 1 decibel above audible, keep eyes fixed on their computer screens, and deliver the coldest smiles. A very obvious lack of warmth. This was also true for the greeter at the hotel restaurant, the Lockwood, though the waiter was nice and the food not the worst (but not worth the price tag). Go to the Gage gastropub 2 blocks away. All in all, the stay was adequate but not worthy of a return visit.", 
    "Pluses:Nice room for a fair price. Close to transit, shopping and the park. Negatives: No view. I could hear the neighbors and the bathroom was tiny. ", 
    "Myself, along with 4 of my close friends, stayed just one night, but in the end we all agreed it was a very pleasant experience. The room was spacious for 5 people and the staff was helpful during the check in and check out process. The valet parking was simply cherry on the cake. ", 
    "It was very comfortable. The staff were very helpful. I especially liked the fact that the heat did not turn off and on all night like it does in many chain hotels. ", 
    "The hotel and staff was great...everyone was helpful and friendly and the atmosphere was great! I would stay here again", 
    "The staff were generally helpful and some were very friendly, though some (especially some of the doormen and some of the restaurant staff) had more Chicago attitude than American friendliness. It would be nice if the doorman could pool tips with the bellmen, rather than holding his hand out for a separate tip. He might also try opening the (extremely difficult to open) door to the hotel for guests once in a while. The rooms were extremely spacious, though perhaps in need of a lick of paint and some new carpeting. And the bathrooms are well overdue for renewal. The public areas, however, are gorgeous in the extreme and it is lovely just to walk around the hotel.", 
    "My wife and I had a great time at the hotel. The heated swimming pool and the great breakfast buffet that came with our room was amazing!!! It is literally located right off State street, so after we checked out, we were able to leave our bags at the hotel and go shopping. It was a great experience! One issue was that our first room had a bug in it...but they moved us to another room with no problem at all. ", 
    "Nice ceiling in the lobby. Nice location. ok bedroom.", 
    "Beautifully maintained, historic hotel in a great Chicago location!", 
    "Great location for a visit to Chicago. Convenient to many sights and public transportation. ", 
    "We stayed in the Palmer House because we were seeing a magic show in the same building. The show was excellent and the convenience of being in the same building during the winter was excellent as well. I enjoyed the beauty of the hotel and the service in the Potter's Lounge. I would recommend staying here again, but beware there is no valet, only self-park. You get a 3 dollar discount from the hotel for parking.", 
    "Great time, great location........goto Millers Pub for dinner.", 
    "The hotel is beautiful and the food and staff were excellent. The hotel was very clean but the room cleaning staff could do a better job in the bathroom. Our room was small but very comfortable and quiet. Close to great shopping and theaters. Would definitely stay there again!", 
    "Lots to see and do. Took bus to Museums. Did not have to wait long, stop a shot distance away. Many dining places close by.", 
    "I REALLY ENJOYED THE HOTEL, WISH I WOULD HAVE BOOKED FOR THE WHOLE WEEKEND", 
    "The bathroom had a used bath towel in it. Also the room was very small, the pictures did not depicr such a small room.", 
    "The hotel is absolutely gorgeous! We stayed in a less expensive room and the comfort reflected that. The bathroom was very small. Next time we'll stay in a more expensive room. The hotel bar area was so nice and service was excellent all around. We also appreciated the free printing offered in the main lobby.", 
    "EXCELLENT!!", 
    "No complaints, except I wish the bathroom would have been as upscale as everything else.", 
    "Beautiful historic hotel. Staff very accommodating. The rooms were disappointingly small (with thin walls!) and in poor condition for such a grand hotel. The only way we'd revisit would be with a room upgrade.", 
    "I love the Palmer House and always stay here when in Chicago. It is a great, historical hotel right in the middle of the Chicago Loop. It is right on the Blue Line of the Chicago El from O'Hare Airport. It is one to four blocks walk to world-class public outdoor art (including the sculptures of Chagall, Picasso, Moore, And Miro); the Art Institute; Millennium Park; theaters; restaurants; bars/taverns and everything that makes downtown Chicago wonderful. The hotel interior is fabulous to see. The entire lobby area is like being in an Italian Art Museum with a ceiling that has to be seen to be believed. Get a drink at the bar and people watch. The rooms are comfortable, clean and quiet. Some may think the rooms are small, but that is the very nature of what historical, early 1900s, city-center hotels are all about. I always recommend the Palmer House.", 
    "Some other room left roomservice plates in hallway. They were there the entire 23 hours we stayed at the hotel.", 
    "This place is great! I would stay again and again. Staff was superb! Location is perfect!", 
    "Was a nice stay a little expensive for just a bed to keep in we enjoyed our adventure!", 
    "The stay was very comfortable, the staff was outstanding!", 
    "Stayed in executive suite. It was definitely worth it. Very large rooms. Nice continental breakfast. Our room had 3 bathrooms but they were each very small. Work out facility was great. Pool, well, they had one...", 
    "concierge gave great recommendations and printed out directions. Fabulous! Had to consult with the doctor on call (Dr. K) who was really great! Really appreciate that service was available and so easy.", 
    "My boyfriend and I had a romantic getaway for Valentine's Day! The hotel was great except when checking in, we were given a key to a room that was already occupied. After going back to the registration desk, where we already waited for about 30 minutes to check in, the issue was resolved quickly and we were offered beverage vouchers....", 
    "valentine weekend in downtown Chicago. Everything within walking distance", 
    "We had a wonderful stay. The check in was a bit congested when we got there but a nice woman asked if I was a Hilton Honors member and I went straight to the front and they gave me a glass of champaign! They also gave all the people waiting in line a glass. Very nice touch! The beds were a bit small but the room was lovely. Fresh clean white linens on the beds. It would be nice if the parking rate was a bit cheaper. Overall a wonderful stay.", 
    "Was a Valentines trip with my gf of 5 years and we both loved it!!! Room was clean sheets were fresh and service was great. Nothing greater than being in the heart of downtown. Accessible parking is next door and it was 42$ for overnight parking. good deal for being downtown! overall great stay we will be coming here again.", 
    "The hotel and the area was very nice because it was walking distance to many restaurants and the art museum that we were visiting. But I will say for the price, our room was quite small and very tight spaced. There was also what appeared to be a blue smudge marking on the closet door and the bathroom could have been a bit cleaner. But overall, my stay was decent since it was only for one night.", 
    "We stayed at this hotel for Valentines day. They would not let us check in early so we came back to the hotel around 3 to check with the intentions of checking in and getting ready for dinner reservations that were at 5:30. We waited over an hour to check in and still had to get ready. We ended up almost missing our reservations and all they did was apologizes.", 
    "I had a great experience, just the checkin and checkout line was slow due to the lack of more staff. The bar and the restaurant were really nice as well.", 
    "Very grand and beautiful hotel. Lobby is amazing. Good value and excellent location.", 
    "Very cold windy Chicago day, no doormen to be found. We had to search for valet. The hotel is beautiful, fortunately support staff is less than helpful. I would likely stay somewhere else next time.", 
    "Loved it.", 
    "This was our second stay at the Palmer House and it was as wonderful as ever. The staff are so exceptional! I travel a great deal and I have never experienced the level of professional staff that I have here.", 
    "Rooms are a bit cozy but still maintain a sense of elegance. Despite size, rooms were clean and guest services were great. The lobby's architecture and art is stunning. The lobby/bar is a solid and unique place to enjoy a drink before and after a night in Chicago whether you're staying at the Palmer House or not. Will be going back to check out the restaurants for sure. A true Chicago staple.", 
    "Our stay was brief and enjoyable. Rooms are not sound proof, you can hear water running from attached rooms. Service charge for everything.", 
    "Hotel is beautiful and fancy but the rooms are old and not the cleanest. Customer Service is great. Hotel is for the older crowd.", 
    "Overall, I am in the middle of whether I'd stay at the Palmer House again. The room was clean, the neighborhood was close to everything, the room with 1 king size bed was kind of small, but it was comfortable. There were 2 things that I did not like about this hotel. 1) I am in my 20's and obviously look young, I feel as if the staff treated my girlfriend and I different compared to the elder couples. For example, when we were walking through the lobby we felt as if they did not acknowledge us because of our age. This is my biggest pet peeve because I may be young, but I deserve the same respect as every other customer because I am also a PAYING customer.2) We ordered room service and the food made us sick. Don't get me wrong it was delicious, but it definitely did not agree with either one of our stomachs. With the 2 negatives I will say that they gave us a 1 hour late checkout for free, which most hotels charge you for. Also, the pool an hot tub are relaxing! Handicap accessible with a special chair that drops into the water!", 
    "Had a brief but comfortable stay in Chicago Palmer House. Eating at the hotel was expensive but the food was good. The bellmen were our favorites who went out of their way to treat us like valuable guests.", 
    "First weekend trip to Chicago for our Marine son. Met for an action packed weekend if fun. Pleasantly happy to find a beautiful, nastalgic hotel well maintained and located in the heart if the city. Pleasant and accommodating staff, updated room that was clean and beautiful. Couldn't have been mired pleased. We will definitely be back. ", 
    "I have very good time with my family in this hotel The lobby is very nice The only thing I don't like it in the lobby is too much people I can find any sit and the security peoples they watching you all the time if you're standing in the middle but the peoples in the reception and in that restaurant they are Betty nice", 
    "Comfortable stay at this wonderful hotel! The lobby is beautiful with all the historic decorations and it looks like a palace. The room we had was a bit small but the king bed and pillows were really comfortable, which was kinda important for us after a whole day walking in February's cold weather. Hotel is very close to the Millennium Park and the Art Institute (about 10 minutes walk), and has a Macy's, a CVS and a lot of places to shop and dine nearby. And even the Skydeck and Magnificent Mile are within walking distance! The were also problems like there were no complimentary bottle water in the hotel if you're not a member, and the in room wifi was surcharged. Although they have free wifi in the lobby but we found the lobby was always crowded and noisy at night.", 
    "So glad to finally stay at the Palmer. The lobby is amazing. The rooms are small but very clean and comfortable. Looks like the rooms are due for a renovation as small things like wallpaper coming off the bathroom walls slightly. For the price and location, you can't beat it.", 
    "Lovely Valentine's staycation that was busy but not unmanageable. While there were several events at the hotel, the staff was able to keep things moving along. Lots to look at and do nearby (great location), with easy access to the L. ", 
    "Upon arriving the hotel I was very impressed with the appearance and thought I got a great deal for the price I paid. The room was small and the bathroom wAsent even the size of my closet. While there I considered going to the spa with my husband I made reservations but later canceled due to other plans. After checking out of the hotel I discovered an employee at the spa let someone use my information to get an expensive massage and charge it to my credit card !!! I've called several times to get this issue solved but constantly getting the run around. I am still very upset and will never visit this hotel again ! ", 
    "Small room, dirty and uncomfortable. Had breakfast votchure but was not able to use it. Room was $139. Paper thin walls, no privacy. Need updating.", 
    "If you're looking for some history and nostalgic hotel for Chicago this one has it. It is not a first rate hotel by any means any means what the price was nice. I booked this hotel for me and my wife for Valentines weekend we have stayed here before but it's gone downhill a little bit. ", 
    "Nice hotel .. Good friendly staff .... Rooms are a little smaller than expected...", 
    "The hotel was simply gorgeous! Everything was perfect! The restaurant/ bar was great and convenient. The hotel have is a lot of options and opportunities to enjoy ourselves. The staff was nice and made me and my boyfriend feel very comfortable. Room service was everything and so was breakfast the next morning. Check out was so easy being that it was Valentine's Day weekend, I dialed 3 numbers and was checked out less than a minute. I will return in the future.", 
    "Hotel was beautiful. Easy check in and out. It was close by Michigan ave, which was a huge plus. I would recommend", 
    "Great getaway. Wish the room had a refrigerator. The parking was a bit expensive.", 
    "I enjoyed staying at the Palmer House. I did have to request to change rooms because the first option I was given there was a lot of youngsters having a great time, but that did not match with me or my needs, so I was changed to a better room with a bit quieter neighbors. What can improve is the information provided to the guests about the Palmer House and its history and of Chicago, on events, tourist info, a map for instance would not hurt. I did not try the restaurants, perhaps if the brownie was invented here, you could include a small brownie as a welcome gift, so one can appreciate the significance of staying in such a location.", 
    "we stayed at the Palmer house for a weekend away with plans for a concert at the CSO. the hotel is historic and beautiful!!! it is a thrill to sit in the lobby. our room was comfortable but small. the bed was comfortable but not special. We splurged and had tea which was yummy but not as fancy as I imagined it would be. The breakfest buffet was good and reasonably priced for once. the location of the hotel was PERFECT for downtown activites and shopping. We were able to walk to a concert, so convenient. They did not hype their expensive hotel valet parking and quickly offered a parking structure one block away for half the price of valet. I appreciated that. I would definitely stay here again.", 
    "Went to Chicago in business's for three days so fit in one extra day for sightseeing. The concierge Debbie was fabulous!!! We did everything she recommended and she was spot in with every call. We had a quick bite at Rudys did a 2 hr minibus tour which was great, drinks at John Hancock from the 96th floor, the sight was amazing.. Then we had cheeses and wine at the purple pig which was so cool then lastly we went to 3 dots and a dash. Which was a very cool tropical Hawaiian bar in the back alley.. So much fun! The hotel was so spectacular with its historic flair. And close to the L and avenue and eateries . Highly recommend ", 
    "I have stayed here many times and I love it. Great location and rooms are very clean! I will be back soon!", 
    "Beautiful hotel right inside the loop and near everything", 
    "Loved our stay there. We were put into a large room - but it was a wheelchair-ready room so the water flowed freely from the shower into the general bathroom area (since it was built to work with someone taking a wheelchair in). The room also had view of the outside, since it on the 8th floor and came up against the next building - which I felt I could almost touch if I reached out of the window. These were acceptable knocks for an otherwise excellent facility, complete with top rate service and amenities. ", 
    "This historic grand hotel has been well kept up. Bathroom was showing some age, with a bit of discolored caulking and grout, but overall the room, hallways, and lobby are in great shape. Large, quiet room with easy HVAC controls, good selection of TV channels.", 
    "This was the second time I stayed here -- very comfortable and friendly staff", 
    "Very nice staff and the services were excellent.N/a", 
    "Have stayed there several times and it is always a pleasant experience. This time one of the bathrooms had a \"funky\" smell to it that was never taken care of. The people at the concierge desk are always there to assist and answer any questions, very patiently. In terms of customer service, I have not been to many hotels that equal the Palmer House. ", 
    "It's been quite a few years since my last stay at the Palmer House and the rooms are greatly improved. The bed was comfortable and the shower great. Our window was open when we arrived and it was freezing. But it quickly warmed once I shut it. The elevator was frustrating as only certain ones go to the higher floors and it could take a long time to get one that wasn't already crammed full. I wish that they had chosen to put guests on the same floor as the ones that were a part of the high school convention going on. Was kept awake til well after midnight due to slamming doors and giggling girls. ", 
    "Front desk staff were outstanding, concierge also, extremely helpful. ", 
    "This historic hotel is beautiful. The staff is incredibly helpful and top notch. The rooms were large and the bedding was comfortable. We stayed during college unifieds, so there was some noise when students would sing in their rooms & in the halls. The location is perfect for downtown Chicago with parking nearby.", 
    "Lovely old hotel that overall they've done a wonderful job keeping it up. However the bathroom had little counter space and the shower drained poorly which is the only reason for a less than perfect rating.", 
    "Overall -- it was good! Room was very clean and friendly staff", 
    "The hotel is a historic classic located between the business district and great dining. The facilities are modern yet 1920's looking. Good gym although I'd like more stretching area. Most rooms are comfortable although every now and then I get a tiny one. Overall my go-to hotel in Chicago.", 
    "Came to the Palmer House for unified auditions. The service at the door and at the check-in desk were excellent. Executive level room and amenities made our stay comfortable and stress free. I did find the restaurants to be pricey. Would suggest a more casual dining option within the hotel.", 
    "Unique historic hotel with a lobby bar in a great setting", 
    "Lobby is beautiful, room was clean, rates were reasonable. Great location and there is a Starbucks right on the ground floor. Hotel employees were friendly and accommodating. Requested a humidifier. One was brought to the room immediately and I was even told that they would come back periodically and fill it up if I didn't want to do it!", 
    "I love staying in the Palmer House! It was very quiet (blizzard over the weekend), but everyone on staff was friendly and helpful. I'll be back....", 
    "The rooms were very neat and clean however they lacked the necessities. I was surprised to see that the hotel did not provide disposable toothbrushes and there was only one bar of soap for handwashing and body washing. The hotel was severely understaffed due to a storm which I understood. However breakfast took two hours, no exaggeration, and the employee taking the order seemed slightly annoyed. They did however call to let me know that the wait was going to be longer than they first quoted me (which was an hour). Dinner service was backed up as well, but the food was great and the manager was very apologetic about the inconvience. The swimming area and hot tub were fantastic, very well maintained. The staff throughout the stay didn't speak or smile much. Overall it wasn't a terrible night. Things happen. I will be back this month and hopefully things run smoothly.", 
    "This is a great looking hotel with a fabulous lobby and very good staff. But there is pathetic nickle and diming going on by the Hilton--extra charge for internet, a charge for checking in early (11:00 am) even when lots of rooms are available. Great hotels don't do this. Still I would recommend staying there for its old-style grandeur.", 
    "favorite spot in Chicago", 
    "other than the bathroom being very small, our stay was perfect. excellent location,great lobby and gathering place for hanging out during long waits, large, elegant room, beautiful sheets. starbucks in hotel and freshii, while not perfect, tries and keeps up with healthy appetites. valet and bell captains get gold stars.", 
    "It was very luxurious feeling and the staff definitley was willing to help. But the phone calls from the room cost a 1.50 each and the WiFi cost money as well.", 
    "Loved the hotel and all the amenities like pool, hot tub access..etc! I booked the room with 2bathrooms which was nice so everyone could get ready but room wasn't as glamorous as I thought it would be. The lobby area and bar were beautiful. We ate at the restaurant Potters which had overpriced food that was awful! I would stay at this hotel if I would get a great discount again I wouldn't pay over $200 a night.", 
    "Room was extra large, food was very good yet expensive but expected at a hotel like this. Staff was very accommodating. Would stay there again. ", 
    "I called ahead to ask if the front desk could please pull aside a toiletry item I forgot to pack, knowing I'd be getting in after midnight and would want to get right to bed. They took my name said they would have it waiting for me. I checked in, and the item wasn't pulled aside. The front agent told me that they were out of them at the desk and I should have called ahead, and now I'd have to wait for housekeeping to get one, which would be a 20 minute wait. I *did* call ahead... These little things can make a difference in a stay. Also, the room was not very clean. There were other peoples' stray hairs everywhere.", 
    "typically saw 10-15 people waiting for elevators on a given floor. They are archaic. 3-4 elevators solely servicing 8 floors leading to long wait times which is a pain when trying to go to work in the morning. However, at least they were working 3 out of the 4 nights. The walk down the stairs from the 18th floor was not fun on one of the nights.", 
    "Nice Hotel but outdated.", 
    "Great Location!!! Nice rooms!", 
    "I always love staying at the Palmer House. It's an historic building so of course you don't get ALL the luxuries of a new hotel, but the ongoing upkeep and maintenance is evident. The only thing you really miss out on is size. The rooms are smaller than most newer hotels, but I love it here.", 
    "Well maintained, great location, beautiful lobby", 
    "It's was nice clean and comfortable.", 
    "Would go back in a heartbeat!", 
    "Beautiful, historic hotel in the heart of the loop. We stayed one night to celebrate a birthday and found it very conveniently located to everything we wanted to do and see. ", 
    "Great hotel, Loads of character, centrally located, helpful staff. It was better than I had expected from looking at the website, would recommend it and consider staying there again. Was there for the ASHRAE conference so hotel was fully occupied for first part of stay, so lifts were busy, but after the conference no problems at all", 
    "The bathroom was tight. You could not close the door unless to straddled the toilet. Also they did not offer complementary coffee or tea in the room or even offered water in the room for a fee. You had to go all the way to the lobby to the gift store to purchase the water. Not even the vending machines on the floor offered water...", 
    "I enjoyed my stay. However the only issue i had was that the drawers in the room were not cleaned out as there was old food and cigarettes.", 
    "Great service, a true testament to old school Chicago architecture and design. Super friendly staff and conveniently located.", 
    "The hotel was great, however there was a lack of cleanliness. When we entered our room, there was a clump of hair on the dresser. I believe the previous girl who stayed in the room forgot her extensions. Other than we had a comfortable stay. My friends and I stayed there to celebrate my 28th Birthday.", 
    "This historic hotel is gorgeous! If more than one person is staying in a room, you may find the bathroom to be uncomfortably small. It's a large hotel and can seem confusing at times, especially because of the offset levels between the conference area and hotel area. We come here frequently so we've got the layout down, but for a first-timer it can be frustrating.", 
    "Massive hotel with plenty to do on the premises and in the immediate area. Room was nice, but the pool area was quite chilly. Decor was amazing because of the holiday season and the staff was nice, accommodating, and on point when I needed them.", 
    "Beautiful, historic hotel, great area, friendly and efficient staff. Highly recommend!", 
    "Beautiful place! We were surprised the hotel was \"pet friendly\"! I thought $50 was pretty steep for our dog, but since we got a good rate on the room, we didn't make a fuss. Would definitely return! (Without the dog!)", 
    "Beautiful first impression, gorgeous hotel and fantastic atmosphere but quality of rooms do not mirror the essence of the hotel. The morning time was loud, as expected per other guests checking out, but housekeeping was knocking on my door at 9:30 am when checkout was at 11. ", 
    "Overall, we had a great experience. We were put in a \"handicapped\" room, without requesting or needing it, and that meant we had a walk-in shower, but no bathtub. On the plus side, there was an enormous walk-in closet that made luggage storage easy.", 
    "We stayed at the Palmer House, and it was a very nice experience. The lobby is beautiful and awe-inspiring. The hot tub could use a little updating, but otherwise the hotel is a beautiful and comfortable place to stay.", 
    "We had a great time at this hotel. The room was spacious and very clean. The hotel location was right in the middle of the Loop so we walked to almost every \"must\" see landmark. My only dislike about our room was that you could hear anyone walking down the hallway or in the rooms next door, not much sound proof.", 
    "The soul of a great hotel. Location is tremendous to the L, attractions, food and entertainment. The facilities are beautiful and efficient from the elevators and business center to the bar. I look forward to my next visit. ", 
    "Great and historic hotel with modern amenities in a very good location. It's right next to the L, very convenient, but if you think the noise will annoy you, you may want to request a room on the higher floors. From up there the train sounds like a central ac unit coming on and off. Beautiful place!", 
    "It was great! We do not usually stay in hotels quite that fancy so it was hard to figure out who to tip and how much to tip. Aside from that the hotel was beautiful and the staff was very accommodating! If I ever get back to Chicago, I would stay here again!!!!", 
    "the hotel is old. you could see theres an attempt to modernize the room that we got but still old. there was no view from our window (another wall of a bldg, i guess). i wish there were choices such as a city view or something like that. the room that we got doesnt have a lot of room to put our toiletries. it's just the sink and small area to put our toothbrushes. no coffee maker in the room. the beds are comfy, though. no list of channels in the room so we had to change t he channels to see which one was it. the room was reserved for 4 people, but the towels that were there were only 3. ", 
    "Lobby area of hotel is beautiful. Rooms especially bathrooms are very small and need to be updated. Bathroom door was warped and shower was full of mold and lime deposits.", 
    "I reserved a 1bed 2 bath suite. I live in Chicago and wanted to do a staycation. When I arrived at the hotel, the room wasn't ready. I was given my room key and told that I would receive a text in about 1hrs with room number when it was ready. We decided to go shopping on State Street, 2 1/2 hrs later, I realized that I hadn't received a text. I went back to registration desk and 20 minutes later, they finally decided to assign another room. I had spa services scheduled at Balance Spa and Salon. This was the only portion of my stay that was worth every dime spent. The staff was friendly and professional. My masseuse, Shalawn gave the best Swedish massage. My manicurist did an great job. Because of the delay in room assignment, I didn't notice the condition of the room until I returned from my spa services. The walls were.dirty, the furniture was old and raggedy, with scratches. The furniture could be called eclectic, but really it was just tacky. The color scheme was Brown, purple, green and beige.UGH. The second bathroom had mildew in the shower. My bed had springs. I was too relaxed and exhausted to deal with changing rooms. I really should have. My best friend insisted that we order room service because we didn't have the energy to leave the room or get dressed, etc The food from room service.....gross. The food was supposed to be from the hotels restaurant called Lockwood. The short ribs were dried out and old. Steamed vegetables had to be microwaved. ", 
    "Had a wonderful weekend! No complaints at all. Service was excellent! Staff was very helpful", 
    "I have always wanted to stay at The Palmer House. I had heard stories about how historic it was, and wanted to experience for myself. When I was informed at work that I would be spending 5 days in Chicago I took the opportunity to book this historic hotel. The Palmer House met all the expectations that I had set for it from the time I walked in until I checked out. Walking into the hotel for the first time is nothing short of amazing. The people at the front desk were helpful and very nice to work with. I stayed on the 17th floor \"which does not have the larger rooms\". The room was very clean and tidy. It was a very small room which I expected from reading about the hotel. The only thing I would have changed about the stay is that the bathroom is small, I mean tiny small. However that would not deter me from staying here again. The restaurant downstairs was good as well. Overall a great stay in a great city.", 
    "Excellent! I'll recommend it!", 
    "Despite arranged check-in for my wife days in advance, she had to wait for me to leave the convention to get her into our room. When unpacking clothes, she discovered men's dirty underwear in the top drawer of the dresser. This really didn't start well and overall our stay was disappointing. Day 2 there were no new bath towels and I simply won't stay at this hotel again. Despite it's long heritage, employees in lobby and street level very unprofessional and I very much wish that I had selected almost anywhere but Palmer House. ", 
    "Great room. Awesome hotel. Will stay again", 
    "Everything was great except the main entrance door to the room had 1\" opening on the bottom and we could hear everybody walking in the hallway.", 
    "Great location and beautiful hotel with lots of charm. We come stay in the city at least once a month and the Palmer House is one that we will definitely come back to soon. ", 
    "Would definitely stay here again. Beautiful hotel.. Maybe a little \"old\" for some but I think that gives it charm!! Had a problem the first night with a bachelor party going on in the room next to us, manager had us moved in less than 10 minutes! Service was outstanding! Cleaning people could do better (hair in soap dish of shower-not from someone's head either!) beds were ok. Loved the tablet in the room! Nice touch", 
    "We took an over night stay in the city to spend a few days at the museum.", 
    "Genial ....mejor de lo esperado", 
    "Checking in and out was a breeze. Room was comfortable. I left a brief case in my room and was able to retrieve it easily. Lobby, as always, beautiful and lively.", 
    "Perfect location to stay in downtown Chicago, only 10 minute cab ride to great restaurants and activities. The hotel itself is a hidden gem with great decor and photos of stars from the past. The lounge is a great place to relax and enjoy the surrounding architecture.", 
    "The stay was very nice, had a great time. Plus you can't beat the location!", 
    "Perfect for business or pleasure", 
    "I'd give the Palmer House a 3.75 out of 5 if I could. Historic building with a beautiful lobby, the Palmer House comes up just short of living up to its potential. Being a very large hotel means there is a lack of attentiveness from the staff. While clean and spacious, our room was strangely and uncomfortably laid out, and the bathroom was far too small. Location and price are hard to beat, and would stay there again based on those alone.", 
    "Love the vibe of this hotel. Potter's was closed so had to eat in lobby area serviced by Lockwood. Server was pretty slow and low energy. The good was fantastic! Ate the Buffet breakfast the next morning and it was very good! The room was a nice size. Beds are only doubles (prefer queen size if two sharing). Love the comforters! We had a 2 bath. One bath was super tiny. Door had to be carved out to fit around the toilet bowl when shutting the door. 2 nd bath was nice size but dirty (hair on floor). Pool is really small and not the nicest but ok ", 
    "Beautiful hotel. Great location. Easy to get to everything and the concierge is very helpful.", 
    "The hotel is beautiful. The staff was friendly. The location was perfect. We have stayed there twice. The only thing I wish they had was free wifi. ", 
    "I booked our weekend getaway for my bf's birthday. I had called ahead to have a wine bottle and strawberries in the room before arrival. When I checked in I asked if the room was set up like I had asked. The front desk made a call to room service to find out that it was not set up. The request was put in immediately, however it dragged to get to the room. The 'wow' moment was not there when I opened the door. So I was disappointed with that aspect.", 
    "Beautiful hotel and great location. At checkin ask people about validating parking.", 
    "Great hotel for a weekend getaway. This will be our go-to hotel for stays in downtown Chicago. A block from the Art Institute of Chicago and walkable to most of the sights. Public spaces are spectacular. The rooms tend to be a little odd due to restrictions on renovating this historic building, but the location cannot be beat. Great desk staff and special package rates make this a gem.", 
    "We had a great time, the hotel is beautiful!", 
    "It was awesome! Al at the desk was great to deal w/ and was very professional! Girls offered to take our pics.Will plan on staying again!! Tganks!!", 
    "The only complaint is that the room was not sound resistant. We could hear our neighbors late into the night and early in the morning. ", 
    "We were very pleased with everything about this hotel! We were there for one night, so it was perfect for us.", 
    "Relaxing and wonderful. Enough said!", 
    "Awesome Hotel, great Location downtown Chicago", 
    "Very average place, tiny room, uncomfortable bed, rude doorman, nice concierge", 
    "Beautifully maintained historic building with modern amenities. ", 
    "we really liked our stay at the Palmer House which is actually one of the sights in Chicago (especially because of its marvelous lobby that also houses a great bar the location is just perfect if you want to explore the city after we got a free upgrade, our room was really nice, the original one a little depressing though as are the corridors - none of the rooms feature a great view however given the standard of the rest of the hotel and especially the appearance of the lobby where it was taking place, the breakfast wasn't all that great but still okay for the price in summary: thumbs up", 
    "All I can is wow. What a hotel and what a experience and the best part is the location. The hotel itself is absolutely amazing. The meeting rooms are from a long ago era. If going to Chicago consider it!", 
    "i was in 23-159 i think there was a helicopter on the roof each night", 
    "great service, very pretty building. Great location. One of the nicest hotels I ever stayed at! The \"help\" is probably the best I have ever experienced. Housekeeping was perfect, and they were all very kind. Staff extremely helpful.", 
    "A quick overnight trip -- had to catch an early morning bus to Indianapolis. Wish I had more time to enjoy the room and the hotel.", 
    "Nice hotel in the Loop close to Millennium Park. Good atmosphere.", 
    "Beautiful place!!", 
    "I would be happy with just such a hotel experience everywhere and anywhere. Capacious, stylish room, very able, friendly staff.", 
    "Beautiful lobby and lounge. Good friendly service. Would come again. ", 
    "The room and bathroom were small but they usually are in vintage hotels. But, spending time in the spectacular lobby are what staying in a vintage hotel is all about. You can just feel the history all around you.", 
    "was in Chicago on Business, always choose the Palmer House to unwind.", 
    "Bathrooms are relatively small compared to the executive suite I stayed in, but the full-size bathtub was appreciated.", 
    "Amazing hotel, great staff, very reasonable price for the Loop.", 
    "My husband and I went to Chicago for the the weekend to see Chicago Bulls. The hotel staff gave us a list of nearby resturants to choose from in the area. Since we decieded to explore the area. Starbucks was downstairs so we had great coffee. Our room was clean and the bathrrom was stocked. I would definitely go back to Palmer House.", 
    "Service was entirely helpful and pleasant . I was greeted courteously by everyone and assisted. The check-in was extremely speedy and I was impressed by the desk clerk's patience when I gave her the wrong card.", 
    "The staff at The Palmer House Hotel are very friendly and always go out of their way to assist you with any little thing you might need.", 
    "My husband and I went for a get-away-weekend. The hotel is in a great location of shopping, restaurants, and Millennium Park", 
    "Did a surprise get-away for my boyfriend. Hotel was beautiful and a great location for us to walk around and play tourists, as well as eat and drink at some of our favorite spots.", 
    "After staying here for a night with my boyfriend, we accidentally left a piece of expensive jewelry in the room after checking out. After communicating with security they developed some crazy story about how the watch was mysteriously not in the room. The manager was no help, he told me he didn't have time to talk to me or help me and denied my request to investigate the issue further. I requested a call back from a different manager and never got it. I will never support this business again.", 
    "the hotel itself was a very wonderful experience it was very beautiful definitely would go back to the hotel the only real problem I had was the walls in the rooms were pretty as in I could be laying on the bed and I could hear the people next door opening a can of soda little uneasy because it was a huge family and they were up till midnight but other than that it was a good experience", 
    "Great staff! Super friendly! Love the Judy Garland posters in the hotel halls. Thanks!", 
    "Good", 
    "Room was smaller than advertised, purchased Executive King suite only to have standard size room with king size bed crammed inside.", 
    "Great location. Well run hotel. unexpected cons with my room: no microwave, no fridge, no free wifi unless you go to the lobby. But a fair price for the high standard of the hotel and the location.", 
    "I'm a frequent traveler I use Hilton establishments quite often, The Palmer Hilton was not up to my expectations. My stay at other Hilton establishments set a high bar. Slow and no room services Had to pay for servives that other Hiltons give free. paying for extra amenities Very expensive. difficulty in finding parking.", 
    "My wife and I were there Dec. 11th for our anniversary, before we checked in we went to the Academic club and to see a performance at the symphony. We checked in and the staff were friendly. The parking was nearby in the Monroe garage, and it was straight forward. The only drawback is that we didn't get a Continental breakfast with our deal and you had to pay for WiFi. But we will definitely consider returning. It's really a terrific and historic place. ", 
    "While the rooms are small, they clean and quiet. The lobby is a beautiful place for a gathering. Parking is a little expensive, but understandable for the location downtown. Overall great stay. ", 
    "Stayed on a new years eve with family and because of policies they explained to every client during check in, we had a very quite stay that we could sleep in the middle of the night. Though very busy, it was a fun place to stay and our room was very clean", 
    "The hotel is definitely old glam style. It's at great location and everything is almost readily available near by. the stay would have been great if it wasn't for the following: * wifi cost 10 per night. i've been to countless hotels and never had to paid additional for it. it's a necessity these days for people and not exactly a perk that should be paid for. * room cleaning service. woke me up at 8:30 to clean room because i didnt put up the do not disturb sign. i was planning on getting up at 9 and didn't think any hotels clean that early. Following day when i do put up the sign, i could hear the surrounding rooms getting cleaned and got woken up anyways. 2 bad nights of sleep.", 
    "Everything was great, beautiful hotel and friendly staff. I wish WiFi was included in the price of the room instead of a separate charge.", 
    "very relaxing and everyone that worked here was very polite. I didn't know about the $50 deposit or the $41 dollar charge a night for my car in their garage but other than those unexpected charges it was nice.", 
    "Spent two nights. Location was perfect for visiting Millenium Park and the new Maggie Daly Park (the wait to rent ice skates was over 2 hrs long. Best to bring your own.) Also, perfect for visiting the Art Institute of Chicago, a most amazing museum. 5+ hrs barely touched the opportunities. Concierge desk was very helpful in providing info for buses to the north of the river Michigan Ave and Navy Pier area. Good price for room; had everything we needed since we were mostly sleeping there until the next day's activities.", 
    "Beautiful historic hotel walking distance to Millenium Park and Art Institute. We did have an issue with the cleanliness of our first room but were moved to another room with no problems. The foyer is stunning and staff very friendly and helpful. Would recommend staying here.", 
    "While our general experience was very good, room comfortable and the staff very helpful, the Lockwood was understaffed on New Years day in the afternoon and it took an hour for us to get food. Food lacked a range of choices and was overpriced. Fortunately there are many fine and more reasonable restaurants in the area. The hot tub in the pool area is in serious need of a makeover, bordered on disgusting. Still it is a beautiful historic building, and a fun place to stay", 
    "Beautiful, well appointed hotel. Staff was wonderful. My only negative comment is that I did not like the pillows!", 
    "Could not believe that microwave and refrigerator cost money. We had to go eat for every meal. Otherwise nice hotel.", 
    "Definitely staying here again!!! The NYE party was amazing!", 
    "You get everything you can expect from the Palmer House. Perfect location for exploring the city. We stayed in an executive room which was big and comfy. The complimentary breakfast wasn't the best hotel breakfast we've had but there is a lot of places close by where you can get something to eat in the morning. Would definitely recommend this hotel and we will be back during our next visit to Chicago.", 
    "I have stayed here many times and I love the hotel. The rooms are a little small."

    "great trip to Chicago. had lots of fun. Great location", 
    "The hotel was in a great spot, with plenty of dining options close by. The room was nice but a bit awkwardly set up with the tv against the long wall, between the bed and sofa. It didn't point towards either one and was too wide to twist completely. There should be free wifi for all. I object to paying for wifi in an expensive hotel.", 
    "Awesome hotel right in the middle of Michigan Ave. The guys out front were the nicest, giving you direction and telling you the best places to eat! Would stay again ", 
    "The turndown service staff are quite invasive. The night I checked in, someone knocked at around 6pm and asked if I ordered turndown service which I did not since I just arrived. Each morning between 9am to 11am in 30min intervals someone would knock and/or use a room key to come cleam the room - quite annoying if you are trying to sleep in on the weekend. On one of the nights, I left my room for an hour only to find the turndown service came in and replaced the soaps and give one new towel. It seems that they must have come in and realized that I was out for a few minutes and left. The odd thing was that they filled my ice bucket?? Maybe they were planning to take a break or thought that I went out for ice?? I have a few theories; they like to be very clean (doubtful), they have bad processes and re-clean rooms for no apparent reason only to keep their jobs (plausible), some suspect activities going on like going through people's luggage (plausible). Room was nice an renovated but turndown service is very invasive.",

    "We were disappointed that our room was not ready when promised. We had to wait nearly an hour for our room to be ready. We had just driven seven hours with kids and we wanted to relax but could not do so. Also, the refrigerator was so small that it could not hold any food at all. The mini bar was over the top. We could have spend hundreds of dollars on ordinary crappy snacks that we could get from Walgreen's down the street. We had to take all of the high-priced items out of reach so as not to confuse the kids and allow them to eat a $5.00 Snicker's Bar or drink a $7.00 bottle of water!!! The positives were that the beds were comfortable and the location of the hotel is in close proximity to so much in downtown Chigago.", 
    "Hotel was very nice, but unless you dont want to spend a ton of money this place isn't for you. you have to pay $10 a night for wifi, they don't even let you have it for free after you've spend $150 on the room per night already. Plus parking is a little obnoxious $67 per day is a lot. They come to your room quite a bit and it's a little unsettling knowing they're coming to your room more than once. ", 
    "My daughter and I had a wonderful \"Girls Getaway\". Staying at the Omni was outstanding and a quick walk to the American Girl store, which was the reason for our trip.

The maximum number of people allowed in the hot tub was 3 and there were usually way more than that in it. The way to the pool was not well marked and it took wandering around for a while to find it. Room was great as we got one of the recently remodeled ones. ",

    "Loved the location the staff the room was great and I really the wonderful staff my kids enjoyed and had fun I will be coming back", 
    "My girlfriend and I had what we call a zen weekend lol. Get we from everything meditate, just relax and it was perfect although the bed was a little to0 hard for the both of us the overall rating was great. That is why the rating for the room comfort was rated what it was. I would def stay here again! Will be back soon!", 
    "It was a really nice hotel, check in and out was easy. They brought our bags up to our room for us. I got a suite with some people and the view was amazing. I loved being able to look out the window at all the lights. The room was very clean and the bathroom was very nice. The only thing I didn't like was that there wasn't a microwave and no forks or knives. ", 
    "Great hotel, great staff, very good service. Had family and staff was great with children. Located near all downtown amenities!", 
    "Great location, clean hotel, helpful concierge", 
    "excellent across the board", 
    "I love everything easy check in and easy check out rooms are super clean and comfy definitely a 5 star", 
    "Most comfortable hotel bed and pillows of all hotels I have stayed in around the world - crazy! I wanted to purchase the pillow from my bed - unfortunately that is not allowed.", 
    "The food seemed to be priced high but other then that everything was great", 
    "Great staff can't say enough. They even have a driver during the week that will drop u at museums and other close destinations. The only thing is our room furniture was really worn and out dated. It would been nice to have a couch instead of two chairs. We wold stay here again the location is absolutely perfect.", 
    "We stayed in a king suite, and were first booked into an older room that was desperate for an update. I called and was graciously moved to a newly renovated room on a higher floor. It was much better. Overall, I like the Omni, but I prefer to stay in the Kimpton hotels in Chicago. That said, if you're visiting Chicago, you can't beat the location.", 
    "I expected for the amount of money that we paid, that the room would be better. The TVs were outdated and the Decor. They charge 76 dollars for parking. That is unacceptable. ", 
    "I suprised my husband with a trip to Chicago for his birthday. The hotel is in a good location, central to everything you could want downtown. We stayed in a higher floor which was recently renovated and looked great. Since the hotel is right on Michigan Ave, you hear everything outside even from 17+ floors up. Sirens were going off at all hours of the night which made for the worst sleep we ever had. On top of that, the construction people were renovating floors above us and we hear them working starting at 7 AM. The staff were great and very friendly! Gym was one of the best I have used. I was just disappointed how much noise you could hear.", 
    "WE HAD A GREAT TIME! GREAT LOCATION! WE WILL BE BACK FOR SURE.", 
    "The staff was extremely friendly and the room were nicely appointed.", 
    "We came to Chicago for a weekend get-away. We chose the Omni off Hotels.com based on reviews, price, and location. We will definitely choose the Omni again for a stay in Chicago!", 
    "I enjoyed our stay. The room layout and cleanliness was excellent. The hotel itself while still very good is starting to show some wear and tear. Nothing bad, it is just that it does not feel fresh anymore. Some scuff marks in the hallway and the like. But a very enjoyable stay overall. Also, excellent location and service.", 
    "no free wifi", 
    "Nice and clean room. A little small though. Freindly staff however need to improve in room wifi.", 
    "Super friendly staff, suite type rooms, great comfy bed. Would have preferred not to spend $5 on a glass of cranberry juice (the beer was $4) but overall a very nice hotel. Highly recommended.", 
    "We LOVED our stay at the Chicago Omni....ONLY 1 or 2 drawbacks. The hotel failed to tell us about the $100 deposit for \"incidentals\" but after speaking with the manager we quickly worked around that, and the hotel also failed to tell us that we could drop our luggage off at the hotel prior to the 3pm check in time, so we lugged all our stuff around with us =( The hotel staff was extremely nice, room was nice and clean....not too bad considering we were not in one of the newly renovated rooms (however, we'll make sure we are for our next trip) The location was PERFECT!! 2 blocks walk from the American Girl Place, pool area was FABULOUS! We LOVED our stay at the OMNI and will DEFINATELY be staying there the next time we travel to Chicago. I HIGHLY recommend this hotel =)", 
    "The valet and doorman staff were the friendliest!!! The front desk seemed bothered by our request for a fan. Pool and hot tub area clean and quiet. The milk and cookies brought to our room for the kids was a nice touch!", 
    "We were very disappointed at this omni hotel. For starters, this hotel looked like it needed a renovation before anything. This place is considered a 4 star hotel,and our suite had an old box television in it that couldn't even be watched. They told us they had 24 room service so we ordered a late night snack that we never even received. All in all, I stay at Omni hotels all across the country and I thoroughly enjoy doing so, but this is an Omni I don't believe I'm ever visiting again.", 
    "My daughter and I went for a girls weekend and the hotel was perfect. Great location for shopping and restaurants, we could walk everywhere we wanted to go. Very ckean, comfortable and staff was helpful and friendly.", 
    "The neighbor in the room next to us was so loud we had to call security. We will not stay at the Omni again! ", 
    "Bathtub was dirty with hairballs. They had a big group on both sides of us that ran between the rooms and we're loud.", 
    "We arrived at 5:30 and our room wasn't ready. We had to stay in the hotel restaurant, with two young kids, for 3 hours until it was ready. They initially gave us a $30 voucher, which was enough for an appetizer and a glass of wine. They also would not give us any estimate of how long it would be until our room would be ready, so we were in limbo the whole time. When we got to the corner suite it was quite cold. Even though the thermostat read 71 degrees, I think it was in the lower 60s. I had to turn the heat up to 80 for it be be comfortable. Even so, cold air poured from the windows onto the bed in the bed room and I woke up with cold ears. In addition, parking is outrageous - $67 a night - and it takes them the full 15-20 they estimate to get your car for you. For a hotel with this reputation I expected much, much more.", 
    "Great location, easy access. I recommend parking across the street at the Chicago Place... roughly half the price of valet at the hotel.", 
    "A trip to Chicago for NewYears Eve night for my husband and I. We have stayed here several times and enjoy the comfort of the Omni. The staff here are always so friendly and very attentive. Make sure you try the breakfast brunch. It is delicious and all food is brought in from neighboring farms.", 
    "Great location amazing staff lovely room comfortable beds awesome bar delicious buffet breakfast", 
    "I travel often for business and our family spends 3-5 weekends in Chicago each year. The Omni has a 3:00 check in. We arrived at 2:30 and was told our room wouldn't be ready until 3 or 3:30. No problem. We did a bit of shopping, but with an 8 year old in tow in cold weather, we returned to the hotel lobby at 3:30. We didn't get our room key until 4:40 p.m. The front desk personnel repeatedly told me that housekeeping was working off of a master list and there wasn't anything they could do. We entered room 502 in complete darkness. The entry alcove had a silver plate covering where there used to be a light. The light switch didn't turn on any lamps, and the lamp next to the couch wasn't working. The drapes were drawn as the cord was broken, so we couldn't open it to get more light. I have never stayed in such a dimly lit room. You literally had to strain your eyes to search through the luggage. The room was in dire need of updating. The carpet was incredibly worn. The sofa sleeper was low rate. It looked like one you would purchase for a college dorm room. To say we were disappointed would be a huge understatement. I would never stay at the Omni Chicago again.", 
    "Not clean, outdated. Custmer service was very good though.", 
    "Where do I start. For a room to cost $179 before tax, hotel fees and parking I reall expected more. So I'll start with the positives, the location was great, we were able to check in an hour early, and it has a pool. The unfortunate side, I picked up the room when we arrived, the bed was terribly uncomfortable, the toilet was dirty, the outlets in the room were not functioning properly, the pool area was completely trashed - there were plastic cups littering the bottom of the pool, there were used towels scattered all over the area, there were no clean towels and we had to use the hand towels from the fitness area, two calls were made for towels and after 30 minutes we still did not see new towels. Fortunately for us we were able to use our Rewards money towards this stay, however, I would say the $87 it cost us out of pocket is all this stay was worth. We will not be staying here again.", 
    "My daughter and I met her best friend and mother for a girl's weekend in Chicago and we had a very positive experience. None of us had ever been, so we relied on the concierge for recommendations. Amiri was very friendly and took his time giving us recommendations for fun things to do and interesting places to eat. Every member of the staff that we interacted with were friendly and helpful. The room was very spacious and clean and they even left cookies in the room at night for the girls, which they loved! ", 
    "The only complaint I have is that our check in time was delayed by 2 hours. And at first, yes that was frusterating but the hotel is magnificent. Very comforting and clean, and makes you feel right at home. It's right on the magnificent mile which makes it all the better. The hotel staff was super helpful and very attentive. I would definitely go back here with family or friends. I highly recommend this hotel. ", 
    "7:30pm checkin finally, room not ready. My kid found a shot glass on the ledge behind the drapes. Extremely noisy with no soundproofing between rooms. Don't look at the pictures online. They're lies. $70 parking not included. No fridge or microwave in suites. Pool is a large bathtub", 
    "Very disappointed and overpriced for a 4 1/2 star hotel being in Magnificent Mile. It was more like a 2 star hotel to me. Full size beds instead of queen, and a sofa that felt like sitting on a rock. The bathtub was filthy and the view was terrible. Never again will I waste my money at The Omni, and I will look at other websites to find better deals.", 
    "It was cool until some of the fixtures started to fall off in the room but for the most part it was cool", 
    "Wonderful room, excellent location. However, our room was not ready by the 3pm check in time. We had to wait another 2 hours until our room was ready. Staff wasn't that concerned with the problem and had no sense of urgency.", 
    "Great location and friendly staff but the condition of the rooms leave a lot to be desired. Parking is more expensive than other hotels and they charge for wifi. There are plenty of hotels that are much nicer and less expensive within a few blocks. ", 
    "Beautiful property with comfortable rooms and exceptional bed comfort.", 
    "A quick get away to visit Chicago before Christmas, location is great, convenient to shopping and restaurants. The room was spacious and very clean, the staff was extremely friendly and helpful from the doorman to the front desk. The breakfast buffet should not be missed, very tasty and high quality. We will return to this hotel on our next visit.", 
    "The hotel is getting a bit rundown. Our carpet was ripped, doors falling apart, wallpaper coming off the wall, tub fixtures not working well, etc...they can only put so much lipstick on it before they should repair things. The room was big and comfortable enough. The service was fine, but expected more from the concierge - not super helpful. The restaurant was fabulous! We will go back there even if we don't stay at the hotel.", 
    "This hotel is dated and urgently needs renovation. The double beds are small and uncomfortable.", 
    "Have stayed in Downtown Chicago for Christmas for the past 20 years but never at the Omni. Got a special rate for 3 nights and booked 4 rooms. The rooms were great since they had a separate area for the bedroom with a door between...was very handy. Only downside to the hotel was the parking rate...$65 + tax to park a car...which was about half of what the room rate was. That was crazy.", 
    "The hotel staff took great care of us. I think this was the highlight of the hotel. Our room was spacious. The hotel restaurant was great for dessert and drinks.", 
    "This hotel is located in the perfect spot - right in the middle of the Magnificent Mile. It was a little strange at first to not walk into a big hotel lobby, but it really wasn't a big deal to take the elevators up to the spacious lobby. The concierge was very helpful. The members of the hotel staff were all friendly. Everyone treated us like we were their only guest. The pool isn't huge, but it's perfect for a quick swim and the whirlpool is nice too! Overall though, our choice for this hotel was to be on the Magnificent Mile (which we had a view of from our room)...and this hotel was just perfect for everything we needed! It's close to everything and right in the center of the action. Loved it and would definitely stay here again!", 
    "I expected a little more attention to detail in a hotel of this rating (decor, overall cleanliness, soap dish in shower was not clean). But overall, a nice hotel.", 
    "Great location! Hotel is clean, restaurant is excellent and staff is friendly.", 
    "Everything was great. We had one issue though. We arrived late at about 1:00 am.We had already paid in full by credit card. We were surprised that the receptionist was rude. She said: \" Ididn't know you were coming!!! You have to wait for 20 mnts for me to get you a room\". We thought this was outrageous. You could give any message, but you can present it POLITELY!!! This is a very nice hotel and it would be a great idea to have nice and polite receptionist. When people come for vacations the last thing that they need is to deal with an impolite employee in their hotel.", 
    "We loved the location. My daughters loved having a pool at the hotel. We'll stay again.", 
    "A good hotel in a great location for shopping and business in Chicago. Stayed in a premium suite with wife and daughter right before Christmas. Hotel is a little dated in furnishings, but great staff and amenities.", 
    "Stayed 5 days during Christmas. Friendly stafff Fffff Differ Fffd", 
    "The staff at the hotel was phenomenal!!! Friendly, polite, helpful! We had a great stay!", 
    "The hotel was very conveniently located at the heart of Chicago's Magnificent Mile. The stores and restaurants we were interested in were just a few blocks away. We've stayed at many hotels over time, but the service here really stood out. It was little things like a polite staff, offering us complimentary use of umbrellas since we were going for a walk and it was raining or complimentary dvd rental. The lobby was beautiful and modern and I expected the same of our suite. However, though it was a very nice room, the carpet had a tear and I found a hair in the bathroom before it had been used by me. Overall, we had a great experience and would be happy to stay here again.", 
    "Really well organized and helpful. Great Christmas time help. ", 
    "I have stayed at the Omni in the past. Nice classy suites, Very comfy beds and furniture. I did need to call about batteries for one of the remotes. Housekeeping replaced them in minutes. Great room service menus for late at night.", 
    "The Omni consistently offers exceptional customer service, clean comfortable rooms, and the perfect location for a romantic getaway or family fun trip. The concierge is helpful, the front desk is friendly, the rooms are spacious and clean, and the location is perfect. The restaurant is very good, and the service is top notch. It is centrally located to shopping, restaurants, public transportation, and landmarks. I really can't say enough nice things about this hotel, I absolutely love it!!!", 
    "The Omni felt like being at home. Roomy and with a sitting area separate from the bedroom which makes for a just like being at home feeling. Staff was pleasant, attentive and accommodating.", 
    "my husband I I stayed at the Omni on a romantic getaway from the suburbs. The hotel staff were very friendly and accommadating- especially in regards to storing our luggage before and after checking in and out.", 
    "This was our second stay at the Omni. Once again, the staff was very friendly and we had outstanding service. The location on Michigan is great. The Omni is by far the most exceptional hotel we have stayed at in Chicago.", 
    "Beautiful room. Needs a better view. Great pool. Drinks too $$$", 
    "Nice hotel, great location, very friendly staff, nice exercise facility. Sign up for their loyalty program to get free Internet. Much cheaper parking available at 161chicago ave, about two blocks away. Use spot hero app/web site for best rates. ", 
    "My wife and I were in Chicago to do some Christmas shopping. The location of the Omni was perfect. The hotel is smack dab in the middle of the \"Mag-Mile\" and made getting to and from all the stores we wanted visit extremely convenient. There were a couple of drawbacks, though. Although the general hotel staff members were very pleasant, the wait staff in the hotel bar were slow and disengaged. We dropped by the bar to have a couple of drinks with a friend of my wife. The bar was fairly empty. We didn't get a waiter for nearly 10 minutes. The waiter finally showed up when I went to the bar to order drinks directly from the bartender. Then, we had to track him down each time we wanted another drink. Having worked in the hospitality business for a number of years, I'm abundantly aware of how important it is to create a positive consumer experience for guests. It's obvious that this philosophy has not been taught to the bar staff of the Omni. Onto the room. It was exactly as promised. Clean, spacious and looking over Michigan Ave. Great view. On the other hand, the room was EXTREMELY cold. Even with the heat placed at 84 degrees, the room would only reach a temperature of 63 degrees. Other than those two items, the Omni was a fantastic place to spend a couple of days to our kids inheritance on Christmas gifts for our granddaughter.", 
    "Mycket trevligt hotell till bra pris, centralt i Manchester.", 
    "Wonderful central location for shopping, NavyPier, Hancock, dining and night life. Desk staff and baggage handlers top notch. Best to just park car and Taxi to destinations.", 
    "This is the 4th or 5th time we have stayed at this hotel. It seems a little worn and the beds seemed a little worse for wear. I requested a week prior to arrival that a cake be in the room upon our arrival to celebrate a birthday and it wasn't there. I then asked about it, requested a later delivery time and it still wasn't there. It finally appeared after we returned from a late evening out. The location is excellent and other than the cake incident the staff is very friendly and accommodating (they even had umbrellas for us to use when it was raining). I also question the room size, I opted to spend a little more for a larger suite and the room we were put in wasn't as spacious as some of the others we had stayed in previously. If you need a hotel with a suite style set up and a fold out bed in a separate room this is a good choice.", 
    "Rooms are a bit dated but generally comfortable and nice. Very stately feel.", 
    "Room was very nice. I had to add a roll away bed and the only complaint would be is that the sheets were not very soft. ", 
    "Hotel was fully booked and there were many late check outs. Had to wait for room to be cleaned, the front desk made up for it by providing breakfast buffet coupons.", 
    "Beautiful hotel with great amenities. The bar was very nice and had a great drink selection. The hotel was in a convenient location for shopping and dining.", 
    "Very nice stay. Staff was superior and helpful.", 
    "Great location. The staff was wonderful. We enjoyed drinks at the bar. Food was amazing. The ONLY negative I would have if I had to give any would be that the pillows are very uncomfortable, however the bed itself was super comfortable. And the room was very dry. We both woke up with sore throats and stuffy noses. But overall the Omni was amazing. We will definitely be back.", 
    "While my experience at Omni Chicago wasn't exceptional, it did meet my expectation. Staff was friendly and efficient. Lobby was located on the second floor which you need to take the elevator to get to. If you arrive at a good time when concierge is not too busy, someone would direct you to the right place. During my stay I have encountered some lost/confused arriving guests looking for the well hidden lobby. Perhaps a little signage would help. Rooms was comfortable. I have no complaints with the bedding and linen. Internet is free if you register for their free selected guest program. ", 
    "We have stayed at this Omni countless times and we enjoy the staff and property every time. Kudos to the hotel restaurant revisions and management. Great upgrades and food quality. Now, about the room..the door thresholds underneath the doors are worn and the gaps allow so much hallway noise into the room. In addition, the doors close so loudly that the room vibrates. Not fun. We are from Florida and visited in Winter. We actually turned the heat off and had to open the windows to get a comfortable temperature in the room in order to sleep. Ceiling fan over bed may help? Our room needed a new mattress pronto, and new bedding. A good fitted sheet at the very least.", 
    "Everything lived up to expectations. Just wish that for a king suite there were at least a second chair, something a little more comfortable for the stay beside one desk chair. ", 
    "Went to Chicago for a family gathering at thanksgiving. Omni had a great location on magnificent mile.Hotel needs some updating which I was told was beginning shortly so it would be my top choice when that is completed", 
    "We had an initial minor issue with the TV in the bedroom. The hotel staff were prompt and courteous and very accommodating in moving us to another, even nicer suite. Love the location and the bar restaurant.", 
    "Very pleasant hotel great location Rooms starting to look a dated but clean and comfortable", 
    "A great hotel in a very central location, restaurants, shops, etc. Superb staff, willing to go that extra mile to make sure your stay is enjoyable. *Note* The Omni is ideal for people with allergies,.", 
    "Great hotel needs updated! The updates are scheduled to begin soon and should be completed by March. ", 
    "Location could not be better for shopping and sight seeing!", 
    "Very nice", 
    "We had a lovely stay at your hotel. Rooms were very comfortable and relaxing.....I would definitely stay at the Omni again.....", 
    "The refrigerator was hot and the TV in the bedroom wasn't working. The carpet in the room needed change because it was torn.", 
    "I'm a repeat customer, almost every time I go to Chicago I stay at this hotel. Location is great, service is excellent, rooms are clean. Ideal for the business traveler. Rooms are small suites. Great breakfast buffet for the price, great value. ", 
    "Excellent staff, makes for an enjoyable stay and they rate a 10. Facility show it in cleanliness, restaurant and bar service and front desk. Location gives access to Michigan Ave. even on a weather changing cold days in Nov. ", 
    "Good value for money", 
    "We stayed at the Omni for 5 nights and it was wonderful to have the extra space that the suite provided. The room was very functional and comfortable. We also took advantage of the fitness center and it was great! The staff was very helpful/pleasant. We have stayed at many hotels in the area and the Omni is my favorite.", 
    "I had a great stay at the Omni, would stay there again. Close to shopping and restaraunts.", 
    "We had an all around fabulous experience at Omni, from the bellman, front desk staff to the wonderful cleaning and maintence crew. Thank you Omni, we will be returning!", 
    "Having a suite is certainly a plus however the sliding doors between the bedroom and bathroom create both a lack of privacy and make a great deal of noise if using the bathroom in the middle of the night. Asked for a room on an upper floor. Ended up on the 10th floor with a view of an adjacent wall. Room was in need of an update. Overall not a bad stay but also not a particularly good value for the money.", 
    "Enjoyed the one night stay. Courteous staff, clean room and a huge King Suite for a reasonable price. Close to a lot of nice restaurants. Would definitely stay at the same hotel again", 
    "Love this place! Great location! Awesome Brunch A+", 
    "Great location on Michigan Avenue. Spacious rooms, very clean. Polite staff. I recommend it! The hotel does not have a lobby on the ground floor, small inconvenience, you have to take the elevator to the third floor lobby. Bring good earplugs, Michigan Avenue is very loud at night, but all the major hotels are in the same street.", 
    "Hotel staff was phenomenal, 676 restaurant was good also, server charlie is the best.", 
    "My stay was ok wish it could of been better since i went there to celebrate my birthday. When we got there they didnt have our room ready. We had to go sit in their restaurant and wait for 1 hour. They did give us a $30 voucher to use but we had dinner reservation somewhere else. We finally decided to go ask if we can get our room. They said they werent done cleaning it. We told them we had dinner reservation that we need to get ready for. So they finally gave us a room. When we got into the room my sister went to go take a shower and the towel felt like it was use already. We had to call house keeping for new towels and also on top of that we had to keep calling for our luggage to be sent to our room. Oh yeah there was still a light bulb they need to fix in our room and the guy kept coming in and out of our room. The top pillow was dusty. I think this should of been deal with before the weekend had started if they know they were going to be busy. Also the room should of been clean/fix before check in time. I dont think the stay there was worth $3xx.xx a night. I Wouldnt recommend this hotel to anyone.", 
    "Disappointed in accommodations. Coffee supplies in room sparse. Robes old & too small & i am smaller than average. Tv in bedroom from the 90's & terrible angle for someone laying in bed. Very uncomfortable couch. Room not cleaned ubtil 4:30pm.", 
    "Rude and unhelpful staff. Outdated and unclean rooms. Only positive is location but many other hotels nearby to chose from.", 
    "Bed was comfortable but should be a King. Closet too small/ short. Bedding was great but ceiling too low. I loved the suite so I can read while others sleep. TV in bedroom was an antique. Everything very clean. ", 
    "We were booked into what appeared to be a \"handicapped room\" that was suite. Nice and roomy. The only complaint was the small closet hanging rack was very low and there was a large privacy safe below it. There was almost no room to hang clothes so we hung some on bathroom wall hooks. Other than that the location and amenities were great.", 
    "Went for Pack Expo. Great location. Very dated hotel. Staff was outstanding. They are remodeling the staff said this winter.", 
    "great location, clean, staff was very friendly.", 
    "Wonderful stay in Chicago. We arrived early in the morning and a room was available. We enjoyed the some shopping and restaurants. We took the train into the city from O'Hare but used Uber for our return. ", 
    "Rooms are much smaller than they seem in the pictures... especially on Expedia, the pictures are very flattering. Furniture/Amenities are outdated. Valet staff is warm and friendly, everyone else gives off the 'big city, I don't care, Chicago attitude'. Given a towel with a chewing gum-like substance on it. Overall not worth the money or hassle. I expected much more from downtown Chicago. ", 
    "We stayed at this hotel for 3 nights & had a great trip. The location is so perfect central to everything. We didn't use our car the entire time we were able to walk or grab a short cab ride. The hotel staff was very accomodating & attentive to our requests. The room decor is starting to get a bit dated but not a big deal. ", 
    "Quick overnight trip. Stayed in double bed suite with 4 people total. Very close to lots of things. Hotel was comfortable and nice. If you are looking for great city views, then probably not your place. Very nice end of town. Always felt safe. Parking a little tricky but not bad for Chicago.", 
    "Omni tends to be a great but perhaps too often overlooked option in downtown Chicago. Having stayed in probably 20 Chicago hotels over the past 10-15 years, many higher end, I think the Omni is a great intersection of comfort, location, service, and price. Particularly if you are part of their loyalty program, little things like free internet (which should really be routine just about everywhere but isn't), complimentary coffee/tea/juice service in the morning (delivered to your door), and other small amenities put the Omni very near the top of my most favored places to stay, at least if I'm paying for it.", 
    "Great location, hotel charges are quite high for drinks and food - but plenty of places to eat out", 
    "The Omni was perfect in every way for our stay..we had a room on the 25th floor..amazing views.! The hotel was in easy reach of shops of every kind, restaurants, bars and places of interest. The room was most comfortable and the housekeeping staff called each evening to offer extra supplies. The bar and restaurant facilities were convenient and very nice..and while we did not have a chance to use the leisure facilities .. it was a nice option at the hotel. The hotel staff were efficient, courteous and most helpful at all times. Altogether our experience was very positive and we would highly recommend the Omni when visiting Chicago.", 
    "Couples weekend get away. Always enjoy Michigan Ave and surrounding area. The staff at the hotel were nice. The room could use some updating/remodeling. Overall a nice stay at a competitive rate.", 
    "This is an amazing downtown hotel. You can walkout to the best of Chicago. Food shopping gakkeries. Why the parking is twice what it cost locally to park. ", 
    "A return trip. Love the hotels location!", 
    "dirty. needed cleaned once we saw condition. super expensive even for basic coffee in the morning. $3 for small cup, no refill or even refresh. Small bottle of water in room = $10.00. Tube TV in the room....no really, a TUBE TV. What a joke", 
    "Great overall!", 
    "My daughter and I were impressed with the Omni hotel and staff. We were even more impressed and honored when we saw that they offer gluten free options on their in-room dining menus. This was very helpful with our food restriction needs. We will be back!", 
    "Awesome", 
    "Great location, Nice staff, attractive price.", 
    "We've stayed at this property many times over the past 10-12 years. If anything, the management and condition has improved with age!", 
    "Great location to all shopping and POI near Magnificent Mile. Beautiful Contemporary rooms,with comfortable beds. Great flat screen TV in living area need similar in the bedrooms, and perhaps a more comfortable chair.", 
    "Hotel stay was fine but rooms are overpriced for what you get. I was disappointed in ambiance and lack of any extras. Paying $400+/night should at least buy you free wireless access. Would not stay here again for the price.", 
    "This hotel is very well located on North Michigan Ave. The room was big and comfortable. We did not eat in the hotel, we preferred to eat out including breakfast so I cannot comment on the food. Check in staff were polite and helpful. I would definitely recommend this hotel for its great location.", 
    "Great to everything and great location. All personel where very greeting and was safe. By far the best hotel I've stayed at. The most beautiful views of River North you can ever see unless you live in a condo high rise in the area. It gives you a new perspective of how beautiful Chicago is.", 
    "Very nice neighborhood would stay here again!!! My only suggestion room s are dark.", 
    "This was a three day sight seeing stopover. We had a suite on high floors which had a nice view and was very comfortable and quiet. Room servicing was a bit erratic. Two days theturn down service appeared far too early. We were not given water each day, and twice had to ask for tea and coffee to be replaced as it had been forgotten. Valet parking at the hotel costs an eye watering $60 a day, so self park in the garage on the next block for $34 a day providing you are leaving your car in the garage and not going in and out. Get a bus pass from Wallgreen's a few yards across the road for $10/15 a day and use the bus and rail loop to get round town. Its very easy and avoids parking problems when at the sights. Restaurant in the hotel had limited and rather dull sounding menu, but we did eat there one evening, and in reality the food tasted great.", 
    "Great location, everything within walking distance - shopping, great pizza, Portillo's for hot dogs and Italian beef, Holy Name Cathedral, the Bean...everythingust about! Nice little bar, attentive service, very sweet ladies who take care of our room.", 
    "my stay was not very good even close to terrible. I was given a room that did not have closet space for me to hang of my suits, slacks or jacket. On returning to my room the first night of my stay I found my door a jarred. On the second night I did not have a plastic cover for the ice bucket. I went down to the front desk and asked the manager for one. He said they would send it right up. I never got one even though I stayed two more days. The hotel was too expensive for these experiences", 
    "Loved it. Our room was large and very comfortable. Great bar/lounge area.", 
    "The Omni was perfectly located on Michigan Ave for our tourist purposes. We could easily walk or take the bus to all of our destinations. They even offered us a ride whenever we got ready to walk out of the door. The doorman could not have been nicer or more helpful!", 
    "Had a quick over night stay- great hotel! The restaurant was very enjoyable and we had a fantastic meal there. Only 1 compkaint- $65 valet parking.", 
    "The Location docent get better. Right in the Middle of High Street Shopping and close to some great restaurants.", 
    "Four of us met in Chicago from Michigan and Oregon. WE needed a suite, because we did not want to sit on beds all of the time. The room was nice. We felt that there could be another comfortable chair, so all of us could be comfortable. The location was GREAT!", 
    "Overall great stay. The hotel is right in the center of the \"magnificant mile\" making it easy to get just about anywhere. I walked everywhere I needed to go. There were several nice restuarants in the area. The hotel's restaurant looked very nice and had a very interesting menu, although I did not eat there. Hotel seemed pretty standard for a 4 star. All rooms were suites, which makes them seem a little bigger. I did not get a chance to check out the hotel's pool or gym. The front desk staff, bellhops, and maids were all very nice and provided good service. I would stay here again", 
    "The Omni Chicago is an excellent, all-suite hotel located on the Magnificent Mile. A perfect location to explore/discover Chicago! We stayed 4 nights and had a great experience.", 
    "Overall the stay was very nice. It was a great choice to celebrate our anniversary and the chocolate cake was wonderful.", 
    "The hotel was in a great location. The staff was friendly. The hotel was nice, but had a corporate feel. Overall a decent stay for a weekend.", 
    "My husband and I decided to stay at the Omni because it is central to everything in Chicago. I have been to other Omni hotels and was really expecting it to be top notch. I was wrong. The decor is very outdated. The room was a decent size and I liked the separate living area and wet bar but again, it just was completely unattractive. The reason my ratings were somewhat harsh is as follows: they do not put fitted sheets over their mattresses.. or they didn't in our room at least. There is literally nothing grosser than waking up laying on a BARE HOTEL MATTRESS. Absolutely disgusting. I have traveled a bit and never encountered that.", 
    "This hotel needs to be renovated, we were very disappointed by the appearance of our room and the staff were not able to offer us a room of a more modern appearance. They offered us to switch, which we did, but even the room offered was still very tired looking.", 
    "The Omni is beautiful, the service is great, the location was perfect for us. The only negative for us was the length of time it took for the valey to retrieve our car, even with advance calling, we waited 15+minutes each time.", 
    "This by far was the best hotel we have stayed at off Michigan Avenue. Food, shopping, nightlife were all within walking distance. Will definitely be back!", 
    "We were pleased with our stay at Omni Chicago Hotel in late September, 2014. I am allergic to Down feathers and requested special bedding. Fortunately, the Omni has an entire floor for such situations. (the 21st floor).The room was clean, comfortable, and had a lovely partial view of the Lake and the surrounding area. The staff was so helpful and friendly.", 
    "This was the best stay. We were close to everything and the everyone at the hotel was exceptionally nice. We will definitely stay here again or rather every time we are in Chicago", 
    "Close to theaters and restaurants which is why we went downtown.", 
    "This was an expensive hotel. ln the end it seemed like I got ripped off. There are certainly better options. It wasn't bad, just didn't seem worth the money to me.", 
    "Great location, big and comfortable room. Would stay there again. The rug in our room could was a bit worn. Overall, great hotel.", 
    "En general muy buena", 
    "My husband and I recently stayed at the Omni for a short honeymoon trip. We enjoyed our stay immensely. The room was clean and comfortable. The concierge service helped us get tickets to the Shedd Aquarium so we would not have to wait in line. When the hotel concierge found out it was our honeymoon, they sent up complimentary champagne, chocolates and a lovely handwritten congratulatory note. The location was wonderful, right on Michigan Ave and near all the shops and restaurants we could need. If we needed to go anywhere farther away we just grabbed a taxi. It was no further than 15 min ride to most of the attractions. The only downside at all was that the bed was a bit hard for us, but we love super soft mattresses. We loved our stay!", 
    "We had a wonderful stay at the Omni Chicago. The rooms were very clean and staff was extremely helpful. We had to ask for towels a couple of times, but delivery was very prompt and everyone was very friendly. The pool was great and we wished we had more time to enjoy the relaxing environment!", 
    "My room was a small suite which was comfortable with dull furnishings. Wireless network connectivity was inconsistent and sometimes poor. Completely unusable in the bedroom. Lack of accessible power points in the bedroom and the living room unless you sat at the desk. I had room service a few times and the food was very good. It is an excellent location. I found the staff were mostly disinterested although the porters and doormen were very good. ", 
    "This location is unbeatable. It is right off Michigan avenue. The service was great and the hotel was very clean. I am surprised that they still have tube TVs in the bedroom, however, this had no impact on our trip. There wasn't sufficient space to hang our dress clothes either. All in all, I would stay again!", 
    "The only thing bad is they only offer coffee until 6:30 am at the lobby. I had a 7 am departure so I have to buy coffee? I had used the one in the room the night before and there was not a maids cart out to get another one in the morning.", 
    "Great location and very friendly staff! Bathrooms are a little dated and cramped in the rooms but otherwise the room was very nice. Enjoyed our stay! Loved the noon check out!", 
    "When I first arrived I had several bags, it took me 2 trips to get my bags from the taxi to the curb. 3 employees stood there and watched me and they were having a pleasant conversation. It took me 2 more trips to get my bags from the curb to the hotel lobby, where the person behind the front desk directed me to an elevator and told me I had to check in on the 3rd floor. The bellman was standing next to her and watched me once again make 2 trips from the lobby to the elevator and on my second back asked me if I needed help, which by this time I was almost done, so I declined his help. Once checked in and made my 2 trips again to another elevator from the front desk and made 2 trips from the second elevator to my room (since the bellman must have been too busy talking with the 3 men talking at the curb as 1 blew his whistle flagging down a unseen cab. Once in the room, the room was clean but the carpet was old and frayed, the wet bar wasn't stocked, the occasional chairs were nasty dirty on the armrest. I had to put a towel on the chair before I dared to sit down. I would not recommend spending your money at this hotel, I travel to Chicago a lot and there are much nicer hotels on the Mag Mile for less money.", 
    "I only stayed one night, but was oferal a great experience. Will definitely return.", 
    "I was looking for a hotel in the area within a reasonable price and this one fulfilled my expectations.", 
    "went to the fitness center and the treadmills(5) did'nt work properly. mentioned to the front desk. desk clerk said she would report to engineering and next day same problem. need new machines. also a couple days there was no water in the fitness center. whirlpool/spa timer didnt work properly. Once set it just kept on going and going and going. reported this to front desk as well, to no avail. Room was ok. Nothing spectacular. This hotel used to be a real 4 star hotel dont know what happened over the last 5-10 years.", 
    "Everything was perfect", 
    "I guess we got a pretty good deal coming into Chicago at the end of labor day weekend. We booked two days (Sunday and Monday), and were really happy with the price and the quality and size of our room. The bathroom was very large, and our room had a separate bedroom area from the other rooms. We decided to stay in Chicago another day, but when I went down to pay, the price jumped a hundred bucks...on a tuesday?!?!? They wouldn't budge at all, so we went around the corner and got a really nifty room for half the nightly rate we paid for each of the first two nights at Omni. Hotel pricing is weird.", 
    "Very nice!!! Staff was so nice!! Room was nice!!", 
    "Nice hotel in a great location in the middle of the Magnificent Mile.", 
    "Nice hotel next to Magnificent Miles shops, restaurants, bars and Michigan lake beach.", 
    "Sadly this visit wasn't like past ones. After waiting 30 minutes in our room they brought us someone else's luggage, the tv was broken and the superior corner suite was very small and noisy. I could hear every sound coming from the neighbors. When we were leaving they forgot to bring our car around. Prior visits were so much better. They just didn't seem to be on their game.", 
    "Great view, good size room, and housekeeping was okay. I understand she might of been upset for having to come at our door a couple of times before getting an answer, but upon our return to the room, pillows were everywhere and not on the bed as they should had been. I guess that was her way of saying she was upset with us.", 
    "The hotel is very well located for shopping. That being said, I wouldn't recommend it for more than a night or two at the most. We stayed 4 nights. It was too long for a hotel that turned out to be pretty funky. Reception area is on third floor, first floor just has someone pointing you to the elevators. Guests have to take two elevators in two different locations every time they want to go downstairs, weird room layout -- bathroom was almost half the suite and no door or curtain over toilet area. Rooms were quite noisy with guests running and yelling in hallways (this may be because there are so many kids in the hotel due to the American Girl store located nearby). Internet was a separate charge every day, refrigerator was unusable for guests except to buy commodities with the usual high prices, plus tax and \"restocking\" fees on every item. We felt nickled and dimed. This hotel would do better to not advertise as \"luxury.\" It's an OK hotel that's quite expensive in a great part of town.", 
    "This hotel is very much right in the middle of all the action on the Magnificent Mile (Michigan Ave). Lots of great restaurants, shopping and attractions are within walking distance. The hotel was overall clean and comfortable. However, the carpet right in front of the elevators on the first floor is very dirty and it really needs to be replace.", 
    "The Omni Chicago is centrally located on the Magnificent Mile but it isn't noisy. The hotel is smart - the staff polite and very helpful. The pool and spa centre are a great bonus. I would definitely recommend the hotel.", 
    "I really enjoyed the hotel. It was convenient to everything we wanted to do. Our room, unfortunately, backed up to a service elevator; which I would hear every morning. The bed was not as comfortable as I would have liked. Overall, the hotel was nice.", 
    "The AC return air was caked with dust and there was hair found on the bathroom floor. Interenet acess was not free as in many other hotels.", 
    "Very friendly staff & great service. Location is walking distance to many tourist attractions downtown. The pool and workout area is a bit on the small side but very clean. Overall it was a happy stay and recommend staying here for its great location.", 
    "From the minute we got there until we left everything was was perfect.", 
    "Room service was delicious and our in room couples massage was fantastic!", 
    "The location was nice, sofa bed was ok. Wifi only free after signing up with their Loyalty program, even then it got billed and it took me some effort to get it refunded.", 
    "We stayed 3 nights and found the hotel to be an excellent base from which to explore the city. It has several restaurants nearby.", 
    "Everything about this hotel was perfect. The staff was attentive and extremely helpful. The concierge got us VIP tickets for the aquarium the day before--what a boon! The location was spectacular, right smack in the middle of the Magnificent Mile. You could throw a stone at Niketown, it was that close!", 
    "Great hotel. Within short walking or taxi journey distance to all the main attractions. Staff very helpful and friendly. ", 
    "Awesome location, excellent service and decent clean rooms - no complains at all....if I were to visit Chicago again it would be omni hotel. No doubt about it!", 
    "We loved the Omni and would return.Great staff, Clean quiet rooms and ice cold lemonade waiting in the foyer when you return to the hotel.", 
    "Omni Is fine. Nothing fancy but clean enough and excellent location", 
    "We liked almost everything about the hotel. The location was great - less than 100 feet off of the Magnificent Mile. Nice hotel and good sized rooms. The only thing we found strange were the elevators - you had to take one elevator from the street to the lobby and then switch to another bank of elevators to get to the floor that your room was on. They were also on the small side and felt cramped at times when there were other passengers. All in all we had a very pleasant stay.", 
    "The hotel is located in the heart of the city and very convenient. We stayed for three nights and would definitely stay here again. It was clean, updated, spacious and the staff was extremely helpful.", 
    "This is an ideal location for downtown access. Rooms are clean and spacious - beginning to look in need of a refresh. Service good - breakfast good, if a little on the expensive side.", 
    "Great location on Michigan avenue. Convenient to a bus stop that took us to the museum campus, museum of science and industry, and the Navy pier. Also only a few blocks from a red line station. Will definitely stay at again. Never ate at the restaurant in the hotel though. Seemed pricey to me especially with so many great Chicago restaurants close by.", 
    "Loved hotel. But didn't like having to take 2 elevators. Registration area should be more impressive. Loved everything about hotel ", 
    "We stayed 3 nights in Chicago and this hotel was central to everything and walking distance. The room and service was very good. It was very spacious. My daughter didn't get to use the pool as it was either closed or too crowded. It was also too small for the number of guests and it didn't look to clean - the only disappointment with this hotel.", 
    "The room was clean and comfortable, and the staff were really nice. Loved the layout of the room - very convenient if one of you is an early riser and the other is not! The restaurant was pricey (breakfast for 2 with tip ran $60), but was good. We opted to eat outside of the restaurant for the rest of the trip. Try L'Appetito (in the lower courtyard of the Hancock Tower) for breakfast or lunch. Great food, very reasonable prices (full breakfast, without beverage, was $5.50).", 
    "my friends and I stayed at the Onmi Chicago Aug I was a fantastic hotel in the heart of Chicago. Convenient to everything from shopping to food to a short subway ride to Wrigley. SPECIAL shout out to the hotel bar. Absolutely fabulous service and very charming young lady!!!", 
    "Stayed 2 adults and 2 children ages 13/10 booked bigger room with sofa bed and 2 queens worked out well. Good location for John Hancock centre and pier metro easiest for city art and went to white socks game on metro. Kids liked pool and gym in hotel. Recommend hiring cycles from along the river and then cycling south down lakeside. Car parking ultra expensive at hotel so we picked up vehicle for rest of our trip at Alamo downtown after checking out of hotel which worked out well "

    "It seemed a bit bland when we checked in - we stayed 4 nights and liked it more each day. The location is very handy - can walk to everything downtown, and the pool, while short, is marked for swimming laps and the pool room is very nice. Even when there were a few kids in the pool, there was still room to swim laps, which is nice because most hotels have a pool so narrow that you can't have multiple users. Didn't like not having a refrigerator in the room that we could use, and had a glass of wine at the bar that was $15, so bought a bottle after that. Enjoyed the trip. ", 
    "During my recent stay, I noticed my duvet cover had makeup smudges. I called guest services and requested mine be changed. Not only did I receive a new duvet cover, but the head of housekeeping changed it personally. He also provided a voucher for breakfast in one of the hotel's restaurants! He went the extra mile to correct the situation, which I truly appreciated! ", 
    "Great location, great river viewing rooms, but the hotel is very old", 
    "This hotel is extremely nice. We loved the view from our room and the pool. It is fun to watch all the boats on the river. ", 
    "We stayed two nights and really enjoyed it. The room was very comfortable - good size beds and great bedding. Ample space. Very quiet!", 
    "Very nice! Close to the NBC studio which we had tickets to the Steve Harvey Show.", 
    "The hotel is very conveniently located near millennium park and the river and has a nice view of the city. However, I thought that for the price you pay, you should at least have wifi connection. ", 
    "Room was comfortable and the beds very comfortable. The riverside location meant that all of the key sites were accessible on foot. Overall a pleasant experience.", 
    "Perfect to vacation meting close all you want to do", 
    "Good location. A lot of nice restaurants and bars in the area. Used taxi to travel back and forth from the airport so cannot say much about accessibility to public transportation. Courteous and helpful staff. ", 
    "I very much enjoyed my stay, I went with 3 other guests for leisure. The hotel staff was very inviting and friendly. The staff upgraded our check-out time from noon to 1pm and have us free in-room internet (versus the $14.95 charge). The hotel room was somewhat small, we stayed in the traditional 2 bed room. The view was amazing and the beds were very comfortable! ", 
    "It was very hot in our room. Called the front desk and they sent maintenance, but they said there was nothing they could do. It was set on 66, but wouldn't go past 72 so it was very hot to us. Besides that hotel was good. Expensive, but you pay for the view. ", 
    "Fine; great location and view. Guests should have access to microwave and more refrigerator space. ", 
    "Enjoyed our stay - class act, as I expect Sheratons to be!", 
    "It was our first time visit to Chicago. We were really happy with the hotel. Comfortable beds and very clean. The entire staff was awesome!!!!", 
    "Beautiful view and comfy room! We enjoyed our stay. The items in the room were pricey, but that's the case everywhere. We had a river view and it was beautiful. ", 
    "I love to travel n it was a great experience. The hotel was great ", 
    "The majority of the staff was pleasant and the room was comfortable. The view of downtown Chicago was great. The package we purchased included breakfast for the four of us for all four days of our stay, and a fridge in our room. When we checked in, we found out that this was not the case. Four days of breakfast for four people. You do the math. We also had to pay extra for the fridge (all of this was said to be included when we made our reservations). The bathtub was drained extremely slow, so we showered in about a foot of dirty water the entire time. Fortunately they have showers at the pool. This was our first family vacation, so the above mentioned was a bit disappointing, but overall, we had a great time in Chicago.", 
    "We brought our daughter to Chicago for the first time and she LOVED it!! We will be back this summer for sure.", 
    "Hot in the room. Good location. Pool closed at ten which we thought should of been open later. No free wifi or breakfast", 
    "A nice walk to shops and restaurants. Well cared for. Excellent service. Nice pool and fitness center. Good for families or business.", 
    "i took my family to chicago for a cubs game and we spent the night before at the sheraton. beautiful building and very courteous staff.", 
    "It is a very nice hotel with a great location in downtown Chicago. It is so close to the Park, a walking distance to the park, to the shopping center and to the AMC theater. It will be perfect if it has the hot tub. ", 
    "Location was wonderful for seeing the Chicago sights. Our room was very clean and had a great view of the city. Staff was friendly and helpful. Valley parking was convenient and the gentlemen who brought our car each time were courteous and friendly!", 
    "Before retiring, I often stayed in this hotel on business. It always was a pleasant experience. Since that ws more than ten years ago, we were very happy to find that it had not declined in any way. Our room had obviously been recent refurbished and was in excellent condition. Although we had booked it for a very reasonable price, we were pleased to find that it was a corner room with lots of space and a couch and easy chair. Most outstanding was the staff; from the front desk clerk to the maid who showed me where the ice machine was, every staff member we met was courteous, pleasant and anxious to help us. What a pleasure. Located close to the loop and to N. Michigan Ave, this is a perfect place to sat in downtown Chicago. ", 
    "Clean, good location, walk to Navy Pier, easy check in.", 
    "Took a short two night trip to Chicago. The hotel and rooms were nice and well kept. The hotel staff was somewhat helpful although boarderline annoying. The location of the hotel was mediocre at best. It was very hard to get to with one way streets and also very difficult to bring a car from the parking garage to the front of the hotel. Parking would be one of my biggest complaints because I have never stayed at a hotel even in NYC and Atlanta, also big cities, where parking was not provided for hotel guests. At this hotel, parking was $52 per night for a total of $102 in parking for my trip. What's worse is that I was not told about this cost ahead of time so that I could find alternatives. They also tried to charge me for using the minibar which I did not use and tried to double charge me for parking. All charges were eventually straightened out but it was a huge hassle overall.", 
    "Great staff, nice location & very clean! My only complaint is that there weren't any quick food options. A cafe that serves sandwiches and coffee would be a great addition! ", 
    "Hotel was very nice, staff friendly, rooms clean and spacious.", 
    "Got a great deal for this excellent hotel, walking distance to Navy Pier, Giordano's Pizzeria and Macy's in Michigan Ave. The view at night from the room was espectacular, the river, the boats in the river, the skycrapers, a totsl dream!", 
    "It was a family friendly environment. The staff were prompt and willing to help out with anything. ", 
    "Looking for a hotel in the heart of Chicago can be tough when looking for a budget friendly, family friendly hotel with a pool. We found one in the Sheraton Chicago Hotel & Towers. The pool was perfect for our kids to play and burn energy while offering a great view of the river and city. Also the pool was open early, so our early rising kids could go swimming at 7 am. Our room was spacious and we got a great deal on it. The hotel staff did a great job and we will definitely make this hotel our first choice if ever visiting the windy city again.", 
    "There was no problem with the room itself or the staff, but they do try to squeeze as much money as possible out of you. To park in their garage is $61 a night. $14 per day to access the internet in your room. There is a mini-fridge packed full of drinks. The fridge has sensors so that if you remove anything you will immediately be charged a very high price. It is impossible to put any of your own food or drink into the fridge. If you even remove what they have in there, you will be charged $25. We paid $200 a night for the room, but will all the additional unexpected fees, it came to closer to $300 a night. I would not stay here again. ", 
    "Awesome location, big hotel, comfy beds. A little disappointed for being \"punished\" by Sheraton for not booking directly through them. See no reason why that should affect me getting Starwood points.", 
    "Great hotel. Would be better if they removed the over priced snacks from the room. I hate wondering what I can and can't touch in the hotel room because I don't know if I'll be charged. It isn't convenient having them in the room and is clearly a way for the hotel to make money. ", 
    "it was nice, quiet, clean, excellent location and close to many sightseeing, price was reasonable.", 
    "Easy in easy out, quick stay. Nice place, pool for kids. Everything was great.", 
    "It was ok. Checking in was not welcoming at all. A positive is their rooms were good and clean. I don't approve of having to travel down another set of elevators to get with Valet and then get my car. For the daily fee of Valet parking I would expect to pick up my car up front and greeted a little better not in a dingy garage. I have pretty high expectations for this hotel due to it's location, name, and price. I've had better experiences at other hotels in Chicago. Sorry.", 
    "The only thing negative that happened was that on check-in the person who checked us in said we have to sign up for the internet and it says you have to pay, but the charges will come off at the end of your stay. It sounded suspicious and that was not true.", 
    "Neighbor had very loud dog in room next to us. Only complaint ", 
    "Rooms were very nice, comfortable bed, very clean over the 5 days we stayed there. The fitness centre and pool were very well equipped and clean and had a great view. Downside was that we couldn't keep any personal food or drink items in the fridge because, if any mini-bar items were removed, a sensor was triggered to charge the room for the item. An empty fridge could be rented but I felt that the rental fee was an exhorbitant price over 5 days. Also, there was free wireless internet available in the lobby, but there was a charge for wireless connection in the hotel rooms. I also felt this service was overpriced. The last inconvenience was the availability of restaurants in the hotel. The bistro downstairs was very nice and the breakfast food was great but it was only open for breakfast and lunch. The only restaurant in the hotel available for evening dining was the steak house, which was also very nice, and the food was excellent, but the cost of our dinner there was the same price as the room rate for 2 nights. However, the room service menu was a good value and there was a variety of food offered. ", 
    "Didn't like the fact that they have a mini-bar instead of a fridge and if you take anything out of it you are automatically charged even if you put it back. No iron or ironing board either. Also did not like that almost everything on the TV was pay per view.", 
    "The hotel is well located and the staff is friendly. The lake view is amazing. Prices are fair. ", 
    "I stayed at the hotel for a weekend away with friends. The staff was very friendly & helpful when I inquired about places to see and eat. They even had walking instructions typed up to get to the places in walking distance. I would definitely stay there again.", 
    "Very nice modern hotel. Good location to shopping, Navy pier and the river north area. We were warmly welcomed and given a nice view from our room. Very clean with nice workout facilities, pool and I loved the dry sauna in the lockerroom. We stayed three days and housekeeping was excellent and all staff very friendly. The bed was SUPER comfortable. WOW. Picky things that can add up quickly - The \"goodies\" in the room on a tray were outrageously priced. If you just picked one up to look at it, a sensor automatically bills the item to your room. So be warned. Also, you are not told at check in that internet wi-fi is an extra $15 per day so unless you want to use it in your room, turn off the wifi on your smart phone after you get off the elevator. Room service very pricey and we took a pass on it. All and all we enjoyed our stay and will return.", 
    "easy access to miracle mile.", 
    "Great location, parking was easy.", 
    "Super comfortable room-the bed was amazing! The staff was incredibly helpful and friendly.", 
    "Great hotel and good location. Would stay there again.", 
    "First time to Chicago..Great location. Super comfy bed..I would stay again and recommend it to friends and family..", 
    "Wonderful had a fun and relaxing time Very fast guest service chek in and good service recommend it!", 
    "Wanted a king room and received a double", 
    "Overall, nice please to stay for a couple day trip. Luckily I am a SPG member, and I did not had to deal with wifi fees, but if you are not get ready to pay some extra commodities that are free in other places. Another turn-down, is everything is quite expensive there... breakfast is not included, room services are \"crazy expensive.\" ", 
    "Our beautiful, expansive room had two flaws. The toilet wouldn't shut off after each flush, and I had to get up and jiggle the handle all night long. (My husband and I are 'frequent flyers' at night). Also, the water in the sink was sometimes slow to go down. Ick. Do hotels save flawed rooms for discount customers?", 
    "We have stayed at many hotels in our travels but none compare to the feeling we get staying at the Sheraton. It is like our home away from home.", 
    "I stayed here with my wife for her birthday weekend and it was incredible. We ate at Shula's Steakhouse on Friday night, which is located inside the hotel. The view from our room was amazing, and the entire staff was very courteous. We will definitely be returning.", 
    "There was no gift shop or vending machines available to purchase small items. The parking fees were very expensive and the conceirge desk were poorly informed and did not give correct information. Outside that the main desk personnel were excellent and the room and hotel in general were very nice and clean.", 
    "Amazing is a great hotel everything it was perfect the room smell great", 
    "Definitely try to get a Club Level Room!", 
    "Wonderful", 
    "The room was very clean and comfortable with a good view of the city. There was only one single chair besides the bed and a big empty space that could have been filled with at least another chair since there were two of us and a toddler that would have been nice. Loved the gym and swimming pool.", 
    "Close to magnificent mile. Easy to navigate around. No gift shop or vending machines. Had to walk to Walgreens for drinks or snack so we didn't have to pay the outrageous price to eat or drink from room.", 
    "I go to Chicago several times a year for leisure and stay at this Sheraton. I have always been very pleased with the quality of the rooms and facilities. It's proximity to Michigan Avenue, the Chicago River and Lake Michigan make it very walkable in good weather. ", 
    "Absolutely terrific stay. Enjoyed the mid week quiet. Had the pool to myself both days but would sure have enjoyed a hot tub after skating at Millennium park! Like the option to go green and pass on housekeeping since I was there for such a short time. Exceedingly friendly staff! The only thing that might keep me away next time would be to find a hot tub!", 
    "Front desk staff was extremely helpful The view from room very good and I love the shampoo and conditioner ", 
    "Beautiful hotel with such a lovely view and friendly staff.", 
    "Had a good stay in this hotel. They accommodated an early check in as i came off the train and staff were always courteous and friendly. It is a busy hotel and i did find that the interconnecting doors between rooms were not the best at dampening sound so you could hear everything happening in the next room, and I mean everything;). Apart from the noise issue the hotel delivered everything that was expected.", 
    "We stayed at the Sheraton Hotel for five nights to welcome the New Year. We got a great rate, considering their facilities and great location, just blocks aways from Magnificent Mile, Millennium Park and Navy Pier. The highlight of our stay: our view! Upon arrival, we were offered to join the hotel's Preferred Guest and were instantly upgraded to a room with a wonderful view to the river and the Trump tower. I would definitely recommend to stay at this Sheraton Hotel.", 
    "Our stay was pleasant. The room was very clean and well-decorated. It's a little disappointing to not have complimentary wireless internet like so many other hotels we have visited, but I knew going in that we wouldn't have it. I will say that the hotel seemed more geared to business travel and didn't really have that homey, personal feel that I prefer, but for the money, we felt like we got a great deal on a nice hotel in downtown Chicago close to restaurants and shopping.", 
    "reservations are not really much of a reservation, was put in a handicap-accessible room hotel is close to lots of places and managed the holiday crowds well (stayed over New Year's eve)", 
    "Hotel muito bem localizado. Bom atendimento. Muito bonito.", 
    "Perfect location, comfy bed, great pool, amazing front desk staff and free parking. Did I mention FREE PARKING! Great weekend get away.", 
    "Service at the hotel was excellent we had a baby and some needs that came along with the baby. The hotel got us a fridge and other items for no charge", 
    "Chicago is an amazing city and the Sheraton was an excellent hotel. The room was clean and nice and the people working the front desk were super friendly. My only negative are those little things in the rooms that have the snacks that if taken of the sensor are chared outrageously priced, to your room. We didn't use them, but they're really shady and lame.", 
    "Loved my stay. Nice hotel without being stuffy. Enjoyable lobby to spend time in. Only complaint was the bellman was very forward in expecting a tip. It was very uncomfortable and made me not want to give one but he pretty much forced me to...personal space buddy!", 
    "The hotel is clean and always friendly. Staff members are always there to help whenever needed too. When going to the city this is my choice of stay every time.", 
    "I love this hotel. The room was nice and clean, comfortable bad, everybody was helpful and friendly. Conserge gave us very good advice for places to eat and different attractions. The view and location perfect, everything close, easy with public transportation. I would recomend my friends.", 
    "Although it was New Years Eve and there was a lot of commotion in the hallways until about 2:00 in the morning, I'm sure circumstances are a lot different on other dates. My date and I were happy with the closeness of the restaurants and other available sites of the city to this hotel. We will be sure to be back.", 
    "It was good overall no complaints", 
    "Rude staff, and the rooms are way to small, bath to small", 
    "Great location, friendly staff, beautiful hotel. Only complaint is no fridge in the room for personal left overs, etc (only held mini bar items).", 
    "The front desk staff was super accommodating allowed us for early check in on 3 rooms. Always great when traveling with kids!", 
    "The hotel could have been cleaned better during housekeeping visits and the draining wasn't so great in the shower which was kind of disgusting. The hotel itself is gorgeous and loved the location. ", 
    "Nice hotel near Millennium Park. Enjoyed the bakery for breakfast. Convenient and relaxing!", 
    "Great place , especially for such a good price. Room thermostat didn't seem to work well, room got a little warm.", 
    "It was a great location-everything was great except we had to wait until 6:00 Chicago time to check in-we arrived at 12 noon Chicago time and they said they would text me when ready-I called two times and they said not ready finally they texted me, Very upsetting-also a glass was in the hallway for 4 days the 5th day it was gone-not up to Sheraton Standards.", 
    "My kids and I were coming to Chicago from the north west suburbs for the day. While looking for places to go, came across a hotel deal we could not pass on. The Sheraton was the best choice. Location, ammenities and cost sealed the deal. Great decision.", 
    "Bed and pillows were too soft for me and my wife. Overall is a good hotel with good location. I travel with my kids and it was great.", 
    "Great location for a 3 nights stay over New Years.", 
    "We have stayed at this hotel many times, but this last stay had some negatives for the first time. Elevator to the Self Service parking lot was incredibly slow leaving lines of people waiting to go up or down. Housekeeping in the room was not as good as it has been in the past. Room was never vacuumed (we were there for 4 nights), they forgot to leave coffee, didn't clean the glasses. Bed was still comfortable and and the view is always the best. Its location to Navy Pier and shopping is perfect. Staff is always friendly and helpful. So I will go back again.", 
    "Rooms aren't clean you have to beg staff to change towels and such. I enjoy the shearton in NY & SAN JUAN MUCH better ! ", 
    "Super time swimming. My room was perfect and staff was awesome. My view left me speechless", 
    "Our experience was awesome! We walked to Michigan Avenue and we had Chicago's famous deep dish pizza. Next we went swimming inside of the Sheraton. My kids had a great time!!", 
    "We had a very pleasant stay at Sheraton hotel. Location is perfect, very friendly staff.", 
    "Getaway over the NYE holiday. Dog friendly- that was great- no issues there. Overall a good visit.", 
    "Rooms to small and vallet made damage on my new car.", 
    "Hotel is just off the Mag Mile, on the riverfront. The room was large, with an excellent view. It also has the fastest elevators of any hotel I've ever been in! Frankly, everything about the hotel was good, with one exception. I had trouble communicating with one bartender - just a language issue - but another bartender stepped in to assist, and it all turned out fine.", 
    "The room was a little dusty. We were in the entry level room and the room size overall was pretty small. Beds are so comfortable! Location is great, only 15-20 min walk from Navy Pier and 10 min walk from Michigan Ave. We had great views of the Trump Tower.", 
    "We took the family to Chicago and stayed at the Sheraton for the New Year's holiday is a great experience very competent staff. The beds are very comfortable in the room is a little small and the bathrooms could've been updated but other than that is fine", 
    "Everything was perfect the only problem was our room was a little cold because of problems with the heat. But other than that fabulous hotel", 
    "Good one .. comfortable simple and helpful staff ", 
    "It was a nice experience, and the included parking was great. Is in a good location, within walking distance of many of the sites.", 
    "We enjoyed our view, location and room. The desk staff were outstanding!", 
    "Rooms are clean , bathroom are little rusty, air condition or the heat machine is in the room which makes loud noise which is hard to sleep ", 
    "awesome", 
    "Hotel is in excellent location and close to everything, and you get a great view of the Chicago River and Lake Michigan. Magnificent Mile is just that anytime of the year for anyone that has never been there. Free parking included in package was a big plus since downtown parking is big a rip off.", 
    "Overpriced for what you get. The hotel parking charge at $49 per night illustrates the very expensive fees.", 
    "Christmas shopping getaway in the city with family. Location convenient to Michigan Ave. Hotel has great view of the river from lobby areas & our room. Traditional room w/double beds very small. Spent most of our time in the lobby areas because the room was so small. Woke up w/banging construction noise at 7:30am.", 
    "Very valuable", 
    "It don't make u feel like u some where else", 
    "Took the whole family for a getaway in the city and loved it. The hotel was within walking distance to popular sightseeing venues. Hotel was clean. Staff was friendly and helpful. The indoor pool was a favorite with the kids!", 
    "Very dissappointed about cleanliness of room, had to move rooms due to dirty conditions", 
    "Great stay. Nice staff. Parking is a bit expensive compared to other options in the area.", 
    "Nice hotel, in a great location. Check-in went quickly, Eri was very accommodating and helpful. Loved our room - very spacious and a great view!", 
    "We had a wonderful stay overlooking the river and city. It was close enough to walk or take a taxi. They had taxi's waiting in the front. Check in was easy. The room was beautiful and very comfortable, quiet and clean. I would highly recommend a stay here. Our family enjoyed our stay. Lobby/bar area was decorated so festive for the holidays!", 
    "Beautiful spacious room with nice views to the city. Great location. Parking though is very pricy, use local lots. Pool was good but no hot tub. Nice gym. ", 
    "We had a great stay. Staff was very friendly, rooms were clean with plenty of towels. We loved the free shuttle to Macy's.The lounge was great. Only negative we had was the price of parking. I thought it was in my package but upon further review it was not. I will stay again but not use parking. I will use Metra or be dropped off. I definely will warn friends about the price of parking.", 
    "Easy walking distance to parks & shopping. Will stay again for sure!!", 
    "For the price, location and hotel, I will give this 5 stars. City and river view. The only complain I had was the bath tub not draining properly and the toilet bowl not levelled. I'm sure such things can be solved easily. ", 
    "Excellant location and value. We walked to Navy Pier and Mag Mile", 
    "Wasn't happy to have to pay for internet in our room. Sheesh, even cheap hotels have free internet service. Everything else was very nice.", 
    "Great experience for all the Familty, excellent location near the Bean, Art Institute and Theaters", 
    "Front desk staff were very friendly! Great location and price for a downtown Chicago getaway.", 
    "What a view! Bed was very comfortable.", 
    "As topic. Sheraton is Sheraton. Great location, great facilities, great staff, great everything", 
    "The room was nice and clean, and I needed extra towels and they were brought right up (little things make your day)", 
    "This Sheraton always has great service and a friendly staff. I've stayed at this hotel a number of times over the years, and it continues to be a wonderful place to stay. The rooms always do feel a bit outdated and are starting to show their age in minor ways (a broken bathroom tile, a loose drawer knob, etc.) But overall, the hotel continues to be well-worth the price, considering the location (a short walk from Michigan Ave and high-end shopping), and several great restaurants both in the hotel and within walking distance.", 
    "Overall nice stay. Staff was good and very easy check in and check out process. Location is good, and a quick walk to Michigan Ave. stores and dining,", 
    "Nice location. Well kept. Room was very clean and comfortable and spacious. Will definitely check into again.", 
    "Enjoyable the front desk staff was great!", 
    "Friendly and helpful staff Comfortable and clean rooms Great location with great view of Navy Pier", 
    "I stayed at the river-view room, the view was very nice. And location was not bad.", 
    "Beautiful lobby-very friendly and helpful staff-comfortable room-great view of city!", 
    "I would like to Thank Adam at the front desk whom checked us in upon arrival. I wasn't feeling well and he got us into a room right away so I could rest. Luckily felt better to attend our events that night.", 
    "Great service. .", 
    "Stayed from Thanksgiving 11/27 until Sunday 11/30. Staff very professional, attentive and engaging. Bar staff NOT SO ATTENTIVE on all occasions (a smile would go a long way). The only reason service was given a 4 was the bar service. We had a lovely view of the city and river. This is our second Thanksgiving stay here and we will come again. Bed very comfortable. Location is great for everything.", 
    "The room was great and the staff was awesome. Kids love the pool. Pet friendly too.", 
    "That was a great experience. comfortable hotel makes me feel stay at home", 
    "Excellent. But the closet' s door are old and without color and few items in the bathroom.", 
    "I think the air condition is broken, one of the fans comes out the warm wind but another one comes out cold wind. Also, the highest temperature of the air condition is 75F. The room is so cold if I did not stay in bed. Also, the elevator for the parking lot is so bad. If feels like it will stop working at any time. The room is clean and the neighborhood is good. It only takes about 5 minutes to walk to the Michigan Avenue. I think I may choose other hotels.", 
    "Third stay at this hotel in Chicago. All of them over the holidays (Thanksgiving and Christmas) Great accommodations,clean, employees cannot do enough for you. A great location on the river and half block off of Michigan Avenue. A must stay in Chicago!", 
    "I had a great stay over the Thanksgiving week. It was a pleasant one, I didn't even notice the different school kids there till I was going out of the hotel.", 
    "The room was very cozy and the view was just amazing!", 
    "Great location.", 
    "Front desk was kind and accomodating. Rooms were very clean, but need a little work.", 
    "Love it. Had a really nice time. Will be back.", 
    "The room was very pleasant. The bed was very comfortable, the bathroom very nice. The hotel's common areas were inviting and pleasant, with a nice view of the river and downtown.", 
    "A nice big hotel in a central location. I checked in late at night and the staff at the desk was very polite and kind. The only downside would be the temperature of the room, which was a bit chilly. I wish I could raise the temperature above the maximum, which was around 78. ", 
    "We stayed over for Thanksgiving! Great hotel location and condition! Plenty of restaurants to choose from in the hotel or walking distance from hotel! Close to shopping and movie theatre. ", 
    "Great metro atmosphere, located walking distance from the miracle mile. Clean room, great staff, and wonderful river view. Left an item behind after checking out, but the security staff retrieved it and had it waiting for me to pick up the next day. No complaints, will definitely stay again.", 
    "Great location in downtown Chicago. We requested adjoining rooms and loved the convenience. ", 
    "We had a beautiful room with a beautiful view! The staff was very friendly and the room was just what we wanted.", 
    "The location is perfect and stuff there are friendly", 
    "A great place to stay in the heart of downtown Chicago. Beautiful facilities but a bit pricey.", 
    "AppaRently the floor I was assigned to has not been remodeled yet, but is due for a remodel in the next year. Unfortunately I got stuck with it. Carpet was old. Furniture old. Mold in the bathroom. ", 
    "Great location! This was my second time here. Basic hotel but comfortable bed and nice employees.", 
    "had a great time in Chicago, nice dinner at the restaurant in the hotel, ", 
    "Worn room, no covers on bed, good location.", 
    "Hours and hours wasted to get internet. Would never stay there again.", 
    "great location! wonderful beds and linens!", 
    "About a block off of the Magnificent Mile. Next to Chicago River. Quick check in. Had breakfast room service. Hot omelet and warm toast delivered on time, but pricey breakfast.", 
    "the view from the room was good but their was nothing special about the room The room was NOT worth the money it costs to stay their.", 
    "Staff very helpful with restaurant and sight seeing information. We were very pleased with the staff.", 
    "When I arrived at my room, cushions were out of place, drawers were open, there were crumbs on the floors, grease marks on the tables, and glasses that were used and not cleaned up. ", 
    "Comfortable, clean, great location downtown, lighting in the rooms could be better", 
    "I was quite disappointed about the stay. I arrived at the hotel around midnight. The first room I got had trash in both the bathroom and the bedroom. The bed wasn't made right. The sheet was dirty. I had to go downstairs and change to another room. By the time I settled it's already almost 1 am. The location was good. I was just not expecting a dirty room when I'm booking a 4-star hotel.", 
    "It was a short stay but perfect for my needs", 
    "Great hotel. Comfortable room, good location. Only complaint was valet parking. Aside from the price, getting to claim your car on the lower level requires riding down several escalators from the lobby level. Then by happenstance, we went through an unmarked door to find our vehicle. ", 
    "Staff incredibly polite and helpful. Rooms are very clean and great views of Chicago in any side of the hotel. Location perfect for visiting Michigan Avenue and all the touristy spots. Highly highly recommended!", 
    "Fantastic accommodations and extremely friendly staff.", 
    "Room looked nice but was run down. I had to fight to get the closet door open. The bathroom had cracked tile and rust and was dirty.", 
    "Great stay.", 
    "The rooms are out dated and need a facelift. The washroom is so dated I don't believe it has been touched since the hotel opened in 1992. The lighting in the room was awful. The safe requires a key not electronic. The closet has a light on a string to turn on and off....not what I call a 4 star hotel. Rooms are noisy due to solid steel doors closing. Not a 4 star hotel at all. Very disappointed for the price I paid was not a 4 star room.", 
    "Only negative was that they would not allow me to earn my SPG points since I booked through hotels.com and the reception/check in staff on arrival was rude.", 
    "Pet friendly even with a great dane.", 
    "very clean,comfortable hotel,plan on going back!!Location is perfect!!!", 
    "My son and I especially loved the city views from our room. A must see for anyone in from out of town!!", 
    "The hotel itself is stunning, very luxurious. The rooms, however, are nothing special. I stayed in a double bed room. The bedding was fantastic and high quality, comfortable pillows. The bathroom was very dated and the shower did not drain properly. There also was no fan in the bathroom and it was rather warm getting ready after a shower in the morning. For the price of the room I would expect a lot more in the amenities and higher quality bath products. ", 
    "Enjoyed my stay. The view was spectacular! The front desk was very helpful. The bed was comfy.", 
    "Nice location. The room was nice and the service was great. The beds are usually better so we were surprised it was so uncomfortable. But overall there was nothing to complain about. The staff is what really makes this place great. They are always so nice. Also, I love that they are dog friendly. We stayed here once and they brought our dogs beds. Our fur babies loved it.", 
    "I was totally amazed that there was no free internet access in our hotel room, only in the Lobby. For the price of the room it really should include free internet service. Very disappointed. Also the rooms were very load, I could hear the neighbor above and next to us talking and running water for shower.This was very annoying as guests were coming and going at all hours of the night.", 
    "Nice property, in a great location. Poor housekeeping staff, and follow up by supervision caused repeated and persistent problems with our room cleaniliness, and maintenance. Would not recommend", 
    "Frequent traveler but typically stay at other family of hotel chains. Decided to have a fling with Sheraton and in short, it's going to stay a one night stand. Received a lower configured room than (pre) paid for without an apology or adjustment to rate. Parking (self, not even valet) was the most expensive I've experienced in Chicago. Room was not exactly clean, and bathroom had mold in and around the tub. ", 
    "It was short but sweet", 
    "The room was very clean and comfortable. We had a great view of the Chicago River and really enjoyed our stay!", 
    "I loved the large hotel and plenty of room.", 
    "Great hotel,service was wonderfull,room view and location were perfect,the only feedback that I have is the room service food quality,not so good", 
    "I have stayed at the Sheraton because of the quality of service and the central location of the hotel close to attractions and fine dining.", 
    "Just stayed two nights over the past weekend, but I received an upgrade to a room with a nicer view than I'd originally booked upon checking in. My experiences with the staff were uniformly excellent, and my room was very clean and well-appointed. Would stay again.", 
    "Only stayed one night, but it was effortless and comfortable.", 
    "The location of the hotel is wonderful, right next to the river so you have a wonderful view. We stayed here for a long weekend and loved we could walk everywhere including shopping, food and entertainment.", 
    "It was good.", 
    "This was my first trip to Chicago and I picked the hotel based on the proximity to the river. The staff was very accommodating with a high floor facing the river. The surrounding area is beautiful, the staff was great, the hotel is fantastic. I have plans to return to Chicago and will stay here again.", 
    "Hotel is close to shopping, the lake and museums.it was a lovely hotel.", 
    "Early arrival 8:30 staff on duty went out of their way to find a early room for me. Thanks to all.", 
    "There are not many hotels within the walking distance from the Northwestern University. This hotel is one of them, so it can charge a high price without updating its interior. Many room doors are damaged and not repaired. Parking is not free ($14 per day) but the garage is not well-maintained. The payment is falling apart. The lighting is very bad. 7 out of 8 lamps on the top story are out! On the other hand, the lighting in the adjacent city's garage is even worse. I cannot believe when I saw a lady went into a dark city garage to pick up her car at night. Breakfast is included. The choices of food are reasonably good and healthy. In-room Wi-Fi is included and is pretty fast. The room is clean and quite comfortable. The hotel is close to transit and train tracks so the train noises come up periodically. The windows noise insulation is not good enough. ", 
    "The experience was great . Family weekend getaway. Absolutely no problems..", 
    "Take the train in and water taxi close to hotel (Michigan Ave). River front, night life, architechural river tour, or walk to Navy pier. Hotel is super clean with a friendly staff. I have stayed here several times with entire family and there there is not a room with a bad view. Might want to pay a little extra for the premium and get a lake and river view.", 
    "This hotel sits right along the river and has amazing views of Lake Michigan and the city. It's very close to the shopping on Michigan Ave as well as many restaurants. I would definitely not hesitate to stay here again in Chicago.", 
    "If you stay in Chicago for downtown business or private, this hotel location is simply fantastic. Make sure to go for (or ask for) a riverside view room. The very(!) friendly and helpful staff at reception, gave me such \"upgrade\" to a riverside view room, and it made the stay at the hotel extra good with spectacularly view during night time. My highest recommendations to this hotel, staff and location (*****)", 
    "We went to Chicago on a short family vacation. The Sheraton staff was very friendly and the check-in was super quick. The hotel is fantastic and neat and clean. The room was tidy and had everything we needed. A couple of things that could have made it a dream stay - they charged 18 dollars for one day of internet usage and the breakfast at the restaurant costed us like 80 dollars. When a family has young kids it is not always easy to take them to other options outside the hotel. Valet parking of course was expensive but that was expected in a big city like Chicago. Overall though, we enjoyed the stay.", 
    "Good location, $700 per night does not cover breakfast, internet or even bottle of water... ", 
    "Great location - short walk to Navy Pier, Michigan Ave, Chicago River, Milennium Park, many restaurants and shopping. Highly recommend this hotel for family or business travel!", 
    "I stayed here overnight for an event downtown. Room was nice, clean, staff were efficient and polite. Nice view of river. I was rudely woken up by some loud rowdy guests who were slamming doors and banging on my door and trying to open my room. The shouting and slamming doors continued till 2 am. I could not get even a few hours of sleep especially after flying for 18 hours. It's not the hotel s fault. But wish they had more locks on doors and personnel on floors to curb rowdy guests.", 
    "I can't say enough about how great the staff at the Sheraton Towers were when I treated my two 13-year-old granddaughters to their first \"girls only\" trip to Chicago. They squealed with joy as we pulled into the car port and were greeted by a wonderful, cheerful and knowledgeable valet. They squealed again as we rode the marble lined elevator to our room, and squealed yet again at the wonderful amenities - a spotless locker room with sauna and a great pool for swimming fun! The room was comfortable and also spotless. The only negative was the size of the bathroom, but there may be no bathroom large enough for two teenage girls and their grandmother! The hotel is close to Navy Pier (we could see the ferris wheel at night from our window) and Magnificent Mile shopping, both of which we thoroughly enjoyed. We would definitely stay here again on our next trip to Chicago.", 
    "nice clean hotel near Navy Pier. Beautiful view from room window of lake and river.", 
    "The hotel was very nice. When we booked the hotel I paid extra for a river view but once we checked in we were told there were no river views available and were assigned a room on the 14 floor with a view of the roof and the Navy Pier. I did request a higher floor so that we did not have to look at the roof and were taken care of right away. The view of the Navy Pier was nice but really wanted a river view. I think a confrence in town prevented us from getting what we reserved.", 
    "The hotel was clean and location was good. I have stayed in fancier hotels with better accommodations for half the price. The rooms were small. You couldn't even use the fridge because they have the mini bar stocked with their items. I would not stay here again for the price. Parking was overpriced just as the rooms were.", 
    "The Sheraton on the Chicago River was exactly what we were looking for. It was a very nice hotel. We wanted walking distance to Navy Pier and Millenium Park. It was very easy to get to both. The parking was very convenient as well. We actually had a nice view of the city and small view of the Chicago River and Lake Michigan from our room.", 
    "Good experience overall. Rooms are small for the price and could be a little cleaner. Location was great quality of service was good but had one person speak in a not so pleasant tone. I would stay there again. I am hard to please so that that into consideration when reading this.", 
    "We had some issues with the first rooms cleanliness. But we brought it to their attention & they were very accommodating upgraded us to a different room which was very very satisfied. Restaurants were very expensive. But we walked two blocks over to a restaurant called \"West Egg\" food there was exceptional in very well priced. No hot tub so that was disappointing. The two gentl eman bartenders in \"Shulers\" was awesome. I ate dinner alone & I ate at the bar cause they made me feel welcome. Overall we loved the hotel and would definitely stay there again.", 
    "Ho trovato le lenzuola sporche e le persone alla reception non sono affatto gentili. Inoltre gli ascensori funzionano male e la connessione a internet (a pagamento) pessima", 
    "Staff were most welcoming and friendly. All staff greeted us in passing and were always helpful when answering questions. I would stay there again.", 
    "I frequent this hotel every time I stay in Chicago. Usually, it's top of the line. This trip was a bit off. I walked into my room to see a loud floor fan on high setting, drying a damp floor. The room was very muggy. I was in kind of a quandary, do I leave the loud fan on & keep drying the floor or turn it off & make the room even muggier? That was really my only complaint about this stay.", 
    "Great hotel. Location was great. Beds were very comfortable. Rooms were clean and staff were very helpful and friendly. Would definitely stay there again.", 
    "Comfortable, clean, friendly staff (I was upgraded to a nicer room for no extra charge), close to a theater, a drug store, liquor store & several restaurants within walking distance. I have stayed here several times & it never fails to make my trips so much more cost efficient & pleasant.", 
    "We took a weekend trip to Chicago and have always heard great things about the Sheraton. Upon checking in the the valet was quick and friendly. Checking in was probably the best and welcoming check in I've encountered. I believe the woman's name at check in was Toni (I don't recall) but she allowed me to check in 30 min before 3, gave me free wifi, and allowed me 1pm late check out. The room itself was probably the biggest downside to my stay at the Sheriton. The hotel itself is beautiful especially the lobby but the rooms are outdated and not the cleanest. My experience with the concierge desk was fantastic both times I visited. The people behind the desk were knowledgable and provided discounts to attractions/restaurants. Upon checking out I went to the check in desk ensure that 1pm late check out was still fine. To my surprise the gentlemen behind the desk starting telling me that they really shouldn't be allowing late check outs because they needed to turnover the room for the next guests (very unprofessional in my opinion). The gentlemen insisted we check out before 1pm but since we were allowed late check out during our check in it would be okay.", 
    "We love this hotel - one of our top favorites.", 
    "Loved the river side downtown location.The lobby , bar and common areas are new and attractive. Rooms are in need of a refresh. Furniture and bathroom showing signs of aging and decor a little dated.", 
    "Very friendly. Please let us know when you have special rates for a getaway weekend. Thanks.", 
    "Great sized room, comfortable kind sized bed, room service very good, close to shops and attractions. Very quiet.", 
    "Room was nice and clean. Comforter on top of bed was kinda old. Not kid friendly menus, but lots of places do deliver to hotel. Near navy pier and close to mag. Mile. Will stay again when coming back to chicago!", 
    "Nice room. Had a view of both the river and lake. $59 a day parking seemed a little steep. Would stay there again", 
    "Close to navy pier. Thee hotel lobby is very nice and the beds are great. shula's restaurant is very good. I would stay there again.", 
    "Liked the location. We had to wait over 30 min to get our car that had been valet parked. They had retrieved the wrong one", 
    "The location & view were fantastic! The showers were outdated and very loud when used by neighbor. Lobby beautiful but rooms lacked upgrades. TV was small, towels 1st day were rough/cheap, 2nd day soft/good. Not interested in returning, not worth $", 
    "I like a frig to put things in. Not all the expensive liquor and treats on the table that cost 11-15 per item. There were 2 missing spots of liquor bottles and some cherry tomatoes in there place. I informed staff I do not want to be chgd for the missing bottles of booze. Otherwise, the view was so awesome and beautiful. Hard to find hotel on gps. too many interferences. It is right by trump. Very nice bell service. But they charge for everything.", 
    "When I checked in, the room key did not work. I was let in the room by a bellman with the plan that someone would come up to the room with a new key. That did not happen. I made several trips down to get new keys with no success. Ultimately moved to a new room after many new sets of keys and resetting if the lock once and then again as we moved. Received free breakfast but that did not make up for the hours that were spent messing around with getting new keys, probably 3 hours at least.", 
    "The beds and pillows were ridiculously comfortable! Service was nice and parking was easy as well. It was a little noisy being next to the lake and staying on the weekend, there was some rowdy adults that had to be talked to due to their language and noise level. I will stay there again!!!", 
    "What can I say......great room, great view, great location.", 
    "This was a great Hotel, clean, staff very helpful. Great location!!", 
    "Beautiful view of the river from our room. Very clean! Staff very friendly and helpful. The perfect location for our sightseeing tour of downtown Chicago!", 
    "Great hotel, great staff, easy walk to Michigan Av or Navy Pier. 21 screen movie theatre across the street. Lots of places to eat at from McDonald's to high end within blocks of the hotel.", 
    "Loved the comfort of the room, the beds are comfortable as well. Hotel is a hotel with great service and stunning views! We have spent 4 nights in this hotel, 3 nights in a row and at the end of the holiday another night in a different room on a different floor. All 4 nights were broken nights due to loud, partying, sometimes obviously drunk people. Not once, but many times per night. Which did not give a restful sleep to us of course.", 
    "Found what I thought was a great hotel for a great price in a great location. Turned out to be a great dissapointment!! We were excited about our stay when we drove up to the hotel. The outside was very eye appealing. When we walked in to the lobby, everything looked very high class!! The guy however at the reception desk acted like we were interrupting his plans when we checked in...ok, I get it. I'll let it pass...it was 12am when we checked in, and people are allowed to have bad days. We admired the lobby as we walked to the elevator. When we reached our floor, it was like we stepped off a time machine to 1987!! The hallway was dark and out dated. The doors looked to be painted by my grandma and about 6 costs too thick. The room wasn't any better. The only up to date thing about the room was the tv. The view was decent, but for the price this was not worth it. When you get a \"deal\" on a expensive hotel, you expect to feel like you're stealing the room for the weekend. Not so in this case. In fact I felt like the hotel was stealing from me!! This was horrible and caused me to cut my vacation short. Was not worth staying 2 nights. I've stayed in a lot of hotels in this area, and this has to be hands down the worst stay I've had. Don't let the picture fool you!"

    "Very nice hotel, 2nd time staying here. Front desk is really nice.", 
    "Hotel is in a great location. Convenient to Million Dollar Mile, good restaurants, and all of Chicago's transportation. What makes this hotel exceptional is the staff. Everyone was exceedingly friendly and focused on our experience. They offered suggestions for things to do, asked how they could accommodate any requests. As an example, the weather was rainy and we did not have an umbrella. As we were leaving the employee in the lobby stopped us and offered to us a hotel umbrella, we did not even need to ask. Every requests was met with a friendly 'yes'. ", 
    "Excellent hotel for a vacation or work in Chicago downtown. Hotel is very centrally located to restaurants and convention center.", 
    "Absolutely fantastic staff! Perfect location. Would definitely stay again.", 
    " We stayed at the James Hotel for a weekend in April. We had a wonderful time, the staff is awesome! They are very helpful and very friendly. Any questions or concerns we had were addressed immediately and resolved. The rooms are nice and clean. The bed was very comfortable. I loved the location of this hotel! The only negative I have about the hotel is the noise. You can hear people in the hallway very easily which is a problem at 2 AM. ", 
    "This trendy hotel has it all: excellent location, perfect size, casual elegance, great bar & restaurant (food's pricey but delicious); friendly, helpful, professional staff; spotless rooms with good amenities, very comfy beds, hip decor, fast elevators. We had a great experience & would highly recommend this little jewel of a hotel.", 
    "Hotel staff were super friendly, welcoming, and helpful. The hotel is located in the middle of downtown, everything is nearby and within a 15 mins walking distance. ", 
    "This is the fourth time staying at the James and we won't consider anywhere else. It is centrally located and convenient to everything.", 
    "Perfect location, helpful and friendly staff who all are ready to help and make suggestions of what to do and where to go in Chicago.", 
    "The room was very nice and clean. Loved the restaurant and very close to Magnificent Mile and sights. ", 
    "Modern facilities. Convenient location. Recommendable. ", 
    "Very comfortable relaxing hotel,spent all day pounding the streets around the various attracting, shops and bars, then back to the hotel for a cocktail before refreshing and starting the evening entertainment! All the staff were very friendly and more than helpful with any of my needs. I totally recommend anyone staying here from the young partygoers (within short walking distances of great bars and clubs) to the older more refined within a short stroll to find a lovely restaurant or cocktail bar ( both of these you'll find within the hotel). ", 
    "Happy from beginning to end. All staff was very friendly. Room was immaculate. A lot of attention to details. Wonderful gym. Pleased with late check out time of 2:00. Very conveniently located to restaraunts and shopping. Would stay here again. ", 
    "Great hotel. Unfortunately my stay was marred by a late night wake up from drunken neighbors. The hotel took care of it, however it took about an hour for things to quiet down. I've stayed here several times and really enjoyed my stay, I hope it is an isolated incident.", 
    "This is the only hotel I stay in when I travel to Chicago. Great staff, very friendly and accommodating. The bed is very comfy and bathroom products are amazing! DB Primehouse is my favorite steak house; however the hotel bar and Jimmy next door are dead. The location is central and close to all...you won't be disappointed!", 
    "We were greeted at the door of the James immediately upon our arrival by cab from the airport. The staff here were literally the first Chicagoans we met on our first time in the city and it set the tone for a fantastic Chicago experience! ", 
    "I paid for the \"upgrade\" (nominal) that put us on the 14th floor with a view. It was very clean, very quiet, and the staff was at all times pleasant, helpful and professional. I have stayed in several other hotels in Chicago and this is a wonderfully convenient location just off Michigan Ave. The beds are made up with white sheeting over the comforter..none of those mysterious (ick) patterned spreads/comforters here. It was very crisp and clean. There are newspapers and coffee in the lobby and a bar and restaurant on site but plenty of options right out of the door as well. I also appreciated the original fine art and there is a business area (if needed) with computers and desks. Absolutely no complaints! ", 
    "great location, the staff were very friendly. easily accessible to the subway, and walkable to many main attractions.", 
    "I planned a weekend in Chicago for me and my wife, and no trip would be complete without staying at the James. From the moment we drove upper and had the car valet parked, to the moment we left, every staff member was awesome! They really understand customer service at this hotel, which is something some companies just seem to have forgotten these days. Great room with plenty of space. We have decided to always stay here from now on while in Chicago. Stay here...you too will love it and feel welcomed!", 
    "I stayed here for 2 nights. The room was clean and organized. The Smart TV in the room would have been great if it didn't lag so much. On one of the nights we ordered fries and a beer through room service. We specifically asked for hot sauce, no ketchup. We were told the wait would be about 40 minutes. About 45 minutes later, we got a cold, stale order of fries with no hot sauce and a bottle of ketchup. The beer came in a glass with plastic wrap covering the lid. The price for the 2 items was $22. Not staying here again.", 
    "Great hotel. Nicest staff you could ask for at a hotel. Definite recommend. ", 
    "Stayed at The James Hotel with my valentine over the weekend.... My experience was amazing.... Staff was very polite and attentive. The hotel was beautiful. Our room was so creative and romantically put together. I am looking forward to staying there on my next trip", 
    "We love the James a Hotel. Everybody is so nice and the rooms are so nice.", 
    "The hotel room had a usable desk and excellent lighting, perfect for a business traveler who plans to work from the hotel. The view of a demolished building wasn't ideal, but given the general comfort of the room, I didn't mind much. Also, the gym was pretty great for a hotel.", 
    "Front desk guy was pleasant. Room was small and quite plain. ", 
    "Absolut top Lage, Service und Komfort! Komme sicher wieder!", 
    "Very friendly service and superb location. Would book this hotel again.", 
    "An amazing stay, especially as we were impacted by the weather and had to stay an extra night. We were delighted with everything. Everyone so thoughtful and gracious. Highly recommend.", 
    "Check in starts at 2, and we arrived a little after 4pm to find out that our room wasn't ready yet. We were told it would be about 20 - 30 min and were given a drink coupon to enjoy 2 cocktails (from a list 5 drinks long) in the bar during that time. An hour later we still didn't have a room. The hotel staff said they would upgrade us in light of this which prompted my husband to ask if the bed size would still be the same (we had booked a king bed). We were assured that it would be but that was not the case once we got in the room. We had a queen size bed and the thermostat wasn't working properly (the room never went below 74 degrees). Considering it was nearly 6 pm by this point, we just decided to suck it up and take the room. The only reason I booked this hotel was because of all of the rave reviews but our experience was certainly not up to par. Plenty of other (and better!) hotels in Chicago.", 
    "Interesting Hotel! Comfortable bed and pillows, nice TV and within walking distance to nice restaurants. A bonus at the front desk, was the coffee in the morning and the hot cider in the evening! Car parking was pricey, but have nothing in area to compare it to", 
    "Great stay at the James. Great smaller, boutique hotel in a great location in the heart of River North. Service was great. The bathroom could be a bit bigger, but other than, everything else was great!", 
    "This hotel is very conveniently located. It is nicely decorated. The rooms are nicely arranged. The appearances are 4-star. The service and functionality were extremely disappointing. Due to allergies, we requested in advance that the bedding be changed out. It was not upon arrival. We requested this again. No one arrived to service the room for 4 hours. We requested the service a 3rd time. Our toilet clogged after that. Maintenance took 30 min to arrive. \"Fixed it\" but did not clean up the water from the floor. And, it actually was not fixed, so we spent the night with an unusable toilet. When we alerted the desk to this at check-out, the response was \"Do you want us to leave the $26 bar bill on your card?\" There are many places to stay that are as nice and more attentive to basic services.", 
    "Really enjoyed our time. We were there for a quiet night away from home, and found it so easy to unplug. Thanks so much!", 
    "We stayed at The James for business - the experience was great. The staff was friendly and accommodating. The decor was hip and modern. Loved it - plan to stay there the next time I'm in Chicago. ", 
    "Stayed at the James for a girls night out. It was wonderful, the staff was very welcoming and nice. The room was small, but clean and comfortable. There were a few places in the hallways you could tell needed some updating, but overall very nice!", 
    "Great hotel!", 
    "The staff was very professional and polite. We arrived ahead of the standard check-in time to find our room ready for us. The room was very quiet, nicely appointed, and was decorated with newly designed furnishings The mini bar was one of the best \"in room\" bars that I've seen. There were two robes in the room plus spa quality shower amenities. The bed was very comfortable and there were multiple pillow options to chose from. All of this coupled with the unbeatable location made this a destination to return to.", 
    "Our stay was very pleasant . The staff was very accommodating. We stayed in the king deluxe and I didn't like that there was only one drawer in the mini bar for both of us to put our clothes. I also did not like the small bathroom, with no vanity space for two. There was not any where to sit to dry my hair. Also the closet was too small.", 
    "Perfect place for a weekend shopping getaway!", 
    "The room was not as nice as I thought it would be. It was tiny, not very clean old looking.", 
    "All hotel staff were friendly and helpful. Room was perfect for a shopping weekend with my daughter. Proximity to Michigan Avenue is excellent.", 
    "Hotel was nice. Staff was great. Location amazing. Was more than happy w stay", 
    "Couldn't have been more pleased with the James. First things first, the hotel's location is hard to beat. Just a block from Michigan Avenue and walking distance to so many good shops and restaurants. all of the hotel staff from the doorman, the courtesy car driver, the concierge, the front desk personnel, maintenance and housekeeping were amazing friendly, professional and accommodating. I think they went above and beyond what i have experienced in most other hotel properties and they should be commended. The room was the \"loft\" room and it was outstanding. Very spacious and while it's not super clear from the website the room has a bedroom and living area with a couch and a media room with another queen sized lounging area that is essentially another very comfortable bed that they will make up as a bed for you upon request. This was great for traveling with children although keep in mind that there are no doors to either \"room\" so there is no true privacy. also there is no lock on the bathroom door; which i hate. i don't get this trend. but that was my only nitpick with the room itself. I will definitely be staying at The James on my next visit to Chicago! Can't recommend it enough ", 
    ".....My family and, I stayed at the James to celebrate the New Year. We loved the location , and, the reasonable distance to the attractions. Our housekeeper, Helen kept our room clean and comfy. Thank you. ", 
    "The hotel was beautiful. The staff was great. The area was perfect. Would definitely stay here again!", 
    "Quick weekend getaway, really impressed. Big hotel service and amenities with boutique hotel feel. Location is literally unbeatable. Get an interior suite and was comfortable with the tradeoff between a city view and the spacious room. Nice in-room bar selection, and appreciated the coffee in the lobby each morning. Carafe of water was also a nice touch, but having TJ's across the street for bottled spring water and other misc. small items is perfect. Wonderful stay and a very good value.", 
    "This hotel was in the perfect location for easy access to museums, dining, and shopping. Everything we wanted to see or do was within walking distance, and the area was clean and safe. Our room was amazingly quiet and very well designed.", 
    "The hotel was beautiful, and in a perfect location. My husband and I came for a Christmas getaway. The doorman was always so pleasant, friendly and helpful. The front desk however, was not. I felt like a bother when I stopped up to ask a couple questions. Other than that, we would stay here again.", 
    "We wanted a quiet place to go to sans the children. Comfortable. Great rate. QUIET. We'll be back.", 
    "The James Chicago was a lovely boutique hotel with friendly and helpful staff, clean and comfortable rooms, and was perfectly located for our trip needs. We enjoyed the small and intimate environment and the stylish and modern decor. ", 
    "Staff was exceptional Valet is a mess. Takes 30 to get car and cost is exorbitant $60 a night ", 
    "Front desk should be better be familiar with the local restaurants/attractions. I inquired about the House of Blues for dinner and entertainment and the concierge thought she was being helpful by reserving us a table in the foundation room. I was surprised that we needed to make reservations (which should have been the first clue) but the front desk insisted this was the best thing to do. Turns out we were booked in the members only section, where they publicize their support of debauchery on the website....... We were not given the choice to confirm our preference - local or private. The second incident - i inquired about a restaurant called McArthurs (that should have been the first clue that i had no clue where i was going) we were simply interested based on an article in one of the magazines in the hotel room where the author cited it for having outstanding \"soul food\". We came to find out the neighborhood was not a good one, in fact trying to get a cab to pick us up proved to be a challenge (since there were no cabbies willing to take the chance of entering the neighborhood). I would have expected some form of insight from the front desk. Other than that, the hotel itself was very nice and the neighborhood is good. I would return and would recommend with a word of caution with respect to the front desk staff.", 
    "We have stayed at The James many times and have never had a problem. Great location and friendly staff. ", 
    "The locations is great and the hotel is nice and clean", 
    "Right in the heart of downtown Chicago, the James is well situated. Dining and shopping are right out the door. ", 
    "What a great hotel! My husband stays here when he is in town for work but it was also great for our family when we tagged along on one of his trips. It is trendy but practical. We had a loft room which was plenty of room for us and our toddler. I requested a quiet room so that our toddler who goes to bed at 730pm would not be woken up and they accomadated us. The David Burke restaurant in the hotel is amazing. We had dinner one night and even though its prices are regular for steakhouses they were more then welcoming to our toddler. They have an impressive kids menu that our son loved! All of the staff was so helpful-especially belldesk and guys at the front door. You are really close to all the great restaurants and shops. This hotel is a great value for how wonderful it is!", 
    "tenth visit and still great.", 
    "Convenient location and very nice, helpful staff. What a great start...and then the disappointment of a room with furniture that is frankly goofy and does not fit the layout (an obstacle course to get in/around), a squealing shower and a slow draining tub. Is it that hard to get things right inside the room?", 
    "great staff. Friendly service all around.", 
    "Enjoyed the hotel. Great vibe and close to fabulous restaurants and shopping. I would stay here again.", 
    "We visit Chicago twice a year and try to stay in a new hotel each time. The James has an excellent location, just off Michigan Avenue and close to many shops and restaurants. Check-in was pleasant and efficient and valet parking was convenient. There's not much to the lobby bar, so we opted to have drinks elsewhere. We were on the 7th floor, street view. A stay on a higher floor would have afforded us a better city view. The bed was comfortable, and the shower was hot and strong. We liked the organic minty shampoo and body wash in the shower. Bathroom was otherwise small. The room was modern and well appointed. Our only complaint was the hairdryer. I didn't bring my own and the one provided got hot but barely blew air and it took a long time to dry my hair. The staff was professional and courteous. For the price, though, I'd just as soon stay at The Acme or The Wit..", 
    "Excellent, everything went as planned, room was great.", 
    "We were a little disappointed that this hotel is rated at almost 5 stars. We stayed on the top floor, 17 and it was so incredibly noisy at night with sirens, etc. it woke us out of a dead sleep. The beds were small, and the room amenities were not user friendly. The rooms were large and the staff was very nice.", 
    "The bedding is exceptional. Bathroom OK - very small, not at all luxurious. The rooms have lots of outlets and the right amount of furniture. The ambience is chic and young. I had a very comfortable stay", 
    "Perfect location near shipping and restsurants. Great, simple room. Great staff. Loved the the restaurant suggestions. Would stay again.", 
    "Fantastic location. Doorman's lunch recommendation was great. Staff very friendly. ", 
    "Traveled to Chicago for a business conference and stayed at the James for three nights. The hotel was quiet and well located. Very comfortable room, friendly staff, nice gym and just around the corner from Eataly. What could be better. My room did not have a view and that was the only thing that was missing. I like the small lobby so you don't feel on display when you go and come from you hotel room", 
    "Me and my wife stayed here while going to a Concert at Chicago Theater. The staff and room was amazing. They actually have comfortable beds, unlike many other hotels. We had a great time!", 
    "Great room. Clean, very comfortable around the corner from shopping and restaurants. Cant wait to return", 
    "Nice Room but felt a little worn down, still comfortable and clean - staff were all very nice and accommodating - shower was terrible - tub felt cheap and shower head did not move ", 
    "I had a very pleasant stay at the James. The room was very comfortable. Amenities were perfect and the staff was very helpful. I look forward to my next stay at the James.", 
    "Great room friendly service nice restaurant too Great toiletries!", 
    "The location is awesome, but parking was a bit of a letdown. Paying $45 for self park, or $60 for valet is a bit ridiculous. Overall though, awesome place.", 
    "The location was great and the staff was really helpful. We got there early and they actually called my cell phone when the room was ready. The concierge had great suggestions on what to do and where to go. ", 
    "Great Location, Great Service, Comfortable bed. There was more street noise that I expected. I felt gauged at being charged $60 per night for parking. The room was decorated ultra modern.", 
    "Would not consider this hotel anything higher than a 4 star, everyone was very nice but the amenities were limited.", 
    "The James Hotel is in a great location with outstanding service. They are surrounded by notable restaurants: Eataly, David Burke Steakhouse and a Shake Shack opening very soon.", 
    "Simply amazing", 
    "The staff and door men at The James were super friendly and helpful. The hotel was so conveniently located that we walked everywhere. The rooms were clean and well stocked. We are already talking about staying there when we go back for Christmas ", 
    "Great stay. Especially useful was the late checkout.", 
    "Location is great, the people working are wonderful, since they open the door for you they make you feel welcomed! Hotel is really nice", 
    "We had a wonderful stay in this hotel. The staff were so helpful and attentive. The location is really good with some lovely restaurants nearby.", 
    "Six girlfriends shared three rooms and we had a lovely stay. The bar was great and Jamie, the Bellman was so wonderful! We literally walked everywhere we wanted to go and were thrilled that we were so close to everything. We all agreed that we would happily stay here again.", 
    "Since they greet you at the front, everybody is so friendly and nice. They try to make you feel very comfortable. I deffinetely recommend the hotel and the location too!", 
    "The people make the trip, and the people who work here are top notch, especially Jamie at the door and Stacie in the restaurant. Also, don't stay here if you don't plan on eating at the Primehouse--it's delicious!", 
    "This was a lovely boutique hotel. The property was clean, fresh and updated. It was close to everything we wanted to do and had a wonderful restaurant. I would certainly stay here again while visiting Chicago.", 
    "I spent 4 days/nights in Chicago for my birthday and stayed at the James Hotel. When I arrived, the front desk was extremely friendly, helpful and welcoming. The lobby was buzzing with action. Being situated with the #1 rated steakhouse in Chicago doesn't hurt either. The room was suite and relatively spacious. The doormen were all very friendly and courteous. The thing that I liked the most was the location. The hotel is situated very close to several first rate restaurants and the Magnificient Mile which is great for shoppers. ", 
    "Amazing hotel with wonderful staff and service. Would stay again. Only complaint would be the amount of alcohol in the room. Although I realize not a problem for many/ as non-drinkers, it seemed excessive. When asked to have alcohol removed, we were told of a $75 charge to do so. We opted not to have it removed- but an \"alcohol free\" option of rooms for non/drinker might be nice.", 
    "We had an excellent stay at the James. We arrived on a Friday morning at 9:30am thinking that we would drop off our bags and head out for the day since checkin isn't until 2pm. We were pleasantly surprised to see that our rooms were ready, and my travel companion who booked a separate room was upgraded to a studio free of charge. The James is perfectly located in the heart of the Mag Mile area and is a short walk to all the great shops and restaurants in the area. I would definitely stay at the James again.", 
    "The hotel is in a great location, the staff was very helpful and polite. ", 
    "This hotel is great. It's a boutique hotel, but very well done. Extremely comfortable. The staff were very welcoming and helpful with directions, baggage and recommendations. First time in Chicago and it was a great one. Would stay here again and again.", 
    "Beautiful hotel. Loved the art in the rooms and on display. Loved the robes and toiletries provided. Only downside was our toilet creaked every time I sat on it (I am not big). ", 
    "Very professional staff, was able to use their bikes at no cost for a lovely ride along the lake. Beds are very comfortable.", 
    "The staff was excellent and service was wonderful. I loved the hotel! ", 
    "I just stayed for 1 night on business. Large room with a sittiing area and a wet bar. There is a bar and a good steak house on site. I plan to stay at The James again next time I'm in Chicago for work or pleasure", 
    "The hotel is situated in one of the best downtown neighbourhoods, if not the best. Just off the Magnificent Mile, the hotel also features a renowned steak house, rated #1 in Chicago. The hotel was a pleasant experience to return to after a day of enjoying the wonderful city of Chicago.", 
    "I had a very positive experience at The James Hotel. The staff member that greeted me was very helpful and hospitable. We sought the advice of the Concierge an hour later and had the same experience. She provided us with some simple must sees as our trip was short and it was my first time visiting Chicago. The room was spacious, clean, well planned out. We will definitely stay there again. ", 
    "Lovely hotel with nice amenities (had to laugh at \"gluten-free\" shampoo and conditioner though). Perfect location for our weekend activities. Bar service was worthless first night but improved after that. Would definitely stay here again.", 
    "Went for Garth brooks concert and had a blade, so many more places we visited especially the magnificent mile, navy pier , ate Chicago style pizza what a treat wished we would of planned to stay longer never knew Chicago was sooooo beautiful, recommend to everyone to visit Chicago, attractions and city bests New York by a long shot!!!! Will return for sure, try a me at the purple pig you will not regret it!!! Take a stroll with a horse abs buggy, what a charm!!! Plan to stay for a week you will not regret it!!!! ", 
    "And a great location.", 
    "Staff was nice. Rooms were small. We stayed during the week day. You could hear all the noises from out side. We have stayed at other hotels that were nearby. And did not have that problem at all. It reminded us of a over prices motel6. Will never come back again", 
    "Terrific hotel, great location. Rooms are unique, especially the King Loft, as the loft ara is a very cool hang-out bed with a projector and audio/visual, but unfortunately NO TV hook-up in the loft. So watching a game or such requires the uncomfortable sofa, but still a great stay.", 
    "Great mini bar and mini frig in the room with drinks and snacks. Very comfortable lighting, nice size room, staff are excellent. Location is convenient to the art museum, restaurants.", 
    "Great staff, clean, modern hotel with the best linens and amazing mattress. They don't skimp on towels- they are bath sheets. Starbucks via coffee and tea in room. Gym was great. The only downside was no pool. Spa ans massage onsite. Not a single complaint about our stay.", 
    "We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at The James. The room was beautiful (we were upgraded as it was my birthday) and all staff were friendly and helpful. Bar and restaurant were also very good. The hotel is centrally placed just off the Magnificent Mile. ", 
    "This is by far the best hotel I have stayed at in Chicago. The room was very clean. The staff was very friendly. Plus the location was great. ", 
    "Close to everything. Loved the art in the hotel. The staff that handled the room service was a bit rude but the rest of the experience was good. Clean rooms in a pretty cool hotel.", 
    "Excellent base for doing business in the windy city. Room very comfortable and easy to work out of. Location is ideal for restaurants and safe for walking around in the evening.", 
    "This is our fourth stay at the James in as many years. We drive from Texas to visit family and friends. The location is great and we can easily walk to major attractions and restaurants. The staff is so helpful and friendly. We reported two minor problems in our room and they were literally fixed within 10 minutes of our request. We used the work out facility and enjoyed the treadmill. We wouldn't think of staying anywhere else and look forward to our summer trip to Chicago.", 
    "Beautiful hotel and very close to shopping and subway. ", 
    "The James Hotel was perfectly located in Chicago with shops restaurants and all amenities minutes from the door of the hotel. The room was spacious and bed was so comfortable . The staff were extremely helpful and friendly.", 
    "Wonderful stay at a wonderful hotel located near everything you could possibly want to do. ", 
    "They do not have a microwave and the fridge is full with their booze.", 
    "The staff was extremely kind and helpful overall. But we ordered room service and the food was horrible and overpriced. We ordered a cheeseburger/fries and a grilled cheese/fries and a Caesar salad. The burger was very greasy and the meat quality was poor. We only had one bite of the salad (it was the worst caesar salad we have ever had). The grilled cheese was cold and the cheese itself was chunky and oily. With tip the bill was $67. The beds were extremely small and very uncomfortable. The room did have a refrigerator but it was filled with mini bar items so we were unable to put our items in it. For the price of the room, there should have been a microwave. The bathroom sink's water never got hot. The shower was exceptionally nice though and had great pressure. It was disappointing that the hotel only had one town car available for use, especially since the policy was no reservations ahead of time and you couldn't request a pick up from a specific destination. We were there for a concert at Soldier Field and basically because of the hotel policy it made it impossible to even consider using the hotel car; because plans needed to be made ahead of time. So when the concert was over, my daughter and I walked for over an hour before we were able to get a taxi. The hotel should have been more accommodating to guests in this instance. The hotel itself was beautiful and clean and in a great location. The staff was friendly also. But overall I would not recommend this hotel and would not stay here again. For the price, the extra amenities you would expect, were just not available. If you wanted to swim you had to go across the street to another hotel. Not very practical with a five month old and a six year old. Also, for the room price and what you actually received, an additional $60 a day for parking seemed excessive. The next time we stay in downtown Chicago we will be trying a new hotel.We were disappointed with our stay.", 
    "Great hotel! You are in the center of everything, and it is a great place to stay for both business and travel. We will definitely stay there again next time I am in Chicago!", 
    "As New Yorkers we love the NYC James but we were disappointed here...The location is good for all the City Center sites but the hotel itself was disappointing. We were hoping for a slice of luxury hotel feel for a weekend away but the minimal decor starts to feel more budget hotel than modern and cool once it gets scruffy and worn at the edges. The room was small and bland rather than minimal. Two broken items in our room and a random wet patch on the carpet appeared midway through our stay! Two tiny lifts were overwhelmed by holiday weekend traffic and unfortunately lower down rooms seem to suffer with traffic noise (not surprising but good to know in advance). With no pool or lobby bar the place missed having atmosphere in our opinion. On a positive the staff were mostly helpful and the cocktails at the Jimmy are amazing!", 
    "The hotel is very nice, clean rooms, friendly staff and perfect location.", 
    "The James is located perfectly for shopping and dining anywhere downtown. The staff went out of their way to be of any assistance we needed. We had a \"loft\" suite which couldn't have been more comfortable. We will definitely stay here next time in the Windy City.", 
    "The James is well located, clean, has wonderful service (great concierge), many amenities (gym, spa, free wi-fi, access to computers in lobby) and a wonderful restaurant and bar. I give them an A+ in the factors they control! My criticism is that the surrounding neighborhood is VERY loud. From bedtime to early morning I heard non-stop sirens, tons of loud car stereos, banging garbage trucks and beeping delivery trucks. If you are a heavy sleeper you may do fine but I did not get a full night's sleep during my four night stay. We were on the 9th floor...maybe it was a lot better higher up...ask for the highest floor you can get but beware the elevators are limited in size and frequency. This is common in the many well-renovated hotels in this part of town. The great news about the neighborhood is you are close to the CTA, the train and tons of restaurant options running the gamut of price and quality. I love that the hotel was near Trader Joe's, Starbucks and a wonderful Jewel Osco store. I would stay again but would request a higher floor and maybe take some ear plugs.", 
    "The James was outstanding. 1st class hotel in a great area. Not the largest rooms, but updated nicely. And the service here is fantastic. Not one complaint on our side.", 
    "We secured the James Hotel through an Expedia package a few months out at a good price. When we arrived several hours before check-in the room was ready. The concierge was very helpful with tickets to tours and shows as well as restaurant recommendations and transport directions. One morning we were able to take advantage of the courtesy car for a ride to meet a tour guide. When rain was threatening, complimentary umbrellas were available. Even the coffee served in the lobby each morning was quite good. On the day we checked out the hotel kept our bags all day until 7 pm while we enjoyed the full day in town before heading to O Hare. Don't hesitate to book the James for a stay in the River North area of Chicago!", 
    "Air conditioner too loud. The room is not cleaned up even though we don't put the don't disturb sign.", 
    "Overall we had a great time and we would recommend this hotel to anyone who travels to Chicago. The staff was helpful and accommodating. We ended our girls getaway with a visit to the spa it was the perfect ending to a very enjoyable stay a the James hotel Chicago :) ", 
    "wonderful staff; fabulous restaurant; terrific location; excellent concierge staff. the rooms need some updating", 
    "We had a wonderful stay at The James Chicago. The staff had excellent suggestions for restaurants and booked every night for us. The beds were so comfortable and the room was very clean!! A great central location!", 
    "Com certeza ficaria novamente.", 
    "The front desk staff and concierge were extremely helpful. Breakfasts were very good and service was efficient.", 
    "Our stay at The James was perfect. The hotel is beautiful and in a great location. The room was very clean and a nice size. The staff was wonderful. Everyone was extremely friendly and very helpful. Their recommendations for dinner were right on. Will definitely come back!", 
    "Although the room was not what I expected it to be (more updated)according to the pictures, I was not totally dissatisfied because it was very neat and clean. The bed was very comfortable. Probably the most comfortable that I have experienced with any hotel. The staff was very polite and helpful. I also enjoyed having concierge available for questions about the city. I was allowed to check in early because a room was available. There was also a room to keep luggage if you arrived early and the room wasn't ready, or in my case waiting for my flight to leave. It is also conveniently located in the heart of the city within walking distance of a lot of attractions.These were some of the things that made my stay here worthwhile and receive my recommendation for booking.", 
    "Comfy, clean and very helpful staff. Hotel is situated within walking distance of everything and the taxi service is very prompt at the hotel. The beds are comfy and the only thing I didn't like is the instant coffee in the room with a kettle. The lobby has complimentary morning coffee, which is very good. Although I dont prefer to dress and leave my room to get my morning coffee. Other than that, I highly recommend the James. I would definitely stay again.", 
    "Very clean, excellent service, great amenities & location. I would definitely stay again.", 
    "We stayed here 3 weeks ago and the hotel is close to the mag mile shops and plenty of restaurants around. My room had a lounge area with a secondary TV, was spacious for a couple. Clean and fairly new rooms. Enjoyed our stay here and would recommend to anyone whether young or old.", 
    "very nice stay, hotel staff was professional and helpful, good newspaper selection...and thankfully umbrellas!", 
    "1 - I paid for a river-view suite- did not get it - 2 - I paid for a suite to comfortably accommodate two adults & two children. One dresser (aka TV stand) had only two drawers & a broken shelf that was available for clothes. Only a few hangers were available in the closet too. IN THE KING SIZE BED AREA: 3 - I had to request bedding for this bed. I requested pillows, sheets & comforter. They gave me two flat sheets (instead of one & one fitted sheet) & I had to make/fix the bed myself. Never received fitted sheet entire stay. 4 - I had to request a lamp due to no light(s). They gave me a bent/broken lamp that needed the wall to stay up/still. 5 - The overhead projector continuously broke down & had continuous scratching sounds throughout DVD playing. IN THE MAIN SITTING ARA: 6 - The TV sound had to be set at level 100 to hear it over the air-conditioner. Then, the TV sound had to be set at level 50 (or higher) to be heard - normally. IN THE QUEEN SIZE BED AREA: 7 - The TV sound had to be set at level 100 to hear it over the air-conditioner. Then, the TV sound had to be set at level 50 (or higher) to be heard - normally.", 
    "24-7 operation with trailers drop off and pick up. None stop noise. 3 nights there and not one good night of sleep. On top of that their valet made is wait nearly 30 min for the car. Yikes.", 
    "Everything about the James was great. Staff were super friendly and helpful, location was perfect and hotel was clean and we'll kept. Would definitely stay here again in the future and recommend. ", 
    "A couple of my girlfriends and I spent a weekend at The James, as recommended by another friend. The entire staff was incredibly, providing prompt service when needed and excellent recommendations on the surrounding area. The James is close enough to all the downtown Chicago attractions while being away from some of the Michigan Avenue traffic. Our room was very well appointed and comfortable, with lots of small unexpected amenities like free WiFi and free water that made our stay even nicer. I would definitely stay at The James my next time in Chicago.", 
    "Great location to use as a base for a downtown Chicago visit.", 
    "Excelente hotel. Bonito, limpo, bem localizado e com atendentes muito educados. Recebe compras da internet sem tarifa.", 
    "From the moment we stepped out of the cab, we were greated with a big smile and a helping hand. The location is fantastic if you want to walk to all of the downtown attractions from the Hancock Tower down to Millenium park. The L is close at hand for further trips. The Ribhouse is world class and the servers were superior. This is a great deal for an excellent value!!!", 
    "Stayed a weekend with my daughter and couldn't have been happier with the hotel. Great location downtown. Very clean, quiet. Would stay here again.", 
    "I have stayed at The James before, and it seems to only get better as the years go by. The location is outstanding, the staff is professional and friendly and I have never had one complaint with the quality or cleanliness of the rooms. This is my go-to hotel in Chicago. Looking forward to staying there again.", 
    "James at the front desk was awesome!!! Such a help. This hotel is a great stay. Definitely staying here next time I'm in Chicago!", 
    "I would highly recommend The James Hotel. It's in a perfect location. The staff, hotel, room, and restaurant were all fantastic!", 
    "From the moment we pulled up in front of the hotel, the service was superb. My wife and I were both impressed by the professionalism of each and every member of the staff that we interacted with during our five-day stay. More than the cleanliness of the room and the fantastic location, it was the personal attention of the staff that stands out. The James is our new personal favorite for Chicago, and we hope to stay there every time we visit the city.", 
    "I thought the hotel was very accomodating in terms of friendliness of staff, cleanliness of the lobby and the hotel rooms and the location. I was very happy with the service and would stay at this hotel again when visiting Chicago. I also enjoyed the lounge area near the bar as well as the restaurant attached to the hotel.", 
    "I booked this hotel solely based on the reviews. All the reviews stated it was very clean, friendly staff and conveniently located. The reviews were all correct. I would definitely stay here again.", 
    "Well located with smallish bathrooms, average closet space and only one single drawer in which to put clothing. Very friendly and helpful staff.", 
    "HOTEL WAS CLEAN & COMFORTABLE. LOCATION WAS VERY GOOD CONSIDERING IT WAS MY BUSINESS TRIP.", 
    "I stayed here while attending a conference at a hotel down the street. I am so glad I did because it was far more comfortable than the conference hotel! Elegant rooms with plenty of space to work and relax. The only downside was having to call room service to get ice delivered since they don't have public ice machines. Other than that, our stay was fantastic--a few blocks from Michigan Ave. and near many restaurants. A few blocks from the Red Line and a short 15-minute walk from the Blue Line, which was handy since we came in/out of O'Hare. Will definitely try to get a room there next time I'm in Chicago!", 
    "Everything was great. We loves the late check out time of 2 pm, the location and the good sized rooms. The concierge could have been more helpful", 
    "Our room was very spacious for a city centre hotel, clean, comfortable and very quiet. We appreciated the 2.00pm checkout as we were able to take a short rest before setting off on a long journey. The staff couldn't have been more helpful.", 
    "Great hotel. Very clean. The restaurant was awesome. Best lamb chops I ever had. Perfect location.", 
    "I stayed at 3 hotels in downtown area during my trip and the James ranked up there with the others - let's face it, Chicago is an awesome city and it is hard to go wrong but I really loved the room layout in the James, the complimentary local water, the complimentary morning coffee and the excellent service -- for the great price I got on hotels.com, I would call it one of the best values ever - highly recommend", 
    "The hotel staff was extremely helpful, patient and accomodating. We were a difficult, high maintenance group of 3 adults and 3 teenagers. They handled every special request (and there were lots) with a smile. The James is a great location within a block from Michigan Ave. and a Trader Joe's across the street. I would love to return again.", 
    "Thoroughly enjoyed recent stay at The James. Each and every staff member, from those on the front desk to those greeting & hailing cabs to those working in the spa, made us feel welcome and at home. Special kudos to Bill (concierge) for taking time to recommend restaurants and entertainment. I will definitely be back! Visitors to Chicago should try out this conveniently located, eco-friendly boutique hotel!", 
    "The room was clean and comfortable, and the staff was super helpful and responsive. I had a package arrived the hotel ahead of me and the concierge, Laurelin helped receiving and storing it in advance. There were few emails back-and-forth with immediate feedback. And the package was delivered to me upon my arrival which did me a great favour. The staff delivered more than I expected which made my stay much more delightful.", 
    "I didn't care for the shampoo, conditioner, or soap. I think for the price of the hotel you should have at least received free shampoo bottles.", 
    "Room was great people were fantastic.", 
    "You couldn't ask for better service or a better place to stay in Chicago! Hands down the best pick in the windy city.", 
    "The James was a treat! We had a nice room the bed was comfy. Staff was very helpful. The James was right in the middle if everything. Close to the L and plenty of nice restuarants and shopping. ", 
    "Most 4.5 star hotels are pretty nice, but this one is different. I thought this hotel should be 3.5 stars. ", 
    "It was fabulous from check in to check out.", 
    "Loved the room and staff. Room could use another mirror for when the bathroom is occupied. ", 
    "Room was beat up and Air Conditioner not working correctly. The repair service came to our room but couldnt do anything and they had no more rooms.", 
    "The moment we arrived at The James Hotel, we were greeted by very pleasant staff. Our room wasn't ready, so we were offered drinks (complimentary & delicious) in the lounge while we waited. The room was amazing! A lounge area in our room that had a projector TV with surround sound, a sitting area with another flat screen, and a very comfortable bed....of course with yet another flat screen! The rooms were very quiet. It's located in a very desirable area of downtown. The dinner was phenomenal! A must!", 
    "A friend and I decided to book at The James hotel last minute at the 4th of July because everywhere else seemed to be booked. The moment we asked for help at the valet was a red flag and should have known better to stay with this hotel. The valet was very rude and unwelcoming as we were just trying to find other alternatives to park besides valet because we have had a bad experience in the past with valet services. The pretty much set the mood for the entire evening as we only stayed for one night. The double queen room we was very loud and uncomfortable as were trying to get a quiet nights rest. It was pretty obnoxious with all the police sirens and ambulances and overall noise from the streets as we could hear EVERYTHING. I would not recommend this hotel at all. The $250 plus $50 parking was not worth it period. Would have rather stayed somewhere else and paid for a much cheaper room not in the city had we known that it was going to be an experience like this.", 
    "Great experience and almost everything in walking distance.", 
    "Loved our stay. All of the staff were very friendly and helpful, and the room was lovely.", 
    "The concierge was very helpful, and the bikes came in very handy! The guys at the door were amazing, and so was the steak at Primehouse. Loved every minute of our stay!", 
    "Service was excellent...valet was very helpful. I left my jacket in the car and they ran to grab it and brought it right up to my room. I thought that was nice lol.", 
    "This very well located hotel provided an excellent basis for our short stay in Chicago. Our room was clean and comfortable. It was easy to walk to most of the places we went to. Breakfast was tasty. Definitely a place we could stay at again in the future.", 
    "The James hotel is ideally situated, just off the Magnificent Mile, and extremely close to all main attractions; whether you wish to walk or taxi. The staff are very polite and concierge extremely helpful. The hotel itself has a very bespoke feel and atmosphere adding to an all-round perfect stay. I would recommend this hotel to anyone wishing to stay somewhere central with a special personal touch.", 
    "We loved how central the hotel was and the staff was very helpful. ", 
    "Although the hotel is in a fabulous location, we were not impressed with the front desk customer service and the slow housekeeping.", 
    "My boyfriend and I visited The James over the 4th of July holiday and we couldn't have asked for a better hotel! The rooms were great size, well appointed, luxurious, the beds were so confotable, the lighting was abundant and great! We were on the 11th floor and had a decent view of some of the surrounding residential buildings. The concierge was so helpful and got us a table at David Burke's in about 15 minutes (one of the best steakhouses in the city is right in the hotel). The staff was so friendly, the hotel as a whole was very quiet, aside from street no use. Even though it was one of the busiest weekends for the hotel, it never seemed crowded, too loud, or anything negative. The location is PERFECTION as it's one block off Michigan so it's a less crowded street, but its walking distance to everything, including Navy Pier. I truly cannot express how satisfied we were with The James. You absolutely can't go wrong here!", 
    "My wife and I visited Chicago for a few days in July we absolutely love the hotel right locations restaurants and shopping courteous and kind staff clean hotel room overall a great experience", 
    "Staff where very helpful , rooms clean . Staff accommodated our request to have our family stay on the same floor which was most helpful as there was 6 adults and 2 children . Our only complaint was that our room was not ready until 3:30 . We arrived around 1 and would not have expected to get our room until 2 pm which is what we were told when we arrived. Our plans were based on those times and so where very disappointed while we sat and waited to get in our room", 
    "Very nice staff , centric place , clean, good restaurants around", 
    "AndGood location very good restaurant! But old looking with dark and small corridors and rooms. Very nice and helpful staff. Best part close to Lake Michigan and Michigan Avenue!", 
    "This hotel is just one stree from the Magnificent Mile (prime location!) and overlooks Marshall's (love a deal!). You can walk to many places very easily or grab a bus within walking distance to go see all the must-see's in Chicago! The staff was incredibly helpful and even called the Shedd Aquarium for us to see if they would hold our luggage (FYI: they actually have lockers that fit carry on rolling suitcases for only $1!). I will definitely stay here again. ", 
    "Comfortable sophisticated rooms, great location, amazing staff!", 
    "Wifes shopped, friend and I took complementary bikes to beach, then to lincoln roof top bar to meet wifes for drink. Then rode to goose island brewery for quick sample. Staff was very helpful and friendly. Bed was very comfortable. Would definitely return", 
    "attentive staff from bar, check in, door person, concierge, and cleaning staff", 
    "I had a very pleasant stay at this Hotel in June. The Hotel has a friendly, cozy athmosphere and I was very welcome everytime I went in or out. Felt like I was taken care of, and never overseen. Very nice staff both at reception and by the front door. Very personal service. I enjoyed a lot their complintary morning coffee. The gym is very well equipped and clean. The location is perfect, right on the Magnificent Mile with it's shopping divine and only 1 km to the nearest beach and lake shore. I will definitely come back.", 
    "Staff was friendly, courteous. Clean, \"hip\" rooms. Loved the daily flavored water in the lobby!", 
    "Pleasant and quiet, close to the theatre. The experience was 100% positive.", 
    "Overall very good and comfortable hotel. Nice location with walking distance to most of the city attractions.We got excellent help from the staff with sight seeing bookings and so on.", 
    "After staying at a conference hotel down the street for three nights, I switched to The James Hotel in order to stay over the weekend and see more of Chicago than the inside of a conference room. The James Hotel was just the change that I needed. Not only was my room at The James much less expensive than my original hotel, the room was also much, much larger! My husband and I stayed in a Studio Suite which included a separate living area and a massive bathroom. The room had a very zen like quality which was a great retreat from the hustle and bustle of the city. Speaking of the city, The James Hotel is also in the most perfect location. Just a block off of Michigan Avenue - which makes it close to all of the attractions and shopping that Chicago has to offer. We also took in a Cubs game while in town, and the red line was only a two block walk from the hotel. I would definitely recommend this hotel and stay again upon my next trip to Chicago!", 
    "Our original room face towards the quiet inside atrium but we were promptly switched after asking for something with a city view. Very friendly and helpful staff", 
    "I will return", 
    "Great service all around, close to restaurants and shops.", 
    "Amazing location, super accommodating staff , luxurious amenities ... Highly recommend!", 
    "We weren't at the room very much as we were out sightseeing most of the time. This hotel is conveniently located a block from Michigan Ave (Magnificent Mile) and walking distance to many sites like the John Hancock building. It is also a few blocks from the red line train which made it simple to get around. They also offer a complimentary car service when available. Overall our stay was good. Cons- the hotel front desk person didn't know much about the area when we asked for a good burger place to watch a hockey game. He said he could look up reviews for us- well I can do that too! Thanks! I could also hear through the walls a bit but it was overall a quiet hotel (not a ton of partying nearby).", 
    "Not your standard type hotel, a bit contemporary but nice. Staff were friendly.", 
    "Room was incredibly large and very comfortable. Towels and robes some of the best I've seen anywhere. Tons of amenities. Great concierge service. Would stay again.", 
    "This hotel was in the perfect location, you could walk essentially anywhere downtown. From the amazingly comfortable bed, free water/coffee/wi-fi and gracious staff I would highly recommend this hotel. Being health conscious, I especially appreciated the toxin free bath products. I highly recommend and will be back!", 
    "Shopping, the lake, Naval Pier, Museums - all within walking distance from this great hotel. The hotel is modern, bedding was a dream for a restful night after all the walking. The staff was fantastic, professional, friendly and so courteous! The room was very clean, emphasized by the white decor, and attractive interior design. Thank you Hotels.com for helping me find this great place in the middle of the best part of Chicago!", 
    "We had a really great stay. The area is perfect; just one block from the action and yet that one block means that it makes for a peaceful sleep in a funky hotel surrounded by great restaurants. The only improvement The James could make is in getting some more bikes so be sure to reserve one if you are looking to cycle.", 
    "Really great location. Actual artwork on the walls! Very pleasant, great staff.", 
    "Great location, good price, great bar, great minimalist style! I would definitely stay here again.", 
    "When you're tired of the giant hyilton chains and their sad, thoughtless design. When you hate to pay good money for a room and then 12 bucks more for wifi. When you hate having to move the furniture to get to the power outlets. When you like a good looking bar, with a good looking crowd. - The James.", 
    "One block off the middle of the Magnificent Mile.", 
    "A lovely comfy and spacious room with everything I needed. As a Brit, I was delighted to see a kettle! I had a guest room with a king size bed which was the best bed I've ever slept in. There was a bath, but it was very shallow (I guess they intended guests to mainly use the shower). That was the only thing that did not quite match the luxury and comfort of the rest of the hotel. The restaurant was expensive, but very very good, especially if you love steak. I didn't get around to using the spa or the gym as there's simply too much to do in four days in downtown Chicago.", 
    "Hotel staff were excellent. Made us feel very welcome.", 
    "Excellent location, one block away from mag mile and close to everything within downtown tourist spots. Great friendly staff. Would recommend to friends.", 
    "The hotel is in a perfect location as it is situated centrally to everything I wanted/needed to do. The staff was very friendly and professional. While the room wasn't set up exactly how I would have liked, it had everything I needed. It was clean and I also liked the emphasis on environment and natural products. The gym was fantastic and the restaurant/bar was better than average. Overall, I liked the stay and would stay here again.", 
    "Great hotel, optimal location, awesome room. Very professional staff", 
    "Checkin was flawless, my 2yo received the kids welcome pack. Free filtered water in the hotel room. We stayed in the loft, beautiful. Daughter watched the big screen and thoroughly enjoyed the whole experience. Bed was comfortable. Next time we will request a view of the street, as our view was looking inside the hotel walls. Great location for families, with so many restaurants and Trader Joe's across the road. Very close to Magnificent Mile, at a fraction of the cost of a hotel right on the Mile.", 
    "The James is a great hotel with helpful, professional staff. The location is wonderful...close to the Magnificent Mile and a wide variety of restaurants. Major attractions were within walking distance of the hotel. Bikes were also available in the lobby free of charge. We enjoyed our week at the hotel.", 
    "Hotel is well situated just off Michigan Ave. Convenient to the Red Line for Cubs or Sox games. The room was very clean. The furniture--chairs and sofa were extremely uncomfortable. There was a great deal of trouble with the electronic door lock to our room. Multiple sets of keys did not work. The engineer eventually replaced the door lock. Hotel staff was very courteous. We go to Chicago frequently, but will most likely not stay at the James again.", 
    "We enjoyed this hotel. Friendly staff, good location.",

    "Great location. Very comfortable. Staff extremely helpful. A great stay.", 
    "Loved it all around.", 
    "Hotel was convenient and very comfortable. Great beds and pillows. Only problem was they pick up trash at 11:00pm and it lasted about 1/2 hour. Very noisy and hard to sleep until it was over. Breakfast was great and the service was helpful.", 
    "The hotel does it up right. Great service, great food and a stones throw from the shops."

    "Very very nice staff especially Sammy at the front door. Rooms run down with tattered carpet and the most incredibly uncomfortable sofa bed that must have been a hold over from a medieval torture dungeon. Overworked hotel maid apologized in late afternoon as she had not been able to service our room. Loud street noise funnels up through the tall buildings right into your good nights sleep.", 
    "Loved the suite -- though the fold-out couch wasn't comfortable for those who ended up having to sleep there. our king suite really slept three not four. Good space for a family as the \"bedroom\" provides quiet and privacy. We were very disappointed that the pool was down for maintenance -- that was something we were looking forward to. Breakfast was better than expected. Definitely recommend for Chicago travelers on a budget. Highly recommend you don't plan to park a car here.", 
    "The hotel is older but that is the charm in visiting Chicago. Staff were great. The full breakfast was a treat to have each morning and a $$ saver as well. The only bad thing was the valet parking cost...$55 per day. Next time I would park my own car and walk to the hotel ", 
    "This is an older property, but it's a great hotel. It's a great River North location, the rooms are large with plenty of space, and the free daily breakfast is a great convenience--as is the free wi-fi. The gym is adequate with two treadmills, an elliptical machine and weights. I'd definitely stay here again.", 
    "Loved it! Breakfast was tasty. Pool was very nice. My view was awesome. We loved the stay. The hotel was near everything very convenient.", 
    "Got 2 rooms changed. The smoking room was not a good experience. We were told they would air it out, but don't think that happened. We were very disappointed that we couldn't get 3 rooms changed. When booking the rooms, it asked for special requests. As I was handicapped for the past 3 yrs. I never dreamed in this day and age that non-smoking would be a special request. My mistake. ", 
    "Everything about facility was wonderful! Only negative was the 2 front desk clerks we encountered were not very friendly, we felt like we were bothering them. The parking valets were great & accommodating!", 
    "decent stay with good value (free breakfast buffet and indoor pool); close to Magnificent Mile and great number of restuarants", 
    "We took our grandsons to Chicago for a spring break trip. The hotel was perfect for our needs. The suite provided a complete kitchen and the 2 rooms were separated by doors. A very good hot buffet breakfast was provided on china with silverward. You can even get a free dinner Monday-Thursday.", 
    "The pictures make this hotel look like a very nice hotel, but it is not that nice. It is actually too pricey for what it is. This is NOT a Hilton, it is just owned by Hilton. Self parking is $46 and $55 with valet parking. The heater in the room wasn't working so we had cold nights, even though we asked for maintenance and they told us twice that they will send an engineer, but he never came.", 
    "Heating vent was right over the bed and never turned off. Was sick (slept) the whole trip, bed was very comfortable. ",

    "Close to Michigan Ave with easy access to lots of shops. ", 
    "Great room and staff, beautiful city skyline view from our room, great breakfast but VERY busy, crowded on the weekend (Spring Break). Valet is standard fee for the area and the staff was very helpful, timely and professional ", 
    "Stayed at this hotel for a quick getaway. Excellent staff and valet service! Good location! Free breakfast was a plus! Nice little buffet with plenty to choose from! When I stay at a hotel I look more for location than fancy hotel rooms and services included. So for me it was a great hotel for the money! ", 
    "Great hotel. Concierge were extremely helpful and courteous! Buffet breakfast was delicious and beyond our expectations. Would definitely recommend this hotel to others. ", 
    "overall very satisfied. hotel is at a great location and staff was very friendly the entire time. ", 
    "Hotel facilities itself are nice and clean. Very convienent to restaurants, shopping & nightlife. Rooms were clean, bed was comfortable. Front desk staff were not thorough, when I was done with checking in the lady just turned her back on me. She didn't say anything about the transaction being done, I had to ask if we were finished. ", 
    "Great place for family with swimming, free breakfast, convenient location, and very helpful staff.", 
    "I stayed 5 nights. Reception staff is very rude. When I checked in they never greet me or say Hi to me. Just charged my credit card even without telling me. In the room wash basin is cracked. kitchen water faucet is broken. Tried to turn down the faucet and it broke & dropped in to my plate. I manage to put it back. Room service never clean counter tops.They never replaced my tea bags/creamer/sugar for coffee. I informed reception about it and it took more than hour and never showed up. I went to store bought it then went to reception and told. Instead of apologizing, receptionist start arguing with me saying they put some supplies in my room. No manager to talk per receptionist. Also inside room is too warm. After i informed an engineer showed up. he told me air condition is not working it is turned down. Only air conditioning is open the room windows per engineers recommendation. Bathroom shampoo/soap/body lotion replaced only once. Even I complained about all these no one contacted me even with a apology. Restaurant and door staff is good and they do what they can. I been traveling many times and stayed in different hotel. This is the worst experience so far. Fairmont hotel in Vancouver Canada is excellent. Anyone need to know what is real customer service go to Fairmont Vancouver. This Homewood management need to send their staff to Fairmont hotel to find out how to serve your guest. Homewood is a place you MUST avoid no matter what is the deal you get. DO NOT STAY.", 
    "a bit unsual as the lobby is on the 6th floor. no room service. Large and well equiped kitchen area.Full size refrigerator Lovely comfortable bed. Room was VERY quiet-and we stayed on St Paddy's day weekend. Valet parking was expensive but efficient and friendly. ", 
    "While staying at the Homewood Suites in Chicago, we experienced friendly staff from the valet to the reception area. I was pleased to know the \"EL\" subway system at State and Grand was within 1 block from the hotel, this was very helpful for us being new to the city. The room itself was comfortable and spacious, but the floor boards in the kitchen were separating and some of the outlets were crooked (MINOR ISSUES). My husband felt breakfast was catered to the adult population and we were traveling with 2 children, I felt it was sufficient for our stay. When we return to the city we will look here first. It was close to shopping and a short ride to any attraction using public transportation. We lucked out because, I didn't look for access to transportation close to the hotel and was pleasantly surprised by the system close to us. (use this as apart of your appeal to the people!!!!) All in all, I would stay here again and my 6 year old daughter had so much fun she wants to move to Chicago....", 
    "This hotel is in the middle of everything in Chicago Downtown. Our room was ready on time and the staff was very friendly. The hotel room was clean and open-spaced. It was very quiet and the pool was clean.", 
    "It was a wonderful experience, breakfast was great and staff was excellent. ", 
    "It is good that the room we stay has a kitchen. The suite is too small compared with the Hilton I stayed. Two ladies at the reception were reluctant to answer the questions. I didn't feel like being at home. The only thing that we felt good about was the breakfast and the reception. The waitress is so nice. The sink in the bathroom was cracked and broken. It looks cheap if it is not repaired properly. I didn't expect that we could not find any parking spot on the street in downtown. We had to pay $55 for parking each day for 7 days. It costs us $400.", 
    "Hotel did its job. Was able to rest and relax. No issues and got a great rate for my stay!", 
    "The guy who checked us in was rude and disrespectful throwing me my driver's license and credit card towards me and when we called guest services they would hang up on us. The eye on the stove didn't work our bedroom stayed cold and we ended up with a cold when we asked for a skillet they told us let me see what we can do. Been to Hilton before third was the worst.Won't be back", 
    "Room was fine. Breakfast was very disappointing", 
    "Everything was good except the gentalman at the desk when I checked in very rude", 
    "Our experience was fantastic! Our room was clean, quiet and comfortable--all with a terrific view of the city. The bellhop staff was very accommodating and extremely hospitable. The front desk check in and check out was not as friendly as other properties we've stayed at.", 
    "This would be a great place for families! Great buffet breakfast and a fun, rooftop pool, ideal for families. Easy walking distance to great Chicago pizza, coffee, and shopping. ", 
    "Great location, especially given the poor weather - easy to get to Michigan Ave. via mall entrance across street. Free breakfast was good, and it was nice to have a kitchen. Missed having a mirror for back of head and makeup; a safe would be a good addition.", 
    "Had a great time. Very friendly staff. It was a weekend getaway right here in the city where we live.", 
    "We had a great time in Chicago and this hotel made everything much easier. Anything we needed we were able to get. We were also close to most everything we wanted to do, and could easily get to anything else from the trains near by. The rooms were all large and clean, it was great to come back to each night. Our two year old had a great time and slept easily in the crib they made available. We loved being able to grab a quick breakfast in the morning. We can't wait to go back.", 
    "Quick weekend stay while apartment hunting. Room was clean, enjoyed the refrigerator, microwave, and living room area. It was nice to have a lot of room. ", 
    "Hotel staff was very nice and really friendly. Breakfast was a pleasant surprise. All items were kept fresh, they even use real plates and silverware. We never had any problems with the staff. Their is anything that you may need within a short walking distance. I do believe they should update their couch and chair in the suites. The furniture wasn't real comfortable after 10 minutes of sitting. Our 16th floor corner room had a wonderful view. ", 
    "We have been to Chicago several times and this was our first time staying at the Homewood Suites. The layout of the suite was great - quite spacious and the hotel itself was close to many attractions.", 
    "We love staying at the Homewood Suites. And the front desk personnel, one in particular, is excellent.", 
    "Awesome location, close to Eataly, Trader Joes, Quartinos, etc", 
    "loved it. you offered so many perks, too - just great. and your staff were all way above average.", 
    "Really enjoyed my stay at this hotel,excellent location, nice view of downtown, excellent customer service, Star at the from desk super sweet and answered all my questions regarding the area...everybody the doorman personal and all the from desk ladies always with a smile to greet you! The breakfast was really good as well.I'll recommend to my friends this hotel.Definitely I'll stay again at the Homewood suites!!!:-)", 
    "1 King Suite Room was very comfortable for 4 people to stay. Also, it was great to have both breakfast with fresh fruits and yogurt and dinner, which helped us save money for meals. The location was good to take the Red line and bus stops are so close to the hotel. ", 
    "Fantastic stay. Convenient location. Friendly staff.", 
    "Great location! (right next to Eataly!) Super clean and super friendly staff :) Plus the price was amazing!", 
    "Hotel was excellent! Surpassed our expectations! Loved it! Staff excellent treated us royally! Highly recommend it!", 
    "Hotel in a great location", 
    "We came for the Cubs convention and had a great time with the family. Plenty of places to take the kids, all within walking distance. Great time by all. One comment about the pool, the water was a bit chilly, and the bathrooms were not great, otherwise great hotel.", 
    "Great hotel, convenient to everything! We will definitely book again.", 
    "LOVED IT. Everyone was friendly, atmosphere was relaxed. The location is great. Close to Michigan Ave and around the block from Eatly. The daily breadfast was delicious with several hot options. The price was great also. The rooms are suites so room to visit others when not out on the town. Will definatly stay here again. No Complaints!!!", 
    "Great location! Check in and check out was easy & quick. Hotel amenities were pleasing. Loved my suite room which had a great view of downtown. Definitely will stay again. ", 
    "Great experience overall. Very helpful staff and awesome location close to shopping. Room condition just okay, showed some signs of wear and tear. Free breakfast a nice value-add.", 
    "Nice clean room with an outstanding view. Staff was extremely friendly and helpful. Breakfast was excellent every day. Location could not have been better! We would definitely stay here again and recommend this hotel to our friends!", 
    "This is our go to hotel when visiting Chicago. Spacious suites and excellent location for shopping, dining, sightseeing, etc. The complimentary breakfast buffet is a bonus, and provides plenty of selections. The staff is always welcoming and helpful too.", 
    "I had a wonderful visit with my sister. The front desk personnel were very friendly and helpful. The room was beautiful and extremely comfortable. The complimentary dinner and breakfast were not only convenient but tasty. I will definitely stay here again!", 
    "This hotel is awesome, clean, friendly and in prime location. Will be staying there more", 
    "Location is perfect and it was very clean. Fitness center offered a nice view.", 
    "Overall we had a great stay. They have a good location, nice rooms, they serve complimentary breakfast and dinner on a few days of the week. Staff was great and helpful. Will definitely stay there again.", 
    "The hotel exceeded our expectations.Suite was great base for our six day visit to Chicago.Staff happy and helpful.Rooms clean,very quiet and bed comfortable.Breakfast was good and kept us going all day.Monday to Thursday Managers reception was a bonus and on several nights we just ate in hotel.Location is great close to Grand station on the Redline and lots of shops,restaurants and bars within easy walking distance. We will be staying here again.", 
    "Great location. Red line is right outside the door", 
    "I have stayed in Chicago at least a dozen times over the years at various hotels and this was definetly one of the better experiences. The staff was friendly and the rooms were suprisingly quiet for downtown Chicago. Also the front desk is on the six floor, the first floor is valet and parking garage occupies the levels in between. I actually liked that the check in desk was not on ground level, made it much more pleasent to go there for questions or to visit the little shop that sells snacks, drinks and souvenirs. The continental breakfast area was across from the check in desk and was nice to go to in the morning.", 
    "Upon arriving at the hotel, the people were great, nice, and helpful. The room was spacious & very comfortable. I didn't get a chance to make breakfast but I know it would have been good from the smells. Definitely am planning to come back. ", 
    "The room was nice and cozy, the location was great, the breakfast was impressive, the furniture was a little dated however", 
    "Amazing service and room! Great view and location!", 
    "Right downtown, this hotel offers all the amenities: full kitchen, breakfast and lunch, and a nice staff. My only complaint was the lack of available room service. One day we stayed I'm, and j was surprised to find no food options available. Also, their Suite Shop was totally understocked and they didn't replenish anything but the beer the whole six days we stayed.", 
    "Our room was great. Spacious and comfortable.", 
    "This place was the best hotel we have ever stayed at and it saved us so much money having buffet style breakfast and dinner included!! Everyone was so nice and helpful with any question we asked since we aren't familiar with Chicago. They happily held our luggage for us to allow us to see Chicago a bit more longer. We will definitely return and recommend!!", 
    "Really enjoyed our stay here. Pleasant and helpful staff, nice hotel. Awesome free breakfast, and also they put on free dinners with beer and wine from Mon to Thursday night. Really nice food too and plenty of it, can take it back to your suite or get it delivered if you don't want to eat in the dining room.", 
    "great location", 
    "Located in the River North area two blocks off Mich. Ave. Eataly right next door, Nordstrom right across the street. Found parking a block away on Spot Hero for $26 per day. Only negative was the breakfast but with the rate we got we could afford to buy something. ", 
    "The hotel is positioned perfecty in walking distance of everything imaginable.", 
    "This is our families favorite hotel to stay at in Chicago. It is centrally located and within walking distance of everything. The breakfast and dinners are delicious. Staff is always so friendly and rooms are spacious and very clean. Would recommend this hotel to anyone. We will definitely be back very soon!", 
    "Checked in early at 9am (instead of 4). Close to michigan ave and a lot of great restaurants/bars. Lovely staff. Free breakfast daily and dinner on mon-thurs (with beer/wine included). Very comfy king size bed. Would definitely stay here again. ", 
    "The staff was extremely pleasant and efficient. the breakfast delicious and we loved the breakfast hostess Connie. And Lorraine at the check-in counter was a real treasure. The only dis-satisfaction was that the hotel and rooms were worn looking.", 
    "fun times with a friend. Second time we chose this hotel because the first experience was outstanding.", 
    "The hairdryer was defective and blew a fuse, there were no blankets, and I called twice to request 2 blankets, yet only one was sent up. Parking was overpriced.", 
    "Great hotel, conveniently located in downtown Chicago. Rates were reasonable inclusive of breakfast and dinner (Monday - Thursday). The only issue we had was the dinner was different than what the menu displayed. We'll recommend this place to anyone who wants to go for a family weekend there.", 
    "Thermostat was fake, temperature does not adjust. Breakfast was with fake bacon and fake eggs. Extremely expensive valet parking. Hotel starts at level 6 of the building. Nice view of Trump building.", 
    "This hotel is a joke , I waited a 1 1/2 for a room , the hair dry had fire shorting out of it , the cable was broken and my family and I got put out .....worst visit ever .", 
    "A gret stay and location.", 
    "Excellent location! Broken bathroom handle-locks you out from inside. Broken coffee maker as well as toaster", 
    "Really great having a kitchen and indoor pool. Location was very good. Lots of families. But very no frills. No newspaper in the morning. No main lobby to speak of. Not much knowledge regarding options on nearby tourist attractions. When I asked about a local museum's times, instead of checking, they said, \"I guess that sounds right\". Parking was a fortune, especially since no one told me that there would be extra time added over 24 hours. We checked in at around 2 and left at 5:15. Parking was close to $85. That's a little less than what we paid for the room. Staff was friendly and nice. For what we paid overall for one night, I expected more.", 
    "My daughter and I only stayed one night, but we very much enjoyed it. Loved the convenience of the Valet service, expensive, but to be expected for downtown Chicago. My only complaint was that there was no hot tub by the pool, the view, however, was spectacular.", 
    "Great stay during Christmas. Nice location, and great breakfast. Also it is unbelievable that the hotel offers complimentary dinner on Monday through Thursday.", 
    "Expect they charged more then they stated it was ok. The pool area was great and loved the view.", 
    "very clean. surprised with what came with the room for the price I paid for it", 
    "Wonderful Stay ! We took our girls and their families to have a Christmas experience down town. The Hotel was perfect with the King suites, especially with the toddlers. Wanted to take them to Eataly for dinner and it was right around the corner walking distance. Then we all walked to the Daily Plaza enjoying the sights and sounds of the city of Chicago. beds and bathrooms were clean and comfortable. Breakfast in the morning was very nice. Check in and out were smooth, Valet was very nice. We would love to come back next Christmas season for two nights.", 
    "This was my first time ti downtown Chicago so I was a bit worried I'd have problems. It all worked out well. We found our hotel easily, and pulled up in front. We grabbed our stuff and they took our car. We checked into our room with friendly helpful staff, and were very pleased with our room. It was very roomy along with a nice mini kitchen. The view was nice, and we were able to walk to all the attractions that we wanted to see. Then there was the breakfast. Outstanding! Very happy with the choices for breakfast. We had a great experience here, and will probably do it again. ", 
    "We were really happy with the location. Easy access from the airport and to shopping, attractions. Breakfasts were great but the one supper (supper only available during the week) we had we could have passed on. Though it was free, there are many better places to visit that are close by. Beds were ok, but overall we were really happy with the accommodations.", 
    "We loved this hotel. It was close to everything, especially transit and shopping, and the staff were unfailingly courteous and helpful. The furniture was a bit run down and the sofa bed was too small and quite uncomfortable, but aside from this our experience was a pleasant one. Very reasonable, too, for downtown Chicago.", 
    "This hotel is located just behind Nordstrom's north of the river. Gorgeous views of Wrigley Bldg, Trump and city from the pool on top floor. EASY walk to State Street, Water Tower, or any public transit. Tons of well-known eateries nearby. Cabs galore. Room was very clean, spacious and comfortable with a lot of attention to detail, e.g. quality coffee with little creamers, well-stocked kitchen, Neutrogena toiletries, huge flat screen TVs, comfortable bedding with plenty of pillows.. Breakfast was wonderful--hot fluffy eggs with cheese and chives, sausage, biscuits and gravy, cereals, Danish, yogurt with fresh fruit, French toast with fruit and whipped cream, and great coffee. Second morning things seemed a bit over-nuked or something, but still OK. Clientele was polite and well-groomed. Have stayed in many Chicago hotels. This was a GREAT STAY and we will be back!", 
    "From the valet service, the guys were polite and friendly Check in a breeze, Homewood inn suites is clean warm friendly service outstanding We went in to Chicago for a Christmas weekend with are daughters and their families . The room a perfect for my grandchildren, very accommodating We all had a great posituve experience Would come back again for two nights", 
    "You couldn't ask for a better downtown Chicago location. Walking distance to Macy's and State Street as well as Michigan Avenue. Full kitchen and separate bedroom as well. I live in Chicago and I was acting like a tourist all weekend!", 
    "Very nice Suite. Great location for the Mile", 
    "I do a lot of traveling to Chicago for work and have tried a lot of hotels, and I have to say this has been the best so far. Location right near a subway stop, great location, spacious rooms, clean and comfortable. One of the best perks is free breakfast every day and free dinner mon thru wed.", 
    "My sister and I stayed at the hotel in November of this year. We arrived at the hotel at 10:30 and we were able to leave our bags so we could start our shopping. Our room was really nice and the staff was kind and accommodating.", 
    "If you have a car, add $55+tips to the price per day for parking so not such a great deal when you figure that in. Will likely shop for a parking included hotel next time I visit Chicago or stay on the perimeter at a suburban location where parking is not a premium.", 
    "Wonderful, right in the heart of downtown Chicago. Everything about the hotel was great. They were helpful, and the breakfast and dinner was fabulous. The room was superior to other hotel rooms as you have the three distinct areas of bedroom, kitchen and living room.", 
    "We stayed for one night. The hotel location is very good. Everything is walking distance. The reception guy was not friendly at all. He even did not see us when we talk. He threw back my ID and credit card. Except this guy we overall enjoyed our stay.", 
    "Good service, nice room and great location. When we go back Chicago we will stay there again. ", 
    "The hotel itself probably has seen better days. The rooms and the building itself are a little run-down (furniture-wise/ interior-wise), e.g. the door between living room and bedroom wouldn't close properly, the wood on the bottom of the bathroom door was rotten (due to humidity) , all of the seating furniture was stained. The main problem for me was that the hotel is partially a smoking hotel and you can smell that basically everywhere. I made the mistake and wanted to use the laundry room on the 7th floor which is a smoking floor. Disgusting is all I can say. I didn't even get to the laundry room because the smell made me gag. On the other hand the staff was amazing. Always helpful und friendly. We needed an extra crib and a highchair. Both was brought to our room within a few minutes. Aside from the interior, the room was cleaned well (bathroom, floors, bed), in terms of cleanness everything made a good impression. The breakfast room is in the same shape as everything else but it was clean and breakfast was good, nothing special but good. Also the location of this hotel is extremely convenient and central, about 2 minutes from Michigan Ave and about 5 minutes from the German Consulate which was the main purpose for our visit this time. Overall it's an ok hotel if you know what to expect. ", 
    "Okay 1 night stay. Very convenient hotel - close to Red line. Had been looking forward to swimming - pool is empty. Staff were helpful. ", 
    "Room was very clean n tidy. Although first night was alot of hammering upstairs, people next door were loud, our bathroom hot water lever was leaking n maintanence never came back to fix it. Location was perfect close to everything n walking distnce.", 
    "Excellent hotel. Great location, great staff. Clean and comfortable suites. Nice pool with a wonderful view. Breakfast was a nice bonus as was the free grocery shopping service.", 
    "Somehow got booked into a smoking room. Asked to change at check in and was told only one room available. Toilet was broken and never got fixed.", 
    "Great location.", 
    "Had wonderful trip. Breakfast was awesome. Excellent location.", 
    "A little disappointed after expectations from pictures. Very small rooms, and even terrible if you have to pull the couch out. Usually stay at Embassy Suites, tried this because of location. Never should of done the change, embassy suites or even just a straight hotel room for now on. Never even tried the free breakfast after seeing it and elevators were few and crowded.", 
    "We had two adjacent rooms, both well-equipped with full kitchens, which was very convenient for leftovers. Rooms were very quiet, and staff were uniformly friendly and helpful. Complimentary breakfast and dinner buffets are an added bonus. Would definitely stay again.", 
    "It was noisy at night time, elevator took too long and breakfast items could have been a little better. On the other hand, Amir gave us Great customer service and Front Desk personal was very friendly and helpful. All the staff was attentive and tried their best to meet our needs.", 
    "This was our families second year staying at the Homewood suites and it was great! Check in was easy and the staff was very friendly along with the valet men always willing to help!room was very clean and loved that it had a fridge and microwave for quick snacks. There was a couple down falls that were irritating. The elevators are so slow and there seems to only be one working all the times it was very inconvenient when your trying to leave..we weren't the only ones that felt like this. The breakfast was great that it was free and very tasteful but there wasn't enough food and we had to wait a long time for the staff to refill items..That made the wait to be seated longer because people were waiting for the food and we had to wait to be seated when a table became free.Even with the couple flaws we will return again next year.", 
    "I wanted to take my two young girls for a weekend in the city this hotel was perfect! Nothing to fancy, close to everything, affordable... Perfect! The staff was extremely helpful and friendly. My only complaint was that the hotel had some wear and tear but overall rooms were spacious and clean,", 
    "I like very much my stay Great location Friendly staff, especially at front desk Thanks ", 
    "Great location, clean room, friendly staff. Only complaint is the laundry room dryers. I really think the vents need to be cleaned because the dryers took forever to dry clothes.", 
    "The staff was great, very welcoming, and friendly to my two little ones. The rooms are nice, give you a lot of options (with a kitchen, and pull out couch). You can save money and eat in. It appeared they would shop for groceries if you filled out the form. The rooms were a bit dated in some respects, but not enough to detract from the value of the location. Breakfast was full and warm with eggs, sausage, french toast and hashbrowns.", 
    "Used this hotel for a 2 day girls trip. Worked out well. Breakfast was good and the 24 hour coffee was great. I was looking forward to some hot apple cider but I missed out because it wasn't stocked. Free dinner on Monday night was very good. If you have long hair, you may want to bring your own hair dryer. Ours shorted out after running for about 20 seconds. It's a nice hotel with great service, good food, good location. I would definitely stay there again.", 
    "Fabulous location. Great service. Only thing was the WiFi.couldn't get it to work in the room. Was quiet and comfortable.", 
    "Great hotel, amenities and location. Easy access to all public transportation. Many shops and restaurants within walking distance. Wish pool would have been warmer.", 
    "Very helpful staff. Spacious rooms. Breakfast was nice.", 
    "Great hotel and service", 
    "Good value and very convenient location. Would stay here again.", 
    "We loved everything about this hotel but the lobby/front entrance. Location is great for Michigan Ave shopping and quick access to all the great restaurants.", 
    "Clean, comfortable, and within close walking distance of everything you could want or need. ", 
    "Everything was great - the location, valet service, the large suite and more.", 
    "Close to everything and perfect room for a family of three -- kid sleeps on sofa bed, parents get a bedroom. Free hot breakfast was perfect and convenient -- could use some stronger coffee (the robust blend didn't live up to its name), but you can't expect great coffee from a hotel, I guess. We hit the Starbucks across the street each morning anyway. Dinners at manager's reception were fine and a nice way to save some $$ for other touristy stuff while on vacation. Only downside was some construction noise overnight, apparently in the same building as the hotel, but not from the hotel itself. We were awakened with drillling/buzzing noises starting at 4:30-5:00am our last two mornings.", 
    "I loved Homewood Suites in CHicago. This is the first time I have ever stayed in this establishment and NOW i will not go any where else. After this trip, I will always look to find a Homewood Suites at my future vacation destinations. Loved the price, size, employees, location, on and on. Very satisfied.", 
    "Hotel was very close to everything downtown has to offer. Room was very clean and spacious.", 
    "Very inviting and helpful staff. Will definetly recommend and stay there again. ", 
    "Everything was great. They had a room available for us to check in early. Very nice when traveling. Didn't have to haul luggage around all day. All employees were very helpful. Rooms and hotel were clean. The location was very centrally located downtown. Good for walking almost anywhere. Only complaint was the bathroom door hit the toilet when opening and closing. All around a great value with the breakfast and managers dinner.", 
    "My husband and I came to Chicago to celebrate our 10th anniversary. We really liked just about everything about this hotel. They had a pool, free breakfast, a free dinner, free use of the gym and within walking distance to a lot of attractions. The rooms were clean and a lot bigger than some of the other rooms we've stayed in ( this was our 4th trip). We really liked that it had a full size fridge that we could put drinks and leftovers from meals in. The staff was super friendly and accommodating. We will definitely book our next trip here.", 
    "The hotel was in a good location. Our longest walk was to Willis Tower. It took 30 mins. Breakfast wasn't always hot. Sometimes a little on the cold side but overall tasted good. Some remodeling is needed. Carpet wear in some areas. Bathrooms need an exhaust fan. There was some black mold in the bathroom. But yes, I will stay there again. ", 
    "The Homewood Suites on Grand Avenue in Chicago was such a great place to stay! The staff were the most friendly and helpful people that I have ever encountered in a hotel! They made us feel like we really mattered to them. What a blessing we received from them. The breakfast and supper that is included with your stay was phenomenal! It was delicious, hot, and plentiful. This hotel is located in a wonderful area, close to everything. We will definitely be staying there again any time we go to Chicago! Well done Homewood Suites!", 
    "It was a good stay. I needed a train schedule for the subway to get to a White Sox and a Cubs baseball game and was surprised that the hotel did not have any pamphlets/brochures/train schedules/info. Other than this issue, it was a great hotel w/ awesome location and a great morning breakfast. I would recommend this hotel to anyone staying in downtown Chicago. rooms were very clean and the staff was very helpful.", 
    "Awesome stay. The room was very comfortable and the breakfast was delicious and staff very efficient. Had a great time! Location was very convenient to public transportation which made getting around great.", 
    "This was a fantastic hotel. Great price, great room, great food, amazing views from beautiful indoor pool (on 19th floor!). I was very happy with our stay. Staff was very helpful (gave my son a coloring book and crayons at check-in), etc... We will definitely be staying here going forward. The only somewhat negative thing I noticed was some partially frayed carpet b/w the bathroom and the bedroom. This could have easily cut by house keeping, but it looked like it had been there awhile. Again, the carpet didn't need to be replaced, but just that string could have been trimmed. Also, I asked for foam pillows and they sent more firm feather pillows. They did the job, but I would have preferred true foam pillows being available. So those are the only reasons I downgraded my 5 to a 4 in the category of condition or maintenance of the hotel. Otherwise VERY satisfied!!!", 
    "Great location. Close to restaurants and stores. Bring comfy shoes cause u will use them on your adventures. We would stay here again. Breakfast was another great positive!", 
    "We had a very pleasant stay. We arrived in Chicago about 6 hours before check-in time and when we asked to check our bags, they said they had our room available and checked us in immediately. Room was huge and very clean. There was one night that our door lock wouldn't let us in the room but maintenance was there under in under 5 minutes to fix the problem. Everyone was courteous. Great stay. Would definitely come back.", 
    "Loved the conveniences...fridge..microwave. Sofa bed much more comfortable with extra blanket to cushion the springs. Excellent housekeeping services", 
    "We enjoy going to Chicago as a family. Homewood suites was a great hotel and awesome location. We could walk to everything we enjoy doing.", 
    "This is a very good hotel with lots to offer, since it is a \"suites\" type of room (at least our room was) extra room, kitchen, etc. The free breakfast AND free evening \"dinner\" were a big help to the budget, although not gourmet, still very nice! Free internet is a savings, too, although it is not \"premium high speed\", it was ok. These extras may not be all that helpful for just one business traveler, but great for families. Location is just a block or two from Magnificent Mile and one block from the Red Line CTA train system. All the staff that we encountered were pleasant and helpful. ", 
    "Homewood suites had a great complementary breakfast and the children enjoyed the pool and it was close to the transit so we could get to any where we wanted to go", 
    "We live in Chicago and when we stay downtown it is usually splash out on getting away form the kids. This is not one of those places, but it is a great place for a more Unitarian stay. Excellent location, ample parking so you do not need to valet, ease access to the interstates and the rooms were amazingly clean and large. A surprise given the price, location and, generally, tourist clientele. I would definitely recommend as a place to stay downtown and have already recommended it to another person for a central family vacation homebase.", 
    "It's a suite. Great for families. Located in a great place, steps from the Mile, and surrounded by great restaurants and shops.", 
    "Great clean hotel. Staff at breakfast were so friendly and apologetic about the brief wait we had for a table. Pool was OK but had a nice top floor view. My husband tried to use the exercise room in the morning but all of the equipment was in use.", 
    "A great hotel and location. The team of staff at this hotel really understand how to deliver fantastic service, the front door team had a challenge to find me a large taxi for our luggage, the guy must have ran 500yrds down the road to get me the right car, now that's service! Would not hesitate to recommend and return. One of the best Hilton hotels we have ever visited. Roger & Jackie UK.", 
    "This hotel is in a great location. The breakfast was good and they sat people as tables open up. I was surprised to find out the lobby was on the 6th floor. There were only two elevators so you had to wait at times and then the elevators got pretty crowded. I had an issue with my ears hurting because we were on a higher floor and I asked the hotel if I could cancel my remaining reservation and they did without hesitating. If I had been able to be on a lower floor we would have loved to have stayed.", 
    "We stayed for part business/ part leisure. The suite was spacious. Staff very friendly. Excellent location 1 block from Magnificent Mile. Free hot breakfast buffet and free dinner Mo - Thur 5 to 7pm called Manager's Reception. Excellent value.", 
    "Central downtown location, close to food, shopping and local sites. Very clean and spacious rooms. Excellent hot breakfast. Very friendly and responsive staff. Great family facilities.", 
    "We traveled with our two kids (both under 10) These rooms have a great layout complete with a full working kitchen and living room area. We were able to bring snacks and there was plenty of space for the kids to play and set up their toys without taking over the entire room! With a door dividing the living room and bedroom, we could put the kids to bed and still have space to stay up relax while the kids slept. Great location, lots within walking distance, close to the free trolley stop and minimal cab fare to most main attractions. The hotel itself was a little dated but that didn't bother us, the staff, especially in valet area, were incredibly helpful and upbeat. The elevator was slow and very busy (only two to accommodate 17 floors of rooms and we think one wasn't functioning), that became a bit of a hassle but we just used the stairs since we were only on floor 9, if we had been on 17 it would have been more of a nuisance. We will definitely be back and recommend to anyone, especially those traveling with kids!", 
    "Very close to subway and great eating establishments. Very close to shopping as well. Outstanding free breakfast in the morning. Only problem was I specifically reserved a non-smoking room and we did not get one the first night. We went to the cub game and didn't check in until late. They couldn't move us because the hotel was completely booked. I was pretty disappointed because I booked this way back in February. The night manager said we would be moved immediately in the morning but when you are spending $300 per night - you want to be comfortable which my wife and I were not. I would also like to mention the manager have us a free night off our bill. I was really impressed with their customer service as well. This made up for the night in the smoking room. Overall the beds were comfortable and spacey rooms as well. We had a good experience besides what you read above.", 
    "We had a great time in chicago with our children. The hotel was in the perfect spot and we could walk to almost everything we planned to do. One of the elevators were broke most of our stay and the wait was long to get on. We stayed on the 19 th floor. Kids loved the pool, the view was beautiful, staff friendly, food good and rooms clean.", 
    "Traveling with my nieces on their first trip to Chicago, we had an all-around good time. Staff were efficient and friendly with quick valet service and check-in. We were pleased about the hotel's location near the shopping, Navy Pier, multitudes of restaurants, etc. The girls enjoyed the pool up on the 19th floor with a great view. Breakfast in the morning was good but waiting for a table was a bit annoying. The staff member that was trying to get everyone a table as quick as possible was doing an excellent job but has a difficult task. ", 
    "Rooms were clean and spacious. Staff was extremely friendly. There were many families staying so sometimes the elevator was slow or crowded. Free morning breakfast Buffett was convenient but didn't offer much variety day to day. ", 
    "Location was fantastic. Walking distance to everything. Public transit right around the corner. Restaurants, markets, shopping (Magnificent Mile) all within a five minute walk. Very safe neighborhood. Hotel was super clean and the morning breakfast/evening dinner was icing on the cake! Hotel staff were professional, knowledgeable and super friendly. We were new to Chicago and the hotel staff gave us recommendations that were spot on! My kids loved the indoor swimming pool and the views. I loved the cleanliness and convenience of the hotel. All rooms have a small kitchen which was well stocked and cleaned daily. The hotel price was extremely reasonable for the area and no hidden fee surprises. When we return to Chicago, we will definitely stay at the Homewood suites again!", 
    "I always try to stay here when i travel with my family for business. Is a good price, convenient location, separate living space so that not everyone has to go to sleep at once.", 
    "The location was perfect for our family, situated between John Hancock building and the river and just slightly west of Michigan Avenue. Easy access to train/subway station 1 block to the west. The staff was friendly and helpful. Was pleasantly surprised that there was a reception (dinner) on week nights on top of the hot breakfast that was included in the room rate. If Siskel and Ebert were rating it , it would be 2 thumbs up.", 
    "The location was excellent. The rate was okay. Some of the staff was friendly while others not so much. Parking was outrageous.", 
    "Overall good experience. Friendly staff, breakfast was pretty good. Location was great! ", 
    "Got to the hotel early. Left bags and car with very attentive and efficient staff. Walked to Nordstrom's. Practically next door. Then down to millennium park. And the theater district. All an easy 20 minute walk. Room was very nice. Skipped the complimentary breakfast, but it seemed ok. ", 
    "Rooms were clean and comfortable. Location was outstanding. Breakfast food was typical buffet - hot foods not very hot.", 
    "The hotel's location was excellent. The breakfast was adequate. Also, provided was free dinners from Monday to Thursday. The lack of gluten-free was a problem. Rooms were comfortable, being one bedroom apartments. Rooms were serviced daily and presented very well each day.", 
    "This hotel is located in the heart of Chicago downtown, just 2 blocks to the magnificent mile and the main atractions were within walking distance. The room was not big enough to accomodate a family with 2 kids (it is not a spacious suite). There is a fridge and a small kitchenette, if you prefer to prepare some food in the room. The hotel serves complimentary breakfast (every day) and dinner (Mon-Thu), however the area designated for breakfast and dinner is always crowded. You may use free wi-fi througout the hotel but you need to renew your connection everday. In conclusion, smaller rooms with basic suit amenities, superb location and free breakfast/dinner which may be a preferance for families with children. ", 
    "We greatly enjoyed our 4th of July 3-day stay at this hotel: perfect downtown location: only 10 min walk from Navy Pier and 2 min or so from Magnificent Mile, a large roof top pool, complimentary hot breakfast and dinner; spacious king suit with a kitchenette, a fridge and microwave perfect for a stay with kids; very friendly and helpful staff. Highly recommend for an extended or a short stay!", 
    "This hotel was perfect for this small town girl and her family. The location was walking distance from Magnificent Mile, Navy Pier, the bean and good restaurants. I felt very safe, and the view from our room at night was like a postcard. The free breakfast was awesome but get there early 7 -730 or you will wait in line. You can bring your food back to the room if there are no seats. There is a Jewel/Osco grocery store about a block away. Load up on soft drinks and snacks. There are no vending machines however there is a very small store that has bottled pop for 3.00. Kinda pricy when you can get a 6 pack a block away for 3.99. We took the water taxi to and from Union Station which made the experience even more fun. Make sure to go to the Science Museum...took the bus for 2.25 each. The front desk is very helpful in the trying to figure out which bus to take. Everyone on the bus is pretty much going to the same place so it is easy to figure out when to get off. There is also a free trolley to Navy Pier. The room was a bit outdated but the bed was super comfy and everything was clean. I would definitely stay here again.", 
    "Hotel is in a great location. Next to Grand stop on redline train. Took the train right from o'Hare to hotel. 1 block from Magnificent Mile. Bed was extremely comfortable but couch bed was HORRIBLE. It was all springs. Free breakfast was good. Free dinner, not so good. Lots of great restaurants and stores nearby. ", 
    "We had an amazing time staying at Homewood suites. The room was spacious and clean. Staff was friendly, and the hotel was in the heart of city. Close walk to the Navy Pier, major shopping stores, great restaurants, water taxis, and the riverfront walkway. The breakfast was great, but you should show up early before it gets crowded. They offer free dinner, but we were always too full from lunch to take an advantage of it. Free coffee, tea, and hot chocolate around the clock. The beds were very clean and comfortable, even the fold out couch was amazingly comfortable. The refrigerator has an ice maker so you don't have to retrieve ice from an outside ice machine. We had a blast and cannot wait to go back. We would definitely stay at this hotel again and again. This is a very kid friendly and pet friendly place.", 
    "Stayed at Homewood suites for my wedding anniversary. It was perfectly located, comfortable, and easy to get the car in and out. The complimentary breakfast was nice, and had more hot options offered than is typical. The staff was very friendly and helpful, even though they were booked solid. We had an excellent time. ", 
    "Very well located! Nice overall experience. Good breakfast", 
    "The hotel staff is very friendly. The complimentary breakfast and dinners were outstanding. ", 
    "Great deal in a great location!", 
    "Near Red Line Subway, Michigan AVE bus routes allows easy transportation to any place in Chicago. Neighborhood has many amenities, Blue rental bikes nearby. PERFECT", 
    "All staff were welcoming and attentive...and I mean all staff! couldn't have been more helpful! The birthday gift from the hotel was a nice touch for the birthday girl! The full breakfast was appreciated and the full dinner was a surprise! Great for families! Couldn't find a better location to roam around the downtown! will stay again...", 
    "The room was great. It had a kitchen. Breakfast and dinner were free and very good. The staff was friendly and helpful. Overall, a very positive stay. (We also enjoyed the pool.) Location was close to MI Ave and the Navy Pier. The free Navy Pier trolley stop was almost at the hotel door.", 
    "super clean and comfy In the center of everthing Navy Pier Michigan Ave all walkable we are going back in late summer with the kids and grandkids and this is where we will stay", 
    "EXCELENTE. Muy bien ubicado. Muy buen desayuno, bastante completo, frutas tocino, huevos, tostadas, panes jugos panes, cafe te chocolate yogohurt. Y lo mas sorprendente de lunes a jueves sirven cena de cortesia, GRATISSSS, de 5 a 7 PM la cual la puedes llevar a la suite y luego la calientas y la comes y te ahorras mucho dinero. Todos los dias un plato distinto muy ricos. La habitacion es enorme con kitchenet lavavajilla microondas anafe heladera platos para 4.

    "Excellent service and perfectly positioned", 
    "excelente estancia, cerca metro, y restaurantes y de la milla.", 
    "Our stay at the Homewood Suites was fabulous! The hotel staff was wonderful - everyone was helpful and nice from the doorman to the people helping out at their delicious breakfast. The location is ideal, very easy to get around. The kids LOVED the rooftop pool (of course). The rooms were a bit on the dated side (saggy mattresses), but for the price I really can't complain.", 
    "We really liked the convenient location to restaurants and sites to see.", 
    "Great location. Good breakfast. Staff was helpful.", 
    "Great experience. $13 cab ride to the Shed & Adler. Two rooms, with two TV's...doesn't get any better when you have kids. No hotel parking, but parking available less than one block away. In the middle of great restaurants and bars.", 
    "It was a nice hotel, beds weren't that comfy. Elevators had issues closing on ground due to high winds. Breakfast was ok. I enjoyed pool and fitness center!", 
    "The location, the staff, the service, the food, the facility.... everything was above expectation!", 
    "The staff was very helpful and friendly. They serve an excellent breakfast buffet and dinner too all included.", 
    "The staff were friendly. the location was wonderful, the amenities were well done.", 
    "We found a great deal on hotels.com for this hotel! The location was superb, centrally located to all major Chicago attractions. Great restaurants and shops in very close walking distance. The room was also just what we needed. Would stay here again.", 
    "Will not stay there again. Second day ran out of food one hour before breakfast ended, no room to sit for breakfast. Had to take the scraps thE scraps that were left from the buffet up to room to eat. Room needs to be updated. Pull out couch was like sleeping on springs with no padding. Worst Homewood Suite I have stayed at. With the prices hey charge, money should be used to update. Very disappointing. Will not go back.", 
    "Other than maybe needing to be updated a bit, everything was great. The staff was very friendly and helpful. Having the little mini kitchen was very nice. The location is VERY convenient. It's very close to michigan avenue, about a block and a half away, where you can also find buses to most touristy things, and the bonus is, the red line is just about a block away in the other direction. The breakfast is the typical hotel hot breakfast, nothing special. The waffles were good though. The pool was a decent size and seemed well maintained.", 
    "Location was perfect, 2 blocks from magnificent mile. $15 cab ride to museum. You can save $ by eating breakfast AND dinner at the hotel, (dinner is served mon-thur) but it was a step up from your usual little motels you see filled with kids...if it was just me and the hubby, I'd prob stay elsewhere... This is aimed at fams or extended stay people...", 
    "This was a great hotel for families. The location was perfect for all of our sightseeing and shopping. The staff was eager to help make our stay great! Nice pool, free breakfast and dinner :-) Great stay the only thing missing was the WiFi. It says free WiFi but we couldn't connect at all.", 
    "Great hotel. Very clean, great service, great breakfast. Friendly. Close to train system and river walk.", 
    "Great Hotel. It is close to shopping and restaruants. Front door staff very helpful, as well as the breakfast staff. Great breakfast. I never ate dinner at Hotel, but nice to have it available. Room is clean and the bed very comfortable.", 
    "Breakfast good with a nice selection. Was very busy but had plenty of seating available. Room nice w/ great views. Comfy beds w/ nice bedding. Room was very warm even when on lowest temperature setting. Parking outrageously overpriced @ $55 per night & valet guys appeared smarmy. Overall a nice stay.", 
    "We stayed here with our three young children and had a great time! The men at the front door were very helpful and kind! You can pull your car right up to the front door and they will park it for you for a competative rate and allow you unlimited exits and entries for free! We left our stroller and another item in the car by accident and they happily got them for us! We were very impressed!! Great location to kid friendly sites like Rainforest cafe and Navy Pier!", 
    "Staff was friendly, location and cost were perfect. I will always stay here when I'm in Chicago.", 
    "nice and friendly staff, very good parking serves, and reception desk providing very good information about everything we asked", 
    "Our stay at the hotel was totally outstanding. From the Vallet to the front desk we were greeting with smiles and warm hellos. The hotel was clean and the bed was so comfortable. Hot breakfast was delicious. It was an overall great stay and I would stay here again. Also, I would highly suggest this location to family and friends.", 
    "Overall, this location was very nice. Breakfast was a definite bonus and any staff we encountered were extremely nice. My only real con for this location is the size of their two room suites. We normally stay at another competitor that also offers two room suites which are larger in square footage. Bed was very comfortable, even the pull out sleeper wasn't that bad. All in all, I would definitely stay here again and would recommend to anyone considering staying there.", 
    "Nice hotel with decent breakfast and weekday dinners. Staff and valet extremely curteous!", 
    "We had a great time in Chicago and were very happy with our hotel. The room was very nice and the staff was very nice and accommodating. We were close to the Marriott where we were attending a convention. We were also walking distance from many sites in downtown Chicago.", 
    "There were many families there, we never heard them in the hallways. I think they put families separate form people who did not.", 
    "Wonderful staff, great location to walk to sights and shopping, loved the free breakfast and free drinks. Would definitely reccomend this hotel to everyone!", 
    "I enjoyed the stay at the Homewood Suites and found the location to be excellent. I stayed with a spouse and 2 children ages 14 and 16 who slept on the pull out bed. The breakfast was largely good and the afternoon snack similarly refreshing. I thought that the service was responsive and excellent. The coffee left something to be desired when the standard seems to be a richer brew and the pull out bed was not reportedly comfortable as a mattress. I would return and am appreciative.", 
    "This hotel is right next to Michigan ave. It is in the middle of many restaurants, shopping stores and there is a movie theatre very close. There is also a Trader Joe's behind this hotel where families can get something healthy without spending too much. The frontdesk stuff are very helpful, we never have to wait for taxi for over 1 minute! The rooms are comfortable. We all enjoyed the complimentary breakfast and dinner!", 
    "Breakfast area very congested, crowded...would have liked individual yogurts instead of in a bowl to scoop. Didn't like the flow of food presentation but, hotel overall was pleasant and staff very friendly.", 
    "My daughter and I went on a girls trip for spring break..Might I say, this hotel was AWESOME. The breakfast and especially the dinners were top notch. HOMEWOOD SUITES, taking advantage of the meals saved us a lot of money, and they were good, really good. Breakfast got a bit tight, but staff refilled things quickly, so no biggy... I cannot believe we were in the heart of Chicago and able to take advantage of a hotel such as this. We asked for a corner room away from the elevators on a high floor and that is exactly what we got. The view outside our room was spectacular! We were a few blocks from MAG MILE, took the bus to Shed Aquarium, took a nice long walk down State Street to Palmer House, took a cab to Second City, walked to Porcino's and did the River Walk. Hotel staff was so nice, we got spoiled quickly, Our room was spacious and clean, bed soft and comfy. We WILL be back!", 
    "Excellent location and serices.", 
    "Friendly staff, excellent hot breakfast provided in this well located suite-style, family friendly hotel.", 
    "Hotel was clean and kitchens very handy! They even have a grocery service that's free! Staff very helpful! I would stay there again!", 
    "Great place to stay in the city without expending a lot of money", 
    "Very Nice Room. Breakfast was AMAZING!", 
    "small room compared to most of the others, felt really cramped, the housekeepers never cleaned our room either we had piles of garbage that would never be picked up. inexpensive and good location. staff was not the friendliest.", 
    "The idea of small apartments in the middle of down town but with all the ammenities of a hotel it's great! If you keep in mind the location (you have everything in a radius of 4 blocks) its cheap! The staff is really nice.", 
    "Great room. Good breakfast. Great location.", 
    "They offered breakfast and dinner with drinks, it was awesome!", 
    "My family of four stated for a mini-get-a-way and really enjoy our stay at this hotel! The location couldn't hve been better, fair pricing and the room was very nice. The bellman was great and provided excellent recommendations for nearby restaurants. The continental breakfast was impressive and the staff was friendly. I would stay again!", 
    "From the valet parking, easy and quick check-in to the super comfy beds and DELICIOUS breakfast - this place was perfect for our weekend city get-away! The staff was helpful and friendly, the breakfast and 24-hour coffee bar were superb and the location was ideal! Thank you for making our quick weekend in the city super fun, comfy and easy! Can't wait to be back!", 
    "If you are in Chicago for a long stay. Great location", 
    "very small suite, extremely uncomfortable sofa bed. have to go through bedroom to get to bathroom. hot breakfast was good.", 
    "I stay a lot of hotels on a regular basis for business and leisure, but this stay was by far the most welcoming. The staff is amazing and treats you like family (at least the ones they like), the hotel provides complimentary breakfast and dinner (on most evenings), it's in a great location! I'll definitely be back.", 
    "We chose the hotel because of location, breakfast, the pool and b/c we wanted a suite. I wish the pool area had a hottub, or whirlpool, unfortunately it did not. I wish the fitness room had a fan, but it did not, and anyone who works out will know how quickly you heat up and how stuffy the room becomes. I was not allowed to leave the door open which made for an uncomfortable experience overall. The treadmill also seemed to be off its calibration (in case you are training for something). Love the fully stocked kitchenette. The sofa bed was decent. The king bed was heavenly. My husband and I didn't really eat any of the breakfast items, as there were hardly any vegetarian options. Kids loved it though. We had some very noisy neighbors who decided at midnight it was okay to open and close their doors loudly for 15 minutes non-stop. I called the front desk and within minutes they sent up security and it was nice and quiet again. Would we stay again? The location is excellent, but if they make a few mods it would be better.", 
    "Muy Buena. Cerca de todo. Se sentia uno como en casa.", 
    "I like the homewood suites hotel setup. I especially love the free 24 hour coffee tea and hot chocolate in the lobby. These hotels make you feel at home.",

    "Decided to stay here for a night while visiting Chicago. Location is great, we walked everywhere, but valet parking was expensive. Room was clean with a nice view of the city. Minibar and trays with water bottles are sensor based, so if you even touch it, you might get charged. Otherwise, no complaints.", 
    "Bed was clearly old or broken as it dipped in center and caused back ache. T.v. didn't work until 3rd day they fixed it. Phone rang randomly twice a day, waking me up. Too many hotels in Chicago to choose from. Although the staff waa friendly and otherwise service was good. I'd stay somewhere else next time. It is definitely a convention hotel (I seemed to be only person there not in a suit and name tag). The bar is huge and gets quite busy/ jammin for a hotel bar which was entertaining. Cocktails weren't cheap ($20 martini)", 
    "It felt like Atlanta or Houston rather than Chicago. Your first impression when you enter is that it's huge, impersonal, and noisy. It's particularly pedestrian-unfriendly, which is strange for Chicago: to enter the hotel from Wacker Drive, you need to basically walk through a parking lot. The staff was fine, as was the room. But next time I'm staying in the Loop, I'll get a smaller, cozier place, e.g., Club Quarters/River or Monaco.", 
    "I had a King Bed Ada Tub room but the guy gave me a 2 queen bed room. The in-room air conditioner was a bit noisy.", 
    "our room was in the back where they put some of the broken furniture. small room and small bathroom.", 
    "I had booked a rate that included breakfast. Upon check-in, they wouldn't let me remove the breakfast upgrade. It was a bit disappointing, but the breakfast was fantastic!", 
    "My husband and I stayed at this hotel from 5/8/15-5/10/15. The staff was excellent. Our King room was spacious and newly remodeled. The only issue we immediately noticed is that the walls are quite thin. There was a family in the room next to us and we could hear their children whenever they were in the room. In all the hotels I've stayed in, I've never experienced walls so thin. Also, whenever people were talking in the hallways...it sounded as if they were in your room. On the other hand, this hotel couldn't be in a better location! It is right on the Magnificent Mile, countless restaurants, navy pier, Millennium Park and lots more. If you can get past the thinness of the walls, then this is honestly an excellent place to stay! ", 
    "Close to everything! It was also nice to have options for food and drinks inside the hotel.", 
    "Brought my girlfriend to Chicago for a weekend and this hotel was so convenient to everything! I would go back and stay in the same place! ",

    "This is my second stay in three months, the first for the American Library Association convention and the second for Society of Midland Authors conference. I had no idea that the second conference was being held at the same time as the NFL Draft celebration. So the city was congested. The Hyatt was like an oasis, well at the edge of all the activity. Check-in was a breeze, there is always a staff member helping to expedite the line. The gentleman who checked me in was pleasant and, even though I arrived well before check-in, put me in a quiet room after he discovered I'd been traveling since 5am. My room, a king deluxe in the West Tower was comfortable, and meticulously clean. The linens and towels were crisp white. The bathroom was sparkling. I wouldn't advise a car - parking is expensive. Instead I arrived via airport shuttle and took cabs or buses to my desired locations. Breakfast in the morning was well prepare (although I do miss the Panna Cotta they served in January). One note - during the buffet there was an odd meat everyone was avoiding - it was labeled \"kielbasa\" but looked like bland oval potato cakes. That was a \"miss.\" Otherwise the buffet had plenty of excellent options including smoked salmon and made to order omelets. The waiters were attentive The location on Wacker is perfect, close to Grant Park, only 2 blocks from Michigan avenue, and a short trip over to Navy Pier. What's not to like? For future trips, this will be my top choice in Chicago.", 
    "Great location! Right on the Chicago river, walkin distance from the Navy Pier, the Bean and the Magnificent Mile. ", 
    "This hotel is in a great location in a central position for the Loop and the Mag Mile. The staff are very friendly and helpful and the food was delicious. The room was lovely, clean and spacious. The only thing I would say is the lobby area is very large and impersonal, but this is a minor point and could be a positive to some people. I would highly recommend this hotel for business or tourists.", 
    "We had a fantastic stay. The checkin/out process was extremely easy, staff very accommodating, and the hotel was gorgeous. The only complaint was the price of parking my vehicle there overnight, but it was expected. The staff was very prompt to have my car ready whenever needed. We were able to check out at noon, pack my vehicle, and keep the vehicle at the hotel while we explored the city, which was really nice since we didn't have to worry about parking somewhere for the day",

    "Was disappointed when we arrived that rooms we reserved online were not available. One of us had to sleep on the floor the first night since no roll away beds were available either. Not sure why you reserve rooms and pay with credit card if they are not available. The second night of our stay I had to call and ask for roll away bed and was told they have one they will give us at no charge, making the second night a little more comfortable. Location was great. Restaurants in hotel were over priced for food you received. ", 
    "Nice central location, clean newly renovated rooms. Beds are OK, nothing like my Duxiana at home. Parking is crazy expensive ($63/day), more than my rental car. ", 
    "My girlfriend and I visited Chicago for 4 nights at the Hyatt Regency Chicago. It was a really nice hotel in a great location. The only bad thing I can say about this hotel is that the walls are pretty thin and you can hear people talking in the hallways. All in all I would definitely stay here again.", 
    "Hotel is beautiful expecially bars and lobby. Bed was comfortable but could never sleep well because we would wake up sweating. We turned air down as far as possible (65) but it apparently didn't work and just couldn't get any air circulation in the room. It was 40-50 degrees outside and we would sweat in our room with the AC on. Also don't request a fridge in your room because they don't tell you that it costs $25 but thankfully took it off our bill because we were not aware and didnt even end up using it. Don't drink at the Big Bar. Drinks are very watered down and nothing but sugar (because they are so big), but food is very delicious. ",

    "Rooms are large, staff very helpful and a good location. Would highly recommend", 
    "Was nice hotel, will stay again. Will recommend also", 
    "Convenient location to many tourist attraction and reataurants.", 
    "Great experience and hassle free place to stay. Near the water and within walking distance to many things we wanted to see.", 
    "For a hotel with the Hyatt Regency name on it, I was very disappointed. I was expecting more. Not anything major was wrong but a lot of little things added together made the stay worse than it should have been. 1. The in-room safe. This is the first hotel I've stayed in for a long time where the in-room safe was NOT laptop compatible. A person assumes that when the hotel website mentions a safe in the room that it's laptop compatible...99.9 percent of them are these days since almost everyone travels with a laptop. I have a little 13\" Macbook and it was twice as big as the safe. And this is supposed to be a business hotel with the Illinois Center next to it. 2. The room was arranged all wrong. Couldn't even watch TV without hurting my neck sitting on the bed or getting a sore tailbone due to the very very very uncomfortable chairs. Also, they are using a universal hotel remote for the TV as most hotels do but on this one, half the buttons didn't work. 3. The Marketplace (for quick snacks and coffee) was really expensive. A small cup of coffee and a pastry costs more than at Starbucks, and that's saying a lot. 4. Had to ask to have the \"complimentary\" toiletries in the bathroom replaced. Shouldn't have had to do that. 5. WiFi was very unreliable. Sometimes it worked great and other times, no go. Like I said at the beginning, nothing major but put all of these pet peeves together and it's makes for a bad stay.", 
    "This is a very nice hotel with many offerings. However, parking is extremely expensive!! ", 
    "We had a great time overall, the only downfall was the doormen threatening to tow our car because it wasn't parked in the right spot. Maybe you should have more signs up as to where to park when your guests are checking in. First time ever that I've had a hotel threaten to tow my vehicle when I wasn't parked in the right spot. Needless to say they didn't see a penny worth of tip money on the whole trip. Otherwise it was a great hotel.", 
    "I was in Chicago to visit a friend and booked the Hyatt on E Wacker not sure of the area and I'm so glad I did. Close to everything! From Garretts Popcorn to the Shattuck Aquarium, it was all within walking distance.", 
    "I was offered an upgrade for an extra $20 a night and was so glad I said yes. I couldn't stop looking out the window at the beautiful city lights. Travelling solo, the location was perfect! The room was clean and the bed super comfy!", 
    "Our bathroom wasn't clean front said they would clean it right away. They didn't I had to clean it. The bath tub was full of hair. It was nasty.", 
    "I went to Chicago only two days with my family. We loved the hotel, it is modern, comfortable and the staff is kind. The only issue that we had is that we were 3 adults and they gave us a 1 bed room.", 
    "There was a card that stated, put down what you need from the cleaning people. I put down needed a razor from day one and never got it. I wonder if my \"care card\" will be the same for the next guest.", 
    "I didn't let it affect my review because everything about the hotel was excellent! Breakfast, staff, room, view, bar, location--everything was great. I personally like the location for proximity to millennium park and north Michigan ave, right in the middle of both. My only \"buyer beware\" / negative was the fidge / snack bar in the room. Im not blaming Hyatt as it's my own stupidity, but $11 for a small can of peanuts!? Come on man.....! Spent $52 on just a couple beers and some peanuts. Byob..", 
    "I want to show the hotel's parktodaying aria front oh the hotel. I made a resevation \"two queen beds\". But when I cheked in the hotel, staff asked me \"would you like one bouble bed?\" I answerd him,\"No! I made a reservetion two queen beds.\" He said to me \"Your room is a one king bed.\" I stayed one king bed. I could'nt understand why the staff asked me one double bed and why I stayed differebnt room. ", 
    "The hotel is clean. The staff is friendly. There was a great great bar. The bar tender was very creative and super friendly. The hotel had great restaurants and the selection of different food and atmosphere is awesome. The hotel is centrally located which makes it easy to walk to different venues.", 
    "Great hotel that lives up to the Hyatt reputation.", 
    "Great location. Despite the very busy weekend, very friendly and totally professional staff. ", 
    "Hyatt staff person, Jason, made my moms first visit to Chicago amazing! We had a room with a wonderful view of Chicago. Thanks for making our stay very enjoyable.", 
    "Outdated rooms, old TV's not HD. They put us in the wrong room and would not make any accommodations to fix the issue of 2 guests not having a bed to sleep in, except send a roll away for only one of the people and charge us extra for it. ", 
    "Very clean, staff was extremely friendly and helpful, and the breakfast buffet at American Craft was fantastic. Plus or 6 year old got to eat free, always a plus. ", 
    "We visited Chicago for a family weekend and were nicely surprised by this property that is in heart of Chicago and walking distance to Millenium Park and all the great shopping on Michigan Ave. we got a great rate and so it made sense to be there!", 
    "Affordable price good location. Large hotel but wasn't noisy. Room was clean, a bit hot (even with AC on full blast). \"3 days in Chicago\" Must do activities - Magnificent Mile, Cloud Gate, Millenium Park, Lincoln Zoo all FREE. 360 Chicago (19 USD per adult) great views. Drive to Toyota Park to watch a MLS soccer game. Catch a baseball game if possible. Must try bars: The Drifter (secret entrance - basement of The Green Door Tavern at bottom of stairs behind the bookshelf). They have burlesque/entertainment for $5 cover at scattered times throughout the night. It's a very casual but intimate bar with great cocktails and snacks. Booze Box (basement of Sushi Dokku on W Randolf Street). Wasn't a huge fan of the popular restaurants - Girl and Goat , Little Goat...I'd say stick to other areas of Chicago, Randolf street was a bit pretentious (similar to Toronto's King West but smaller).", 
    "All the staff was friendly and professional and quick", 
    "Booked this hotel at the last minute and it was wonderful. Great central location. A little hard to find the underground parking because my cell phone kept losing reception under the bridge. Room and all of the hotel facilities were top notch. It is a huge hotel but the staff were able to handle it and were very helpful and accommodating. There's a great small Italian restaurant with deep dish pizza right around the corner. ", 
    "We are in the center courtyard restaurant a lot. On the nights they had buffets, the food was amazing! Great buffet menu and price. Great staff there too! Sterlings was extremely overpriced.", 
    "I was only there for one night on a business trip. The single king room was quite spacious and comfortable. There was an issue with the cable when I got back to my room that evening, but the front desk sent someone right away (even called back to verify that they arrived and fixed the issue) and it was repaired quickly.", 
    "My stay in Hyatt Regency Chicago was very pleasant. Staff was super supportive. The room was very nice and clean. It was a business trip, so I had no time to visit a fitness center, and I did not explore the hotel's dining options. Yes, I recommend this hotel to business travelers.", 
    "Hotel was very clean and has excellent views from rooms ", 
    "Overall, I had a very good experience at the Hyatt. The lobby, sitting areas, and restaurants are all top notch. I appreciated the underground connection to various eateries during the cold winter days. The staff members are very friendly. The gym facility, although somewhat small, was very clean and I appreciated the towel service (and the free apples on occasion!). The room was small, but cozy. However, I did have some problems sleeping due to the fluttering noise of the fan. ", 
    "It was easy to book our stay. We got a room within 10 min of arrival at the hotel. Stay was comfortable as room was spacious having all amenities one may require. Booking out was simple. Hotel facilities were comfortable.", 
    "Great location and nice lobby. Wide open space, feels like you are outside, great lobby bar. We at at restaurant and the service was awful. We were told we couldn't order breakfast/brunch at 11:02am on Sunday morning as it was now \"lunch hour.\" They then said they would make an exception and gave us the breakfast menus but pushed the $26 buffet. When we opted for bagel sandwiches instead of the buffet that had been sitting out we were told that due to the exception we could only order the buffet or the basic two eggs and toast. We opted for the second option and desite our annoyance the food itself was good. The server came over to apologize for his changing story and proceeded to not pay attention and pour coffee on my eggs. When we were ready to leave we asked another server for the check as ours had disappeared and we were told we needed to tell our server....Shortly after we went to the valet to pick up our car that we had called 25 minutes prior to for and were told they were busy and we'd just have to wait....Nice hotel, don't expect 4 star service.", 
    "Beautiful hotel with a great location. Friendly staff and great amentities. We will definitely stay again soon. ", 
    "Was visiting the American Beauty show @Mccormick. The hotel I have stayed at several times. Always clean and friendly staff. ", 
    "No problems......everything was very nice. We enjoyed our stay.", 
    "The staff were very helpful and friendly. The hotel has been refurbished recently so everything looked very new. The room was very big and there was a desk with a chair plus another a pair of leather covered seats. The room was clean. Some people might be put off by the cost but you do get what you pay for. There was plenty of staff around when I checked in and out so I didn't have to wait. I had several excellent meals in the hotel restaurant. I wanted to find out how to get to Lincoln Park zoo and the concierge was very helpful. The hotel is alongside the Chicago River and very close to the Trump Tower and really easy to find. I needed to borrow a pair of scissors and the hotel was pleased to oblige. I had reason to spend one more night in Chicago the following week and stayed at the hotel again. ", 
    "Loved it amazingly beautiful enjoyed my stay there and will be back soon!!! ", 
    "We were in Chicago for one night. Booked here because we planned to shop Mag Mile and then shops along State Street. Hotel is located perfectly within walking distance between both. Fun atmosphere, very helpful staff, comfy bed! Work out facility is great, fun bar and relaxing sitting areas with great views.", 
    "The hotel is nice & our room was clean, but they charged me $5.30 for a water which we didnt drink so I had to call & have the charge reversed. Also, we valeted our car. The valet card suggested you give them 15-20 minutes to bring your car around. I called down at 10:45 AM for my car. We went to get car about 15 minutes later. We ended up waiting an hour for the car & I spoke to 3 different valet employees, but they couldnt find my car. I was in a hurry to leave & didnt check my car when they finally brought it. It has a dent in drivers side rear door & I cant get them to call me back to addresd the issue.", 
    "We walked the entire city and was always able find our way back to the hotel. Centrally located and staff was always amazing with any questions. ", 
    "We only wanted to check our bags when we arrived at 8am, but were pleasantly surprised when we were given an upgrade and able to check in at that early hour! The clerk asked if we were there for a conference and we replied , no girls weekend for my 50th birthday! The breakfast buffet was wonderful! It was included in our package! The concierge was fabulous with info about where to watch the St Patricks Day Parade! Staff was friendly! Can't wait to go back!", 
    "Overpriced and not worth the pay especially for what we are getting in return. They placed some snacks next to the television and it wasn't clear that eating those will cost us 50 dollars (for literally 1 M&M, 1 small Pringles, and one small box of cookies). The ground was also not very clean and there were clipped nails on the ground from a prior guest. Definitely didn't meet our expectations.", 
    "The hotel lobby and restaurant was LOUD due to some tile work and drilling, not a very relaxing environment! But will look nice when it's done. Room was just fine, serviceable and clean.", 
    "its not the first time for me staying at the Hyatt Regency hotel,they are always the best of every thing, and it's always the priority hotel to me.", 
    "Great if efficiency and business ready is your purpose. Big but not a place for R&R.", 
    "We have stayed at that Hyatt previously and enjoy the location, but since the extensive reno's it's even better. Staff were helpful, and you could tell they are trying very hard to please... The Big Bar is still an iconic meeting place, great vibe and view. I'd definitely return to that hotel again...", 
    "it was verry good the food break fast. it was nice", 
    "Nice hotel setting but didn't like the $63 valet parking fee that wasn't mentioned until check out!", 
    "Cost to much in Garage. Hotel was Great good location. good Bar.", 
    "Hotel was pretty good. Within 5 minutes walk to Millennium Park, and a short stroll in to downtown for shopping attractions. Despite being a non-smoking hotel, the first room we checked in has a terrible smoke odour, but the hotel staff were quick to act and moved us without any fuss at all. Great service, and would definitely stay here again. ", 
    "Went to Chicago for work and brought my kids and a babysitter. Everyone was pleased with it. I had my clients meet me there and they commented how nice the hotel was too. Would love to go back to the hotel. Only issue was the ice machine wasn't working on our level, but they quickly brought me ice when I told them.", 
    "$10.81 for a bottle of water in your room. $63.00 a day to park your vehicle. A little much for a city with the highest crime rate.", 
    "It was good.", 
    "Comfortable Hotel close to the Millenium Park. Room big and clean with most important things available, but not very unique.", 
    "We attended a dance competition for my granddaughters dance studio. The great location and the accommodations made this a good place to stay. We found alternate parking at Millenium Park ($25/day) to offset the hotel parking of ($65/day) just a ten minute walk.", 
    "was very dissatisfied with the hotel. Not very appealing.", 
    "Weekend trip for my wife's birthday. Great room for a great price.", 
    "Rooms have been renovated.", 
    "We enjoyed the hotel and restaurtants. Location was great for moving around Chicago.", 
    "Very nice hotel and a lot of dining options. Elevators were terrible!!! 10 to 15 minute wait times to and from the 12th floor. Very disappointed in that part", 
    "We had a cozy room with a beautiful view of the river and skyline. Almost everything was pretty much within walking distance or it was incredibly easy to grab a cab from the front of our hotel. The conceriege was very helpful and gave great recommendations. ", 
    "Great place", 
    "Our radio didn't work our bed sheets had pet hair the room Smelled like someone had been smoking in it there house keeping bothered us hours before Check out time and the expensive horrible breakfast buffet sucked and all They offered to accommodate the horrible night was more Reward points this place really Down graded ", 
    "Everything was amazing from the simplicity of checking in and out as well as the layout of the facility. The only unsatisfying experience was ordering a cheesecake togo from American Craft Kitchen and Bar. The bartenders helped everyone except me and I sat there for atleast ten minutes. I have served and been a bar back for three years so I am far from being an inpatient person. Two bartenders serving a bar that seats proably 20 people should have beable to help me much sooner especially if a couple sits next to me and gets service in 30 seconds. ", 
    "Very good experience. Would stay at the Hyatt Regency again.", 
    "My only complaint was the the bathroom door was a sliding door with frosted glass that did not fully seal when closed, so it was lacking in privacy. Otherwise, it was a perfect place to stay!", 
    "Great hotel and location. Would go back. Very clean, great bar in hotel, nice views.", 
    "only one word will describe my feeling . i love this hotel.", 
    "i strongly recommend this perfect hotel for all type of travelers. everything around this hotel. i would like to thank the staff for their effort.", 
    "Great staff and friendly service, clean room and convenient to everything downtown.", 
    "Very nice hotel. Staff members were pleasantly accommodating and genuinely helpful. Room was clean, comfortable, and convenient to the downtown Chicago area.", 
    "Really great place to stay. Near all of downtown attractions. Very convenient.", 
    "We loved the hotel and location!! We will be returning soon!", 
    "Definitely a top notch hotel. Excellent customer service, very nice rooms, comfy bed, fun bar, good food options, easy check in/check out", 
    "The Hyatt was a very good hotel, especially for the business traveler.", 
    "Recently stayed at the Hyatt Regency during the American Library Conference. I read the reviews here and on TripAdvisor that suggested if I had purchased a discounted room I'd get a closet size room. I took a chance anyway and did a blind bid on Expedia for a four star hotel at a reduced rate. I couldn't be more pleased. I received a large king size room on a quiet floor. The bathroom was meticulous. The bedroom was spacious. We ate breakfast each morning in the restaurant and it was comprehensive including omelettes, multiple egg dishes, bacon, pancakes, kielbasa, smoked salmon, the usual breakfast fare replenished frequently, fresh fruits and yogurt, oatmeal, more pastries than I can count and a large cereal bar. Be still my heart - they offered Panna Cotta for breakfast. It was fabulous. During the snowstorm (also the night of the Super Bowl) they offered a buffet for a bargain price which was pretty large had multiple meat and vegetable options, salad, three soups, and a full desert bar. Internet in the room is for purchase. We used the access in the lobby instead. It was fast and free for hotel guests. Don't take a car. Parking is expensive. Taxi's to get around is less expensive. If you take the subway it is about a 10 minute walk from the Lake stop. Would definitely stay here again", 
    "Very disappointed, hotel holds so called security without return with no reason, ", 
    "In town for a convention, the Hyatt Regency was a great choice. Staff were welcoming and accommodating, putting me in a quiet room in my requested tower, and then, when the 'blizzard of 2015' hit great with advice for where to eat and how to get around (or not, for those people whose flights were cancelled or delayed.) This will definitely be my first choice for my next trip back to Chicago.", 
    "goed, maar niet schoon en vooral teleurstellend dat er geen gratis internet op de kamer was", 
    "A very good hotel in an excellent downtown location. Everything is as you would expect a Hyatt to be.", 
    "We really enjoyed our stay here. The staff were very friendly and helpful with anything from answering general questions to their recommendations on things to do and places to eat. The only issue we had is we paid extra money to go up a few floors and get a better view but the view was only good if you were right at the window. There was one chair but no room for another which would have been nice since there were two of us and a toddler. The rest of the view in the room was of the two building next to us. We were so tired from driving all night we didn't push the issue but wasn't what we expected. Other than that we would definitely stay there again.", 
    "Nice place. Great room. Will stay again!", 
    "Great hotel! Right next to the blackhawks store. In Walking distance of shopping and food.", 
    "Excellent hotel. Perfect location in downtown Chicago. I would stay again.", 
    "We love this hotel and are repeat guests. The rooms are large and comfortable, the food is excellent, and the service is always terrific. From housekeeping to room service to getting us cabs, everyone was friendly and helpful. The food is great and we love the Big Bar. I only wish that the pillows were more comfortable.", 
    "Everything was awesome about this hotel. It would be nice to have got a couple of complimentary bottles of mineral water. That would have been a nice touch. Also, they should probably keep shower gel as well as bar soap in the bathrooms. Otherwise this hotel was the best I had stayed in. Amazing views of downtown!", 
    "Had a great experience and would stay there again.", 
    "We were here for the AKA Karate tournament and found the hotel very accommodating and clean. It was very easy to move from the room to the convention center and back to the room. ", 
    "Clean comfortable room, with a great view of the river. Highly recommend. Although breakfast is crazy expensive.", 
    "I have no complaints expect that valet parking was a tad over priced. $67/night for parking! However, the hotel amenities and location made up for it. I loved how there was 24hr conveince store in the lobby with great coffee, smoothies and healthy snacks. The gym has everything you need and it's also 24hrs. ", 
    "It was very comfortable", 
    "Wish there was refridgerstor space and a microwave ", 
    "This was my first time staying here since the had done the renovation and its great. Perfect location for leisure or travel. The room was a little bit smaller than most, but the price, location and amenities make up for it", 
    "Amazing, beautiful, clean and comfortable!", 
    "I was there for business. The hotel is newly remodeled and gorgeous. Up to date and hip! I love it!", 
    "I was there for a conference and the entire experience was very well organized. This was my first time staying since the renovation a few years ago and I was very impressed. The addition of the marketplace in the lower lobby was very helpful for meals at odd hours. Also, the gym is much improved.", 
    "All good. Disappointed Internet wasn't included and was extra.", 
    "Really bad. Terrible travel experience. 1. The waiters in restaurant never greet. When I went there for breakfast, I told him, \"orange juice, plz.\". He said ok. But I waited for 30 minutes. The waiters there are like deaf persons. 2. Internet never works well. I paid, it was expensive. But it does not help. Cannot watch anything from web smoothly. 3. Always forgot to clean my room. ", 
    "Perfect. Wanted to stay longer", 
    "Great place to stay. Unfortunately, I came to town for a funeral. However, the price was good, the location great, and the room very comfortable and clean. Pros: comfortable, clean, good price (stayed in Jan.), good cafe downstairs with reasonable prices for breakfast. Cons: $63 per overnight parking! We parked elsewhere and walked back to the hotel - seriously. And, the sign says they care about conserving water - so I hung up my one towel and bathmat, which meant they should have left them alone. They changed them anyway. Not so committed.", 
    "Great Experience, very nice hotel!!! Excellent view!!", 
    "Ideal for large meetings or conferences. Convenient downtown location. Staff were outstanding; very friendly and helpful. Room was comfortable, although the bathroom wasn't cleaned thoroughly.", 
    "We had a lovely nite on a cold and rainy January nite in Chicago at the Hyatt Regency. Great room and superior brunch!", 
    "Nice hotel with a pleasant staff. My room was small, just two queen beds a bathroom and tv. No microwave or space. Free breakfast is not offered but a bar, store, CVS and restaurant is right downstairs. Parking is $63 per day, not sure if that's expensive it average because its my first time in Chicago. Hotel is about 30 mins from O'Hare. ", 
    "Wonderful, no complaints.", 
    "Excellent", 
    "Loved the location and service.", 
    "We booked this trip last minute for New Years Eve 2015 so 0 research was done for our stay. I am happy to state that we were more than happy with the staff, service and the over hotel. We did have some problems with checking in, that caused us to be charged twice for the room. Our credit card showed declined so we paid cash, upon checking out this was noticed and we were refunded the difference. Also small issues with the room it had not been updated in some time other than an Ipod docking station. The room could have been cleaned better but had been surface cleaned (lots of dust on head boards tv etc.). Over all we were happy with the stay.", 
    "Great friendly staff. Very polite, courteous and everyone greeted you :)", 
    "The neighbourhood is REALLY awesome: you really get to access many of the Chicago's most famous attractions within walking range, like SkyDeck, Millennium Park, Mag Mile, Theatre District etc.", 
    "It's a big hotel in walking distance of all main attractions, such as Magnificent Mile, Navy Pier, Art Institute, Millennium park, several theaters; we even walked to the museum campus. However it's a 7 minute walk to the blue line subway station. It was very cold when we stayed there last time, and I would prefer to have station a bit closer. As in other more expensive hotels, one has to pay for internet access and for parking. We stayed in a room with two queen size beds, which were pretty comfortable. There was no fridge in the room. Otherwise all amenities were provided. There is a small convenience store in the hotel (in the east building) where one can buy fruits and drinks. Or one can just cross the river and find everything in Walgreens.", 
    "Excellent price for room and breakfast buffet added. Great view without needing the upgrade upcharge. Would definitely stay there again!", 
    "This was a getaway trip. From check in to concierge and bell captain, everyone was wonderful. In particular, the help and guidance from the concierge was outstanding! They found a great jazz club and immediately set up a reservation and made it smooth and easy to get there and enjoy. Other directions and guiding advice made this a delightful trip.", 
    "Excellent location for the price. Visited during winter maybe price was low due to the season", 
    "We stayed New Year's Eve. The hotel in general is very nice, elegant lobby, things to do near by. However, our room, was very cold! This is winter in Chicago, we stayed on the 9th floor with a view of the city. Yet, the huge windows in the room basically made the heat not work. We called the mechanic to come fix the system, but it was still cold, we slept with many layers on till it finally warmed up. I would recommend requesting a room not on the exterior.", 
    "Well, the hotel is nice and the location is perfect. This was my second time staying there.. and we had a blast. The hotel is like a little city and is very entertaining. Room service was cheap and the staff was friendly. Unfortunately though, the hotel tried charging me outrageous fees at checkout. I was charged a $59 valet charge wihich made no sense because I didn't have a car! Plus we booked a room for 4 adults and was given a great rate through hotels.com. At the end of our stay, the hotel said we owed an additional $50 a night for the extra adults in the room. All that said, the hotel waived the fees after arguing with them for 20 minutes, but I was still disappointed it happened. I felt that this must happen alot because the guy acted like it wasn't a big deal and didn't seem to care I was upset this wasnt disclosed before checkout. Debating if we'll stay there again, which is unfortunate because it really is a nice place in a good location in downtown chicago.", 
    "Nice-convenient location! Easy access to downtown! Highly recommended!", 
    "Carpet in room was filthy there was so many Cheerios behind the doors as if no one had vacuumed the room. Side table dusty window not cleaned moved side chair in room only to find no one have moved it for a while dust stain around it room over all small n dirty. Floor was not even their was bumps throughout the floor. Staff was extremely nice and courteous", 
    "Pricey valet but otherwise everything was wonderful.", 
    "Stay was ok, extra tight security on New Years. Room wasn't prepared properly, lotion and soap were used.", 
    "I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone. The room was very spacious with a big bathroom and a big window with a great view. The staff was extremely helpful. The one downfall is they don't have a mini fridge. Just a heads up don't take out or move anything in the mini bar. It has a sensor and you will be charged. I was very impressed and will definitely be staying there again. ", 
    "We stayed at the hotel for New Year's Eve. Loved it! We were very impressed with how seamless the experience was from check-in, to the service we experienced at the \"Big Bar\" and concierge desk by Renee, the security check point (which was extra due to New Year's Eve) and check-out. The location is great and we had an awesome view of the river from our room! We would definitely recommend this stay to others!", 
    "Hotel had a very nice, open feel with lots of options for food- even for a vegan which isn't always the case. Room was nice and spacious. Staff very helpful and friendly. Very satisfied. Would book again.", 
    "This is our third time staying here. Great customer service, clean rooms, nice location! This is one of my favorite hotels in Chicago.", 
    "My stay at the Hyatt Regency was absolutely amazing. I went there on New Years Eve to celebrate my birthday with friends. When arriving we received wristbands to enter the elevators to our room, safety reasons. I thought that was acceptable since it was on such a busy night for everyone in the city. The room was spacious and clean. The only thing is unless you are willing to pay extra do not touch anything in the fridge or on the front table. The view was nice! All in all, it was a well spent getaway! Thanks", 
    "unplanned girls road trip to Chicago .. loved the hotel and would stay there again..", 
    "Our room was very small and had an overwhelming musty and mildewed smell, like the carpets had been cleaned and not fully dried. For a hotel rated excellent, it was a disappointment. We will look elsewhere next time we stay in Chicago.", 
    "Excelente", 
    "My first experience at the Hyatt was a fantastic one! i will definitely be staying again. The staff was incredibly helpful, and check in was a breeze. A great place to spend a night in a beautiful city!", 
    "Staff was helpful and accomedating. Great location.", 
    "THIS WAS A GREAT EXPERIENCE WE DID ENJOY IT VERY MUCH. ONLY A COUPLE OF COMMENTS, THEY DID NOT PROVIDE ON A DAILY BASIS THE SOAP AND SHAMPOO, THE INTERNET WAS ALSO NOT INCLUDED AND THERE WAS A DAILY CHARGE FOR IT AND I CONSIDER FOR THE PRICE OF THE ROOM THIS IS A MUST, AND TO BE HONEST I DID NOT REMEMBER IF WHEN I DID THE RESERVATION, THE BREACKFAST WAS INCLUDED AND IT WAS NOT", 
    "Staff were very helpful the hotel was very clean ... in I felt very safe", 
    "We had a great week together here. I think it's normally a business hotel, but it served us very nicely. Nice fitness room, comfortable bed, very low noise. More than one restaurant in the hotel. And everyone we talked to, front desk, waiters, house keeper, were all very nice and helpful.", 
    "This hotel is beautiful and the location is excellent. The beds have luxurious pillow tops. The bathrooms are beautifully lit. The view of the river was amazing!", 
    "loved this hotel! It was close to everything we wanted to do. Nice lobby bar to unwind at after shopping. Even though the hotel is huge, the rooms are quiet. Rain and sleet forced us to take more cabs/Uber rides but due to location even those were all very reasonable. Definitely will go back. ", 
    "The only bad thing was the \"24 hour\" store closed at 10:00pm. I had to go to Walgrees or wait for room service to bring water. Other than that, very nice and comfortable hotel!", 
    "Simply Perfect", 
    "Perfectly located with easy walking distance to everything. It was clean, nice and beds were comfortable. The bar is fantasticWe were in the West tower without a view, but we also spent very little time in our room, so it didn't really matter. In general a good hotel for the money.", 
    "cleanliness of room", 
    "Great view of downtown and good location near Michigan avenue. Staff were very attentive, friendly and helpful. Room was spacious and quiet", 
    "This is one of the best Chicago hotels we've stayed in, and we have stayed in many of them over the years. We are impressed by the fact that in spite of being a huge hotel, it has managed to be friendly and cozy. All staff members are obviously taught to be friendly and caring with guests and that tells us that the management is really professional. We love the fact the there is room service 24 hours a day... our kids really loved it. It gives a feeling of luxury and relaxation. The location is obviously perfect and close to all activities in town (being basically in the middle of mag mile). This will be our choice next time we come back to Chicago.", 
    "We went for a family Staycation to the city to enjoy the holiday decorations, ice skating at Millenium Park, the Blackhawks store, and good deep dish Chicago Pizza. This location was an easy walk to everything we wanted to enjoy.", 
    "Great location and near every point of interest in the Windy City.", 
    "The hotel was excellent and in a great location. The only negative was that the bed was not the most comfortable, a little hard for our taste. Otherwise, everything was spot on--service, cleanliness, amenities.", 
    "The overall stay could have been better if the staff was friendlier. The front desk was rude and after paying for our hotel room we were charged for wristbands to get back into the hotel we had already paid for. When asking an employee who was doing nothing to take our groups picture they gave us a nasty look and acted as if we were asking them a huge imposition.", 
    "Thought we were getting a room with a view of the river high up (the REASON we booked the hotel)but got a room on the third floor with a view of a side road. Would also have liked the option to carry our own bags to our room. Parking was very expensive but it was a good location for shopping.", 
    "Very friendly staff. Very accommodating. Wonderful views of Lake Michigan. Comfortable mattresses. ", 
    "We had a wonderful time! Hotel was clean, quiet and close to many restaurants. Walking distance to many shops!!!!", 
    "The hotel is conveniently located in walking distance to Millenium Park and Michigan Ave. We ordered room service one night it was good and quick. The only downside was our room was so cold, they sent a technician up right away to take a look but that was no help...aside from that the hotel was great room size, views, and comfy beds", 
    "'Smooth check in & out. Actually, got our room at 12 noon. Very nice location and nice staff. Hyatt..impressive. Loved the price of room and location. Not a fan of the struggle for parking, thus hotel parking cost a fortune.", 
    "The room was a little bit dusty, but it had a great view of the lake. The best part about my stay was the comfortable bed. I can't wait to visit this hotel, again!", 
    "Our room was on the first floor, next to the fire station. It was a bit noisy each time the station got a call. The steak restaurant in the hotel was fantastic!", 
    "The room was clean and very nice from the furnishings to the toilets it's tub was great.", 
    "Great location. Across river from magnificent mile. Very courteous staff", 
    "Loved the location and the view even though we were only on the 7th floor. ", 
    "This hotel was absolutely terrible and I would never stay here again. We ordered room service, it never came. DO NOT eat in the hotel unless you have at least two hours. The service was absolutely terrible and super slow. You have to pay $59 to park per night, which they don't tell you upfront. The hotel staff are all rude. I will never stay at this hotel and I would never recommend this. ", 
    "Really nice service", 
    "We reserved a king size bed, but we're given a queen size bed. The room was TINY. My college dorm room was about the same size- not an exaggeration. This is because we were assigned the room that shared its spase with the stairwell. I assume there is a room like this on every floor. They would be better off using that space as a janitors closet, not assigning it to guests! The furniture in our room was not of highest quality. The sink in the bathroom sprayed water everywhere, and some of the other furniture(like the desk) had scratch marks. Our television was fuzzy and seemed to have trouble maintaining a picture at times. I don't know if this was due to a poor cord connection or if it did not have good reception, or what. Needless to say, we were rather disappointed with our room. The location of this hotel in the city is beautiful and right next to wonderful shopping and excitement. We only stayed one night. When we brought our concerns to the front desk at check out they graciously offered us their buffet breakfast (a $60 value). The breakfast was AWESOME.", 
    "Overall the stay was very good. The outside river/lake view was owesome. We requested the refrigerator and never got it.", 
    "Stayed here many times. Can't beat the value, view and location.", 
    "It was amazing my fiance and I loved it", 
    "Frequent visitor to this hotel due to its location at the end of Michigan Ave. Within walking distance of all attractions. Its a little big though with the different towers. Renovations make it a bit sterile but all in all its a great location so you don't feel like guests are sitting on top of each other.", 
    "I parked my vehicle through the Valet and once I discovered the parking for overnight was $59 I left my car and took cabs to where I needed to go. The breakfast \"buffet\" would rival the cost of the finest restaurants on an Easter brunch, but this was just any Monday morning. The breakfast cost me $55 for two.", 
    "they made ever one were a little plastic bracelet like little kids and if you lost it it wuold cost you $20.00 each one of coarse my kids lost there when we went out for new years and they would not let you to your room till you go and buy a new one even if you left on in your room what load of crap they need to fire the manager how came up with this ,. this wa not know to us till we check in just shove this down us at check in no were else to go on new years. no stars ", 
    "I had a very good time at this hotel. All the staff were very nice and helpful. I am very glad that I picked this hotel. I visited the fitness center two times a day and it was fantastic. All the equipment were very clean. ", 
    "The hotel over all is good.. But hotel room at the regency club is disappointing. For the money i paid for the room is not worth. It looks like a standard room in a small town hotel.. Carpet is old, bathroom is small. The front desk is terrible!! For a high end hotel, i would grade it F. The front desk looks very cheap, ceiling is so low. The design is terrible!!! It looks like an airline counter. The front desk of a motel 6 is a lot better. I would go back for food and restaurants. But not to stay as guest. Thank you . ", 
    "This is a good place. I would recommend this for anyone who want to visit Chicago. It's in the middle of the town.", 
    "We had a very nice stay. I read the reviews so I knew not to touch any of the food or drink items so I wouldn't get charged. Our room was very clean and roomy. The staff was very nice and accommodating. Morning brew your own coffee in the room was Starbucks which was nice. It was nice to have a quiet, comfortable, and clean room to come back to after a busy day on the town. Food at the Stetsons restaurant in the hotel was very good but pricy. We had a nice view from our room. I was pleased with our choice to stay here. ", 
    "Great location! We could walk around to do lots of eating, shopping, and site-seeing. The hotel staff were very kind and helpful! They also had a later check out time than we're used to and that was really nice!", 
    "Cannot believe how nice this hotel was considering the price we paid. The lobby is gorgeous, hotel staff was amazing and our room was huge! First time in Chicago I can definitely say it was the nicest hotel I've ever stayed in! Definitely recommend. Travelled 12/29/13 - 1/1/15", 
    "We had the best time. We had a front desk lady tiffany who brought us champagne and strawberries for our anniv. Wonderful everything!", 
    "Wonderful location,nice environment and great services (include valet parking).", 
    "Internet service and ballet parking were a bit expensive, but it was a great stay.", 
    "Great location right down town near many attractions. Found parking garage for reasonable price just one block away.", 
    "We are a family with tall teenagers, therefore, I specifically selected a room with double queen beds when booking the hotel. When we got to our room, after a long trip, we learned that the beds were not queen size but full size beds and the receptionist at the hotel did nothing to change this. We were told that the Hyatt calls their double size beds, queen size. Had we known this, we would have selected another hotel. Also, we were given a handicap room with very little drawer space to place our clothing. The hotel is well located but the internet is extra charge. If you don't mind what size of bed you get in your room, then this hotel should be fine.", 
    "Fantastic location, friendly staff, great access to city", 
    "We came to see Newsies but wanted to enjoy Chicago's wonderful atmosphere. The hotel location is wonderful for walking to great shopping, Millenium (spelling?) Park, Navy Pier, and the Oriental Theater. The staff was very helpful, friendly and informed about Chicago. We loved the food options in the hotel. We enjoyed the Marketplace for coffee and breakfast. Our room was clean and comfortable. We would stay here again!", 
    "We walked from train station, walked to Water Tower Place.Loved your location. Fantastic experience", 
    "Stayed overnight after attending an event,hotel room was very spacious and clean, service was excellent.", 
    "My wife daughter and I stayed here to visit the Chicago museums as our Christmas gift to ourselves. This Hotel is considerably more classy than we usually get but it was the right price for our budget. The room was very comfortable. The bed and the pillows were the best ever. You have to be careful about the minibar and the snack tray. They have automatic sensors and if you even move a bad of potato chips you may be charged for it. Also, I wasn't impressed by being charged 9.95 for 24 hours of internet service.", 
    "Very professional staff, nice facilities and great location. ", 
    "Stayed here because we got a $79 holiday rate and our son didn't have enough room in his apartment.", 
    "Our room had two connecting rooms. One room had our other family members, but the other connecting room was not. They were very loud and the noise was annoying when they returned to their room at 5:00am.", 
    "Nice hotel. Like a black nasty dirt in the glasses but not a big deal. They fixed it. Great place.", 
    "The hotel was not cleaned very well, it was very small. It did have a great view, and friendly staff. Not a hotel meant for a family to stay at, more for buisness people. ", 
    "we had an excellent stay. All of the staff was more than eager to help us with any of our questions. Highly recommend this hotel", 
    "Trip was fine. Hotel in pretty good condition, good service. Only complaint is please get rid of those chairs in guest rooms. They look great but are the most uncomfortable chairs I have ever seen. The chairs in the common area on the second floor better.", 
    "great location, good service and facility, room is a little bit dark, room service is slow...", 
    "This hotel is one of my favorite places to stay in Chitown. Best location to walk anywhere and comfortable.", 
    "Every time I stay at the Hyatt the whole evening is excellent. Despite the fact that this hotel is huge, they get you right through on check-in. There was a small problem with the elevator and even though we were on the 30th floor as soon as we clicked on the down button, they had someone there to take us down the service elevator with a slight delay. Great customer service and the price is great for the location.", 
    "Beautiful hotel. And friendly staff", 
    "Stay was great. However, I cannot understand why valet parking is must. It is $59! It would be 30 at most.", 
    "Checked in . Lobby looks like an aorport terminal, not inviting at all .. Then got to our room great view !! But after 4 hrs in the room we killed 6 big black spiders ! Um groose , they moved us to another room and gave usca 50 credit ! But my card still has charges pending where they charged me for 2 rooms . So fighting that still .", 
    "We enjoyed ourselves. The hotel is very pretty and conveniently located to downtown shopping", 
    "Staff at check in were very friendly, room did not have the best view and the maid service was average at best. There was a print out about guest services on the desk which was wrinkled and used by the prior visitors in our room while they did not replace our towels and I had to find someone in the hall way to request more towels. Towels we did use were spread out over the hooks in a messy fashion after they had cleaned the room. "

    "I was in town for a quick very busy weekend. I got in town at 8 am and it made a huge diference to accomodate me , car and things before the check in time at 3 pm. Great place", 
    "Loved this hotel. We had a great room! Staff was very nice and helpful!", 
    "Very good hotel- offers a complimentary wine hour every day which is really cool. The rooms are decorated really fun and have pretty good views. The beds are comfortable.", 
    "I stayed at the hotel for five nights. I was very impressed. ", 
    "The hotel was great, the on-site restaurant is way over priced and the menu is limited. The first two items my wife ordered were not available. My steak was tough. Net, stay at the hotel, don't bother to eat there.", 
    "Everything at this hotel was wonderful - the room, the staff, the location. We'd forgotten a razor, a toothbrush, and a phone charger and were provided with all, free of charge (the charger was a lender). Our toilet was leaking just a tad and when reported they had someone up to fix it in minutes! I'd go back any time. :)", 
    "Will definitely stay here on next trip to Chicago ", 
    "great location and very confortable,my family love it.", 
    "The staff were friendly and helpful. Unfortunately the room seemed as if they rushed through the cleaning with dirty glasses in the bathroom, hair on the pillowcases and an obviously very quickly made bed. Also a heads up that paying for overnight parking only gets you until 2pm the next day no matter how late the previous day you parked. Would recommend you self park in one of the nearby ramps and get a 24hr pass. It also must be said that the comfort of a hotel bed is always something to look forward to but this bed left me wishing id spent money elsewhere. Oh yes wifi is not included in your room fee even though it says it does!!!", 
    "We had such a lovely stay here. The staff were friendly, welcoming and helpful. Sheila and Richard were extremely helpful in helping me to arrange a birthday surprise for my husband even before we arrived in the hotel. The room was spacious, clean and comfortable, offering a range of services and little additional touches. This was the best hotel stay I've had in a long time.", 
    "This was my first time staying at this property. I was pleasantly surprised. What great place. The room was very large, bes so comfortable and the window seats were just the coolest thing! The bathroom was enormous, and the water pressure was great. The staff was very helpful and friendly. We enjoyed the bar and restaurant. Food was excellent. I will be staying here again.", 
    "We stayed in a king room with river views. It was amazing! We looked out of our window to see the river and the Trump tower. Our room was a good size and the staff were so helpful. We didn't want to leave! ", 
    "Hotel was lovely and right in the middle of a lot of great stuff, however, I was not prepared for the ridiculous overnight parking fee for my two-night stay. I expected a charge, and even asked upon arrival how the parking worked, but staff alluded my questions and made it sound like the hotel would \"take care of it\" when I turned in my ticket. I was very upset that it cost $116 and wasn't warned on the website or by staff so I could have chosen to stay elsewhere or park elsewhere more affordable. Do not assume that people expect that type of charge. I was willing to overlook the price of the room each night and taxes with very few amenities for how lovely it was, but add the parking and I felt OVER charged.", 
    "Staff was helpful and friendly. Beds were very comfortable, decor was awesome and the room had a great view of the river. Would definitely come back!", 
    "We stayed at this hotel to go to a concert at the Chicago theater. We were able to park in a parking garage about a block away. The Chicago theater was just over a block away which made it easy to walk to. There were good restaurant options close by as well. The hotel and room were very clean and the staff was friendly.", 
    "Very large room. Excellent bed. All staff members were friendly, professional, and polite. ", 
    "Close to Chicago's most important attractions like the millennium park, museum of art, and Michigan Ave. Complimentary wine hour everyday, and compliantaty coffee and tea every morning. Elegant decor, and friendly staff. Would definitely recommend it and stay in it again. ", 
    "We stayed here on a Sunday. Service was great & staff was helpful. A lovely perk is that they had a hot chocolate bar in the afternoon as well as wine in the evening. Since it was snowy & cold, that was a perfect addition to our stay. The room was large & quiet. I would absolutely return!", 
    "Great location, friendly staff. Love the 5pm wine hour in lobby.", 
    "I loved Kimpton hotels and this one was no different. The service was excellent and the room was incredibly comfortable. The window love seats are a really cool touch and I enjoyed sitting there. Would stay here again, especially for the price.", 
    "Had a wonderful stay! The hotel staff was very friendly and helpful. Some guests were partying in the room next to us and the front desk staff was very accommodating of our request to be relocated. Will definitely stay again. The windo seats are awesome!!!", 
    "This was just a one-night business trip and the main office is on Lake Street - so all worked perfectly. Thanks - and I look forward to staying with you again.", 
    "We enjoyed our stay. We were celebrating our anniversary and they sent complimentary sparkling wine, strawberries and bath salts to our room. We were upgraded to a view room. Very nice touch. Staff very helpful and friendly.", 
    "Left an important item in room and realized this only when I was at the airport. Called and for immediate response and assistance. Loved the ambience and service . Centrally located", 
    "First time staying at a Kimpton hotel and it will not be my last! This hotel was extremely affordable and conveniently located right in the middle of most of the places we wanted to visit. We were very impressed with the room, with the sole exception being the bathroom as it seemed a bit run down compared to the rest of the room. We made the free wine social each night from 5-6 a priority. FREE WINE! It was quite tasty, and hot toddies were also offered (and also free). If we had a child with us, not sure we would have chosen the hotel since there was no breakfast. However, as a couple this place was fantastic and we will be staying here again.", 
    "Hotel was very nice, room was very organized thank you,The only thing that I had a little issue with was at night the trucks in the back you could actually hear them", 
    "Excellent in every respect. The room maid left an animal made from a towel on our bed every day.", 
    "Good value for room, as long as not facing west toward the very noisy loop trains. Attached restaurant - stay away.", 
    "Nice location, large room, comfortable bed, great overall.", 
    "This was a beautiful hotel with respectful, friendly and helpful staff. The bed was very comfortable and the room beautiful and clean. I especially enjoyed the window seat with view of the river and city. The location was good. Just out of winter walking distance to the Grant Park area, but an easy cab ride. I found the valet parking to be well worth the $58/day price. I just left the car and walked or took a cab to where I needed to go for stress free touring. Museum campus and Grant Park are not far. Lots of great restaurants close enough for walking or a short cab ride.", 
    "Our stay was great. I travel frequently around the world for business, and chose Hotel Monaco for personal travel due to the small \"boutique feel\" of the hotel. The stay there always seems personalized and comfortable. The front desk staff and bellmen were very gracious and helpful.", 
    "Stayed one night for business. I love Kimptons so always look forward to them. This one is nice, but nothing particularly special for the brand. Very friendly and helpful staff, but the room was just good (sorry, Kimpton, you get graded on a curve).", 
    "We enjoyed our stay here very much. The only downside was the heater seemed to not work very well and the room was a bit cold. Other than that, no complaints.", 
    "Spacious room (King City View) with space for 2 + 50lb dog. Great pet amenities: food/water bowl, pet bed, treat welcome package, listing of groomers, sitters, and local dog friendly attractions. Friendly staff.", 
    "The room was as described, except the promised view wasn't. hile I was thinking about this in my first minutes in the room, the front desk called to see if everything was to my liking. I mentioned my impression and they immediately offered to move me to a higher floor with a better view. That was much better. However, the mid-rise across the street is undergoing a huge renovation and they start using their very loud construction elevators at about 6am. Comfy bed though! The windows had cozy window seats and big pillows which were great for curling and taking in the improved view and the skyline. The hotel restaurant was limited. The lobby is really lovely and the wine hour was a really nice touch. Big glamorous armchairs by a fire and fun people watching? Sign me up. The gym is fairly well appointed, but there are no kettlebells and the free weights only go up to 50. There are med balls, but I think they only go up to about 15. There are ample towels and bottles of water and sanitizing wipes are available for wiping down equipment. The bathroom was spacious and properly appointed, but I wouldn't call it luxurious. It was however scrupulously clean. There is an umbrella in the room for your use, which was a nice touch. The housekeeping staff does a great job in keeping everything perfectly clean.", 
    "We were always welcomed very warmly at the Hotel Monaco, and the bed was extremely comfortable. It was generally a fine stay. It's not at all a flashy place, and it could easily be a very old building that's been updated (hard to tell one way or the other). The only downside was that our room overlooked an ugly alleyway; it was a very slow weekend in Chicago and they could have probably put us on the other side overlooking the river, but we didn't ask and they didn't offer. Perhaps those rooms were a higher rate class, or being held for their frequent visitors.", 
    "Very comfortable and lovely ambuance. Will definitely return. Great location and loved the window seats!! ", 
    "This was our first trip to Chicago. Walked to the hotel from the metro station (easiest way into the city without a car) and it was easy enough to find. Even late at night everyone was pleasant. The hotel did not ruin our trip, but for what we paid I was expecting more The pros -bed is lovely and comfortable -roomy closet -room was large and comfy -carpet felt clean on bare feet -thermostat was easy to adjust and reacted quickly -staff was pleasant and accomodating. -Location was fantastic The cons - it was freezing outside and they stopped providing hot water for tea and coffee after 10 am- its ridiculous. I have been to a holiday inn in the south where you can always get a cup of hot tea. -No way to make hot water in the room -the bathrobes are lovely but would only fit a model. I am a size 10 and 5'11\" and couldn't fit into one. -I called down for extra towels and they never came-see next item -If you take a shower, it will flood the bathroom. Even after making sure the curtain was pulled tight to keep water from going out- we wasted 2 large towels trying to keep the floor dry so we wouldn't go slip and sliding. -moulding on the floor in the bathroom is cracked and needs to be replaced. For how much we paid I expected better. -Few out of our window was of an adjoining roof and ac unit -Our room was right next to the AHVAC system room- constant drum of noise 24/7 The room we were in really should not exist ", 
    "We received a bill the next morning from the front desk for a lesser price than our stay was through hotels.com... We basically got overcharged. Parking was also not included in the initial charge from hotels.com... Very irritating to find out we got over charged for our room along with them needing to also pay th hotel an additional $58 for parking... Irritating", 
    "The hotel is okay but is not a four star. $58 for valet parking, very mediocre but expensive restaurant, and they stop coffee at 10am so you pay $6 for a cup anytime after. The rooms are nice but not plush. ", 
    "Best staff at the hotel. Always offering to help and giving advice. Hot chocolate time was a plus! ", 
    "Great staycation", 
    "Fab!", 
    "This was my first time staying at Hotel Monaco, but I'll definitely be staying there again. A large room for downtown Chicago and it was very clean. The location was perfect if you are looking for a place around State St. Only a block from the state/lake \"L\" stop. The staff was awesome and very friendly. The coffee, hot cocoa, and wine hour was a great plus after coming in from the cold.", 
    "We have stayed at the Monaco numerous times. Cozy boutique hotel, great price, great location. We discovered it with our dog, it is a dog friendly hotel, yet you wouldn't know it except for the cute pups walking around. I know there are many great hotels in Chicago, but we feel most at home at the Monaco. Highly recommend it and they often have GREAT price deals.", 
    "Great location - very consistent brand (I prefer Kimpton hotels). Only downside is that this hotel is a bit \"worn\" in places, mainly the bathroom. The tub is old and baseboards / tile was very worn. Other than that, it was yet another fantastic stay at a Kimpton hotel. I will absolutely continue to stay at Kimpton hotels in the future.", 
    "great location, amazing staff!! Beautiful, affordable hotel!", 
    "My family loved this hotel. The windows in the rooms where amazing I couldn't get the kids out of them or husband;) The beds were very comfortable and the bathroom was huge. We ordered breakfast and it was delicious. The staff was wonderful the doorman walked down the street in the rain and hunted us down a taxi. We will definitely return and recommend this hotel.", 
    "Hotel with personality, great location. Wonderful view from top floor room. Very affordable.", 
    "Big, beautiful rooms, and the bed was amazing! Perfect location to walk to great sights, shopping and restaurants.", 
    "Great location near everything. It's a very interesting decor, and the hallway smelled like cigarette smoke, but everything was very nice and clean. Also the free happy hour was a nice bonus.", 
    "We had a great time staying at the hotel. The staff is friendly and most helpful. Our room was amazing and very clean with an awesome view of the river. We will stay there everytime we visit Chicago. ", 
    "The perfect hotel for a perfect getaway weekend in downtown Chicago.", 
    "Last minute decision to stay in Chicago so grabbed a hotel room here and had nothing but the clothes on my back great to have everything I would need right there for me to use in the room toothbrushes,razor ect ect that is great and I hope to see this in more hotels in the future. Keep up the great work.", 
    "Good points: Location is great, close to State St and Michigan Ave. Bed confortable. Bad points: room is small. Bathroom is dated and extremely small - no counter space for toiletries. No view. Could hear street noise all night and noise from hallways. Bar in hotel was awful. The drinks were awful.", 
    "I love the wine tasting also and The free coffe to go is also very good ", 
    "Great trip! Room was very comfortable, and the front desk staff were very pleasant and helpful. We always enjoy the Kimpton evening social time.", 
    "Had a great time at the Hotel Monaco. Wine reception every evening at 5 pm was fun. Easy to get around town. Awesome view of the river from great little reading nooks. Staff was very gracious. Rooms haven't been updated in quite some time, but still not ugly. We arrived incredibly early (930 am) and were given a room when we got there, almost unheard of (even if they have them~ they often won't let you in).", 
    "An excellent hotel centrally located for shopping, restaurants and sightseeing. Friendly, helpful staff.", 
    "Came downtown for one night and stayed at Monaco because of location to Chicago theatre. It was a great experience and we would definately stay there again.", 
    "We loved every moment from the doorman to relaxing in the window seats with our wine. Highly recommend this trendy boutique hotel that hosts a happy wine hour from 5 to 6 daily. Great location with a 3 block walk from the blue line loop from Ohare airport. Enjoy your stay. We will be back. ", 
    "The entire stay at this hotel was wonderful. It was clean and everyone that worked there was very friendly and able to help whenever they could. I would definately stay there again on our next travel to Chicago. Would recommend to anyway!!", 
    "I was in Chicago for a one night stay for a business trip in the Loop. The hotel was well located for my meetings. My room and the public areas were all lovely. Any of the staff members I came in contact with were pleasant and helpful.", 
    "Whenever I'm in Chicago, the Monaco is my preferred hotel. The staff and amenities are great as is South Water Kitchen. Walking distance to my train and my office--perfect!", 
    "The room and service were great. I would recommend to others.", 
    "I will be back soon, the hotel was in a great location, the service was excellent, and the rooms super. Thank you! ", 
    "Great staff, great location, funky hotel. Rooms not huge but extra comfy and quiet. Can't fault the place.", 
    "Excellent hotel, location, staff, and service. We stayed at this hotel for a week and loved everything about it. We will definitely be booking our next vacation stay at a Kimpton Hotel.", 
    "Great hotel within walking distance to nearly everything. View great, staff friendly and room, although not huge, was super comfortable and quiet. My 'go to' hotel in the future.", 
    "You have to love the Kimptom hotels! I was first drawn in by the offer to have a goldfish in your room when we visited Seattle years ago. I love the contemporary decor and colors! The afternoon wine reception is always a plus. We had just a basic king room here without a view. That is the only drawback I can point out. I suspect we could have paid more for a room with a view. ", 
    "Everything was excellent! Best hotel we have ever stayed.", 
    "Great stay. Thanks. Comfortable. Clean. Great location. ", 
    "Clean and updated. Modern with an Art Nouveau feel. There was a wine reception each night in the lobby which my husband and I enjoyed to kick start our night out on the town. Within walking distance to lots of shopping and great restaurants. Staff was very curtious and friendly. We would definitely stay here again.", 
    "We were looked after very well during our stay. The doorman (Antony, I believe) was especially helpful and welcoming, as was the concierge. She not only set us up with dinner reservations and a great blues club but also helped us with some color printing issues. You can't beat the complementary wine hour every evening!", 
    "Friendly helpful staff and excellent location. Room was clean and nice but bathroom was disappointing at this price. Small amount of mold in grout in shower was present but otherwise bathroom was very clean. The next day after leaving, I called the hotel and lost & found 3 times looking for phone accessories possibly left in room but was unable to get a response or call back from anyone at hotel.", 
    "Stay was overall very pleasant. Unfortunately I left 2 items in the hotel. One was found (although after 2 calls and insisting on re-checking) and shipped to me. Other was never located and was lost to me. Neighborhood was noisy.", 
    "Location is absolutely brillant: on the river, walking distance to pretty much everything. Nice hotel in great condition with friendly staff. Only downside is the next building under massive construction which means week days early wake up...", 
    "My stay was wonderful even though I was mislead when booking thinking I was getting something I wasn't.", 
    "Everything was great. We generally just did our own thing but the staff, particularly Michael on the door and Jonathan on luggage would be a great asset to any hotel. Wouldn't stay anywhere else in Chicago ", 
    "I selected the Monaco because I am a fan of Kimpton hotels. I was disappointed with the Monaco, though. It felt like an old Sheraton that was glossed over with some new wallpaper and somewhat funky furniture.", 
    "Excellent staff, very pleasant.The room doors are paper thin and allow too much noise, even though I was at the end of a hall.", 
    "I once set a personal goal to stay in every hotel in Chicago for one night. I have been to about 30. I have since abandoned that goal. I now prefer to stay at Hotel Monaco whenever I am downtown. Besides having an ideal location, it is moderately priced, quiet and serves free wine at 5pm. Perfect.", 
    "Great location and a cool vibe to this hotel. I will be coming back the next time I am in Chicago!", 
    "We went for the Marathon and we have been really pleased at the Monaco", 
    "The hotel is in a fanastic location, get the river view room. They have a large window seat to view the river and the city. It's within walking to many major attractions. Restaurants are on site, but there are also many great restaurants outside the hotel doors within walking distance. My only gripe is that I booked this hotel via Expedia and the hotel won't honor the Kimpton Points because it was booked on a third party site. It will definitely change my view on where I stay in the future because I was a loyal Kimpton customer, but to not credit someone because of where they booked is absurd. I still stayed at their property and I'm sure they still got $$$ from Expedia for the booking. Seems minor.", 
    "A nice break from the Hilton, etc. large-scale type of hotel stay. Staff was very friendly and helpful, and the rooms were well appointed and comfortable. Pros - comfy bed, free internet (w/ membership sign-up), central location. Cons - a little noisy due to proximity to L tracks.", 
    "Loved this hotel! Staff was very helpful with our car, bags, restaurant recommendations, special requests, etc. Loved the window seat in the room - nice place to relax, see the river and activity below. Beautiful decor. Room was quiet, except for expected city noise from the streets below. Restaurant (South Water Kitchen) was delicious for breakfast! We left our car with the valet and walked everywhere for 3 days! ", 
    "Could be better with some renovation", 
    "It was a very nice stay. The location was perfect. My only issue is that my card was double charged for parking.", 
    "We enjoyed our stay in this lovely boutique hotel. Very comfortable and very convenient for walking to several eating places.The concierge was courteous and helpful. The Manager's wine reception a pleasant surprise. We will stay there again.", 
    "Awesome hotel experience, just didn't expect the $58/day fee to have my car parked there. Not cool on that. Otherwise, excellent service and great location to stay, with a reasonable $150/night room rate that I paid.", 
    "It's a welcoming hotel - I arrived just as wine time began, and they were keen for me to join in. Room was big and clean and warm and quiet. A few small things could have been better, but nothing to spoil the stay. Staff were helpful. And what a wonderful location.", 
    "Super Hotel, senstaionelle Lage!", 
    "Love Hotel Monaco. The staff always makes you feel welcome and give you the impression that they are glad you are there! What could be better?", 
    "I came here for my birthday with a couple of friends, and this hotel was just perfect for the occasion. We only stayed one night, but days later I still miss our room. The room was standard, but very spacious with noticiabley high ceilings that added to the comfort. Noise levels were low. The mini bar was stocked well. Water pressure excellent and shower easy to use. The hotel is updated but didnt have a cold modern feel like some places tend to have. The decor is cute, and gives it a nice boutique feel. After this impromptu stay, I was pleasantly surprised with the hotel and would stay here, or any other Kimpton hotel again. Thanks!!", 
    "Great staff excellent location terrific service from the bell hop to front desk special call out to Erica she made our weekend special with her attention!", 
    "Love the window seat. Rooms were very nice and bed comfortable.", 
    "The staff was fantastic, the room immaculate (they got us in for wine hour at the last moment!). Decor was a little offbeat but I guess that's their thing. I give four stars only because there were no plugs at the nightstands. These days, that is a requirement.", 
    "Rooms were larger than most downtown hotels. Hotel was close to shopping, eating, and entertainment. Less than half of the channels came in, the toilet didn't flush right, and even after paying for WiFi had trouble connecting multiple devices.", 
    "Enjoyable stay. Staff was very accommodating. Hotel conveniently located and within an easy walk to restaurants and shopping.", 
    "tres agreable sejour a chicago les gens sont chaleureux une tres belle ville donnant sur le lac Michigan ", 
    "We were very happy with this hotel. Great location, clean rooms, friendly staff, nice restuarant connected to the hotel. Loved the little window seat!", 
    "Nice and clean, staff was really nice. Great location, everything in walking distance.", 
    "Overall great experience. The first room I was given had a great view of the river and city, but was facing the street. There was too much noise from the nearby subway (which is above-ground in that area). But the hotel staff was exceptionally accommodating in allowing me to change to a different room on the opposite side of the hotel which was incredibly quiet and comfortable. The staff was exceptionally friendly and helpful. I would definitely stay there again. Great location - right in downtown Chicago and within walking distance to gorgeous Lake Michigan. ", 
    "Convenient to Trump and top 10 places to visit in Chicago", 
    "Our first stay at this hotel and would highly recommend. We will definitely look for this hotel throughout our travels. Clean comfortable rooms, friendly and helpful staff and centrally located within all Chicago sight seeing venue. ", 
    "Good hotel which is centrally located for downtown Chicago. Although the reception is not grand, room was very comfortable. I would rate it top of the range for a 3 star hotel. ", 
    "The hotel was close to everything and the staff was always on the ready to give us directions and recommendations. Was a wonderful stay and will definitely tell all our friends.", 
    "Staff was very accommodating! Enjoyed our stay very much. Highly recommend this hotel!", 
    "It was a nice stay everybody was nice and very helpful. My wife and I are fairy thankful and will definitely be back. Thank You", 
    "I thought the hotel lacked amenities for the price", 
    "If it's available get a room with a water view. One of my favorite hotels ever!", 
    "Great location for touring the Loop area. The train is close and grabbing a taxi was a cinch. Lots to do within walking distance too. Traveled late August. Have never been in Chicago in summer. So much to do and see. Had a wonderful mother/ daughter trip and would do it again. Been in other hotels in area and this was definitely a solid 4 star. The fitness well above average and house keeping did a nice job maintaininig room. Hotel Monaco is an older hotel with modern amenities. ", 
    "Hotel Monaco, is a nice boutique hotel. It was in excellent condition. The staff was pleasant. The room decor was very nice. The window seats were a bonus that was utilized by our two age 16 girls. The shower was a problem though. I don't know if we happened to get a handicap shower, or perhaps all rooms are this way. But the shower floor slopes out, and there only was a shower curtain. The water poured over the shower floor edge causing a large part of the bathroom floor to get soaked, as well as the floor mat and any towels on the floor. The water ran all the way across the room to the bathroom door. It was a pain. The parking was outrageously expensive.", 
    "Great staff and location. Good choice for a weekend getaway.", 
    "Nice smaller hotel on the south side of the river. Restaurant just off the lobby & L station not far away.", 
    "Made reservation for travel for myself and two other colleagues. Made flight and hotel reservation through Expedia two weeks ahead of time. Confirmed both day before travel. Took clients out to happy hour and dinner after work and arrived at hotel only to be told \"Expedia overbooked our hotel.\" First, if you communicate correctly with Expedia, there's no way to \"overbook.\" Next morning, manager basically told me they hope that someone won't show up when that situation happens. (Same manager who still hasn't returned my calls!) Entire city was sold out so they could \"relocate\" us back at the airport that evening. FOR A PRE-PAID, CONFIRMED HOTEL RESERVATION! THEY ALREADY HAD MY MONEY AND STILL GAVE MY ROOMS AWAY! ", 
    "The hotel is central (walking/biking distance) to visiting the Willis Tower, Navy Pier, Magnificent Mile, and lots of restaurants. Our room was spacious and luxurious. I was concerned that being on the third floor we would hear the street noise, but that was not the case. The room was comfortable and clean. The staff friendly and helpful. Our stay here had us wishing we could stay longer. We had breakfast at the attached restaurant and it was delightful. We will plan to stay here on our next visit to Chicago. The hotel does not have a spa, but they do have a spa they work with to offer in-room services.", 
    "Great location, comfy bed. Helpful, pleasant staff.", 
    "My husband and I had a wonderful mini-moon (short honeymoon) at the Hotel Monaco. It was everything we could have imagined and more. We loved the lounging nook that overlooked the river and enjoyed breakfast in bed there. The staff was available for everything and anything. They were so friendly and fast. We look forward to going there everytime we stay over in the city. The location was walking distance to all of the places we wanted to go. ", 
    "I've stayed in the Chicago Monaco before, and it doesn't disappoint. This time I brought my daughter along with me, and she was very impressed. The Decor is elegant, the staff welcoming, and the price is right. I'll go back soon!", 
    "The hotel looks nothing like the pictures. The bathroom was disgusting. The hallways smelled like body odor and mold. I was extremely disappointed. This was supposed to be a special birthday and we ended up overpaying for a regular hotel room with nothing special about it. We will never go back and would not recommend this hotel. ", 
    "The service here was fantastic and the rooms are great. This is a fantastic option for anyone who wants to stay downtown for a reasonable price.", 
    "This is our second time staying at a Kimpton hotel. We stayed at one of their hotels in Boston and absolutely loved it. That is why we chose a Kimpton this time. The Hotel Monaco was fabulous. The rooms were very clean with great beds, great bedding and towels. The trademark bathrobes are a riot. The evening free wine bar is always a treat as is the constantly filled jugs of cold cucumber or lemon water. A very nice touch after a hot day in the sun. But what really makes the hotel special was their staff. Not only were they very professional and knowledgable but they were really genuine in their kindness. They always put in an extra effort to assist whenever they could. Whenever we travel through the states again we will always check to see if their is a Kimpton hotel in the area where we can stay. Thank you hotel Monaco.", 
    "The hotel staff was friendly and courteous. Room was very clean. Good experience.", 
    "I really enjoyed my stay at the Hotel Monaco. The location is great as it is just off Michigan Avenue almost at the start of the magnificent mile where South Michigan Avenue becomes North Michigan Avenue so it is close to both all the attractions in grant park at not that far from the museum campus but also close to the attractions on and around the magnificent mile and not that far from Lincoln park. There is CTA station on pretty much every line within a short walk. The staff were friendly and the wine tasting hour between 5 and 6 pm is a nice bonus if you are in the hotel at the time.", 
    "Our stay in Hotel Monaco (4 days) was very enjoyable. The staff was exceptionally helpful. We had loads of questions for the concierge and staff at the desk. all, from the gentleman managing the door, the concierge, the staff at the desk to those maintaining the rooms, were as patient as could be in listening and answering appropriately and also being helpful with extra info to our queries. There is wine served at 5 p.m. for all and it is quite a nice reception. One of the three rooms for our group was very large, the others were average. All rooms were quite clean were designed artistically. We felt at home and thoroughly enjoyed it. ", 
    "Stayed here on a recent business trip to Chicago. The hotel was nice and clean. Rooms were spacious and the internet was reliable. Tall ceilings and window seats were a surprising luxury. I was able to sit in the padded window seat with my laptop and watch the boats cruise up and down the river. Good restaurants near by, very central to everything in the city. Parking was a bit of a chore. Just be forewarned, it is $56 per night for parking but I think that is to be expected downtown.", 
    "Our family of 4 LOVES this hotel! We visit Chicago fairly often & have tried other hotels in the Loop & GOld Coast area. After years of experimenting, we concluded Hotel Monaco is our best option. The price is certainly not budget-friendly but it is \"reasonable\" for a hotel of this caliber in the Loop. The staff is wonderful, the location is so convenient, the decor is beautiful, & the rooms are fantastic. The size of the rooms is quite impressive for CHicago hotels in this price range.", 
    "Great hotel", 
    "Our room was very nice, and we loved the window seat! The staff was very friendly and helpful. The location of the hotel was perfect! We enjoyed coffee in the morning and the evening wine reception. The bed was very comfortable. We will definitely be back!", 
    "The view from the window on the city is awesome. Especially the the mini bed that is set against the window, it gives a great view. ", 
    "Room was a nice size for a city hotel and included a window seat that you could look out on the river from your room.", 
    "Loved the window seats. Roll aways were lovely fainting couches.", 
    "Great location, not far from restaurants and shops. Great customer service. ", 
    "Very nice hotel, courteous staff, excellent location. Walking distance to the train, Michigan Ave, Millennium Park and other must-see sights. I will look for this hotel on my next stay in Chicago.", 
    "It was my first rip to Chicago and the Hotel Monaco helped make it an amazing trip. The location was perfect. So close to everything I wanted to see, the Bean, the river, the plaza with the Picaso, the Willis tower, and more. They had loaner bikes for a ride along the river. I was able to do yoga Inu room which helped prepare for walking through Chicago. And best of all I got a gold fish for my room :) Oh, and the gym was nice", 
    "The hotel was beautiful and was nicely located among many attractions. We parked our car and took the L or walked to anywhere we wanted. I would highly recommend this because the traffic patterns are crazy. The service was quick and friendly everyone was always willing to answer questions or make suggestions for us. The window seat in the room was incredible and big enough for two people to lay comfortably. I would return 100%", 
    "Convenient check-in and clean rooms with high quality appointments. Great location obviously and the hotel doesn't take this for granted and let service slip down a notch. The front desk was easy to speak with and the bar in the restaurant downstairs was excellent! I ordered an Old Fashioned and it was one of the best I've had. Would stay here again.", 
    "Staff was very friendly. Hotel is beautiful. I loved my stay and I loved the few from my room.", 
    "Great hotel location but room location within hotel makes a big difference. Can hear conversation in next room thru common adjoining doors.", 
    "The hotel overall was unbelievable, from the front desk help to the concierge. We actually picked it off of a Hotels.com recommendation and could not have been more pleased.", 
    "Hotel was great but they put us in a room that destruction/construction of a building across from our window was taking place. it started at 6:00 am on Saturday morning after we had enjoyed a Friday night out. Since I went through a third party they could not adjust my bill.", 
    "Personnel was very nice...room was decorated very nice..wall mirror frame needed a good cleaning it was very dusty...easy access to bay window seat was not good at all..I had to climb on the chase lounge to get up there and down..Not good at all for 2 seniors..River view that was seen on advertisement online wasn't available unless you had a room at the corner of the building. Which I didn't have..Location was great for attending the theater.....", 
    "Quieter than some of the other major streets around that area. Beautiful interior with high end finishes. Staff friendly and attentive.", 
    "The hotel was very nice. I would definitely come back here on my next trip to Chicago. They give free wireless internet after filling out a brief form (name, address, pillow preference, etc.). They welcome pets, although we didn't test this out on this occasion. Also, perhaps most valuable to us on this trip, they are within 3 city blocks from every subway line. The room was considerably larger than other hotels that I have stayed at in Chicago (in the same price range). The view was considerably less impressive than others, though. ", 
    "Very nice and new accommodations. Keurig coffee in the room (on request) was a plus. Concierge was a bit stuffy but rest of the staff was very friendly and helpful. Great location, too.", 
    "Unfortunate experience. The photos looked very promising, but reality was different.", 
    "Very pleasant staff and lovely room with huge window seat overlooking the river. The bathroom was very basic, though. Major drawback was noise from the el train. Also, free wifi should be included!", 
    "The staff was AMAZING. So helpful and thoughtful! Only two nights, but a great stay.", 
    "This was the first time we have stayed at a Kimpton property and we were very impressed! The location was perfect for everything we wanted to do, from the architectural cruise on the Chicago River to a walk to Millenium Park. The rooms were lovely but the best feature was the comfy cushioned window seat with a view of the sparkling river (although we could have done without the huge TRUMP sign on the adjacent skyscraper -- UGLY and unnecessary.). The staff was friendly and accommodating, the concierge was helpful with arranging for tickets, and best of all was the wine social in the lobby from 5-6 pm with free drinks. You can't go wrong with this hotel. Highly recommend the king room with the window seats on one of the higher floors.", 
    "I love Kimpton Hotels and Hotel Monaco did not disappoint! Friendly service, very nice rooms and great location! Within walking distance of many wonderful restaurants and Michigan Avenue shopping, as well as Millennium Park and Willis Tower.", 
    "Loved this place! Great location, staff were excellent and the window seat facing the river and Trump tower was spectacular. Centrally located so easy accessibility to all kinds of sights to see. The rooms were very nice and clean, only one comment in regard to temp control...couldn't Get the air conditioner to quit blowing even when the thermostat was off. Definitely would go back and will be recommending to friends.", 
    "Smaller room, 2star bath room. Bed leaned Nicer options out there trump, Langland, Sheraton towers", 
    "The room was very quiet and nice. The staff were very helpful and friendly. The room was missing soap, paper, pens...all those things that you take for granted. Took a couple of phone calls but did get the items we needed. ", 
    "We thoroughly enjoyed the Monaco. This was the first time our two sons (21 and 17) had been in the city, and the location was perfect. Easy to get to several great meals, visiting the sites we wanted to see (two blocks from Millennium Park), and shopping on Michigan Avenue. The hotel was terrific; great service from the concierge (perfect recommendations on Chicago deep dish pizza), and the room was outstanding with bay windows to views of the Chicago River and downtown vistas. A memorable visit!", 
    "Enjoyed this hotel. I do think they need new mattresses though.", 
    "Overall the trip was wonderful! The staff at hotel monaco could not have been more accomadating. I love the hotel! Everything about it was so beautiful from the entrance up to the room the decor was amazing. The beds were comfortable and so were the robes that were in the room! I will be going back to hotel monaco", 
    "I have stayed at many Kimpton properties and this is one of my favorites. The staff has been consistently great -- friendly, helpful. Location is the best for anyone wanting to be close to the river, Millennium Park and other signature Chicago sights and experiences. ", 
    "Nice few days at a central clean hotel. Good value for money and the window seats are a unique aspect of the rooms. ", 
    "Hotel Monaco was a major part of the Chicago town experience. It helped make Chicago very enjoyable. I would return again. I have never rated a hotel all fives. This one deserved it. I cannot think of a negative experience, except parking is challenging, but it is like that everywhere in Chicago major.", 
    "This is my second time there, first time was for business. This time I took the wife and kids there for a week on vacation. We got a river view room And requested a high floor room so the kids would enjoy the view. They gave us the 9th floor, the view was awesome an the kids loved the window beds. Also the weekday daytime doorman is great. So nice , helpful an great to deal with everytime I talked to him. Love this place and can't wait to go back.", 
    "The location is perfect. We had a river view and we were in walking distance of just about everything. If we couldn't walk, we took the train which we were 2 blocks from. The room and staff were great! Really, not one complaint.", 
    "My wife and I decided to get away for the 4th of July weekend, we found Hotel Monoco and loved it. THe location was great for walking to amenities, the hotel was quirky cool, the wine reception was great; teh only down side was teh $56/night parking with no other options in sight. ", 
    "Great location, awesome staff, excellent room! Highly recommend river view rooms with day bed views of the city. ", 
    "A Great urban start to our family vacation . Liked how close it was to our architecture boat tour and the navy pier.", 
    "I was extremely impressed with my stay at The Hotel Monaco. The room more than met my expectations. The bed was huge, and the view on to the river would be very difficult to beat.", 
    "Had a fabulous experience. Offered an upgrade on arrival to a suite, complete with a deep soaking jetted tub. Prompt and superb room service; distinctive menu, even better wine list. Within walking distance of theater we wanted to visit and other attractions, but who wanted to leave! Definitely going back!", 
    "The size of the room was wonderful, very nicely decorated, great attention to detail!", 
    "Very comfortable and tons of amenities. Bike rentals in the lobby!", 
    "I wanted a less corporate feel for a business trip and got it here. Rooms are clean, the location is fantastic, and there's a wine reception each night. What more could you ask for?", 
    "One of the best beds I have ever slept on. The staff were amazing and accommodating. The hotel and the room are beautiful and unique. I will definitely be staying here again. The hotel is in close proximity to many downtown attractions and great restaurants. Highly recommended. ", 
    "The Hotel Monaco is in a great location if this is your first visit to Chicago because it is within walking distance of many Chicago highlights and sights that first time visitors want to see. The staff was more than friendly and bent over backward to make certain our stay was pleasant and stress free! Would definitely stay there again!", 
    "We had a very enjoyable first time visit to Chicago. We will return and probably stay at this same hotel. The staff were extremely helpful with making reservations at restaurants and tourist sites. Free WiFi and the use of a computer was very helpful. Front desk volunteered to run off our boarding passes.", 
    "Great experience from check in and requesting an extra blanket to coffee and a great bell stand for finding me a cab", 
    "My wife and I stayed a week. Except for the doorman who gave us wrong directions to a popular restaurant, the stay was just about flawless. Even the restaurant, which we thought we would avoid when we arrived, proved to be very satisfactory one night when it was raining too hard to go anywhere else. The doorman's error cost us two unnecessary cab fares and wasted valuable vacation time But he apologized and no real harm was done So we recommend the hotel very highly, but in the future we will always prefer Google Maps over the advice of a doorman.", 
    "everything at the hotel was excellent, all hotel staff were very friendly", 
    "Too much street noise in room 206. Bad view No liner in ice bucket", 
    "We had a wonderful stay at the Monaco. Room was very big and very comfortable, staff was friendly, elevators were fast. On thing, we were facing the parking garage and could hear the train in the distance. I actually liked hearing the sound of the train but if you want quiet, ask to be on the other side of the hotel.", 
    "My family and I enjoyed our stay at the Hotel Monaco. We had requested a large room and they were true to their word. The view was a brick wall but they did ask what kind of room we wanted ahead to time and we opted for the larger room than a view. Check in was a breeze. The room was very clean and spacious but the make-up mirror was falling off the wall, the sheet had a hole in it and the wooden soap dish has large gouges in it. Not a big deal but these are noticable things that can be corrected. The restuarant in the hotel was very good and the service was fairly attentive. Location was right in the Loop and close to many of the attractions. We were able to walk to Michigan Ave. and Navy Pier. I would go back to this hotel as the positives outweigh any negatives.", 
    "Excellent location, close to Loop, Millenium Park, river. L nearby could be heard more loudly than ideal but not a huge problem. There was a very loud wedding party on our floor with a piglet on a leash \"incident\" which caused quite a rucus one night. There seemed to be cleanup happening after the party which lasted into the wee hours of the morning (2-3am) which kept us awake that night. It sounded like they were throwing furniture around in there. Otherwise, w had a nice stay. Our friends stayed at the Fairmont Millenium for about the same rate and that was a much more luxurious hotel.", 
    "An upgrade for a 'river view room' was a bit deceptive. If you are above the 5th floor, you may see a sliver during day time, but through VERY dirty windows. When we spent the extra money for the room and were placed on the 3rd floor with a mostly neighboring building view, a comment was made. The hotel staff quickly offered us a different floor and made things better. If you want a river view, this is probably not the hotel for you. The hotel itself was clean. The staff was fabulous.", 
    "Great views, staff, walking distance to everything! Concierge Ryan was amazing and the staff was helpful in every way. I would just advise not bringing a car. $56 a night to park and most everything is walking distance and you can use Uber instead of stinky Cabs! Or use the hotel or city's rental bikes! The staff was so excited about our getting married as well and treated us so special! Oh, and free wine from six to seven pm!", 
    "why I booked this hotel just because I love the bay window and the view in the photo. But it is really not like the photo. I booked the regular king bed room with the price more than $200. There is no soft-decorated bay window in my room and in front of our window there is a old in construct building, about 20 feet? no river view unless you would like pay 100 bucks more to switch to suit or high level room. But if you just try to find somewhere with convenient transportation and large bed, it should be a good option. Only take 5 minutes walk to the \"cloud gate\" :)", 
    "A nice place near downtown for a reasonable rate. The connected restaurant was good and breakfast was served faster than anyplace I'd been and I had the check before I finished. It was like they knew you didn't have time to spend eating and needed to be on your way. A good place for business travelers and I'll stay there again.", 
    "We picked this hotel because of the window seats! It was really nice. The staff was so very helpful and kind in every way. You are right on the Chicago River and an easy walk to the Magnificent Mile and Millenium Park and Navy Pier. Would highly recommend this hotel.", 
    "Great location, great room, great staff! Would definitely stay at Hotel Monaco again in the future.", 
    "Nice stay, a little noisy with the construction next door. Room was clean, no hair conditioner in the room, iron didn't work well. Bed was nice and comfy, room served it purpose, I would come back.", 
    "I travel quite often and I must say I was impressed by the quality of service at the Hotel Monaco. Nothing was difficult for the concierge or the reception people. From the moment we arrived we felt we were welcome. The hotel style is not according to my preference but that is a different story. I find their policy of taking care of guests excellent and I wish to thank them for our comfortable stay at their hotel.", 
    "After traveling with our dog at many different hotel chains, I was so glad to have found a chain that really enjoys that your dog is there and treats them like a guest. We enjoyed our room and the wine hour and the great restaurants in walking distance.", 
    "Overall great place to stay! There was construction on the building right next to our room so, even on Saturday morning of Memorial weekend we were awakened by the noise. Other than that - great spot!!", 
    "The hotel was in a great location, with great service, and at a great price as well. The staff was incredibly friendly and helpful from the moment we arrived to when we left. I will be staying again.", 
    "We really enjoyed our stay. We spent hours in the window seat people watching. The hotel is in a great location within walking distance of the beach and navy pier. You should be aware that there is an additional parking fee just north of $50. A night.", 
    "Great Boutique Hotel..", 
    "This hotel group use to be fantastic, but simply have fallen behind. Way overpriced, dated interiors, room amenities are stale and the tiger print robes laughable. There are so many hotels in Chicago that blow this place away. Check out the Peninsula and spend a little more. That hotel blows this place away! Kimpton was always known for great reataurabt properties on site. The restaurant attached to this hotel was terrible. Lighting in the restaurant appeared to be set at full bright with no Manager in site.", 
    "good overall based on location comfort & amenities. Charging for internet seems like a stone age practice, lobby very comfy but small, attached restaurant/bar is a quaint place. Details like woodwork caulking, paint, carpet spots etc. need attention.", 
    "Enjoyed it very much and would have stayed Friday and Saturday but the rates were too high.", 
    "Ok for the view, quiet room. Very clean'..'............", 
    "We will definitely be back for another weekend get away. It was in walking distance to so many places. Staff were friendly. Rooms were nice and clean.", 
    "This was our 2nd stay at the Monaco and I loved this hotel both times. The hotel is clean and the staff wonderful. The theatre and great restaurants are within walking distance. I will definitely stay here again.", 
    "Very good...in The Loop....lots of big hotels but we prefer boutique ones like this.", 
    "Had a great time in Chicago. Hotel was very comfortable and close to all downtown activities.", 
    "Great location--close to Michigan Avenue, Art Institute and shopping. The rooms are comfortable, decor is lovely. The wine reception every night is the best. The concierge, Ryan suggested excellent restaurants and staff is so helpful. Kimpton Hotels are our favorite and our first choice in every city they serve.", 
    "This is really good hotel with nice view of river and bridges. Of course, it makes me feel comfortable and sleep very well. I am so satisfied so much I've ever felt.", 
    "Francis at the front desk was such a delight after a 14 hr flight from Tahiti. Ryan was all smiles as were the rest of the staff. My life should always be a window seat at the Monaco. Sweat water cafe and Ellen our waitress rocked. A happy summer to you all. Joey", 
    "All was wonderful except for what is considered the usual comfort component in a room....no comfy upholstered chair with a reading lamp in the room, perhaps because of the very wonderful window seats which are deep and pillowed but at nite lack any lighting by which to sit and read or engage in hobby of choice...a wall lite in the window seating would be a true plus. The window seating also requires that individual be either 7 foot tall or rather athletic...no step stool provided and they are very high off the floor! Otherwise....we continue to return!", 
    "I was visiting Chicago to attend two different work conferences, both downtown but in opposite directions. The location of Hotel Monaco was great. It was close enough to everything downtown that I could walk to both my work conferences as well as to shopping (Macy's, etc.) and the theater district. There were plenty of restaurants (such as Catch Thirty Five) within walking distance as well. The room was clean and spacious. I was able to check in early. The bed was very comfortable. It felt like a very fun, trendy hotel. The staff were all extremely friendly and helped me find cabs, get directions, etc. The best part was a 12:00pm checkout time. I will definitely stay at this hotel (or any Kimpton hotel) again.", 
    "It was nice and close to my conference venue as well as the other sights.", 
    "Hotel room was roomy. Staff was very friendly. Thought room service was average at best. lacked choices and no menu in room. had to call for one.", 
    "My sisters and I had such an awesome stay. The staff was friendly and helpful. The rooms were spacious and clean. The location was central to everything in Chicago. I will definitely stay there again.", 
    "The location, the gorgeous rooms, the staff, the wine reception and coffee bar made this a perfect hotel. I particularly enjoyed waking up and sitting in the cozy window seats overlooking Chicago. A great memory.", 
    "I would like to say, as a person that travels alot, that my stay was at the Hotel Monaco was great. I prefer to stay at Kimpton Hotels when I have a chance and the Hotel Monaco in Chicago was wonderful. Staff very accommodating and pleasant. Amenities were many. Would love to come back for a stay when I am in Chicago.", 
    "I couldn't have asked for better service, nicer people or a nicer place to stay! My overall experience with Chicago's Hotel Monoco was absolutely perfect in every way!!", 
    "Hotel was great. Centrally located and doorman Michael was awesome. Would highly recommend."

    "Overall hotel was fine but room was small and bathroom small with an awkward layout.", 
    "Great Location, walkable from Union Station and yet only blocks from the night life. The staff was friendly. The walls are a little thin, heard a lot of hall activity but all in all worth the price we paid!", 
    "Great hotel, it was under construction remodel. but that is what I like about this hotel chain, they always make improvements to their hotels. Staff was very professional and polite. ", 
    "This hotel was great! All the staff was friendly and so helpful!! The room was very tiny but it was very nice. The toilet did flood and it may have been due to all the construction since when we called the staff to fix it, it sounded like it was something that had been happening quite a bit. They did fix it right away so it wasnt a bad experience. Over all I really liked this hotel. ", 
    "Great hotel if you're looking for a place in the theatre district! The riverfront and lakefront are a fairly short walk. My king room was a tad on the small side, but I was traveling alone so it wasn't a big deal. ", 
    "I was extremely disappointed with my stay at Hotel Allegro. All the reviews I read were completed wrong. The best part about my stay was the fact that there was a Starbucks in the lobby. Otherwise, everything sucked. The room was the size of a shoe box. The closet and bathroom were even smaller. There was no place to get ready in the bathroom because there was absolutely not space to stand between the toilet bowl, tub and sink counter. Our drain was clogged in our bathtub and the tv didn't work properly. Not to mention, the electrician who came to fix our television said, \"Oh they must have just thrown this room together because it wasn't even a room as of recently.\" The hotel staff did nothing to make our stay more enjoyable. I complained twice and they could only offer me a room upgrade with the same size bathroom for $60 more dollars a night. There was also a very funky smell. The hotel tried to squeeze way too many rooms on one floor and the result was an extremely uncomfortable closet to live in for the weekend. We were thoroughly disappointed and we will never go back. ", 
    "The hotel is extremely clean. The rooms are a little small. The staff are very friendly and helpful. I would stay here again. Close to shopping, for sightseeing and is located in Chicago's theater district. Excellent hotel. ", 
    "We had a room 622 that was essentially in the elevator lobby. (Apparently all of the floors have this issue- ) they moved us the next night but didn't have any more rooms to move us to the first night. We got 808 and was very quite. Hotel getting a check-in reception area remodel so this review is not based on the temporary check in area. Art Deco in rooms very nice although the rooms are small. I had to shimmy around my husband to get to the bathroom. King sized bed plus a small table. Bath room - if sitting on toilet can start water in the shower and in the sink from same sitting position. Very clean. Location excellent and walked everywhere. Lunch places close by only open M-F. When booked through Expedia you can't get Kimpton reward \"Karma\" points and you get labeled \"pre-pay\" so it's possible that's why we got the rooms we did. Price was right and bed was exceptionally comfortable. Would stay there again but bring earplugs just in case. ", 
    "great location excellent location close to trains and near tons of restaurants ", 
    "Room and bathroom were very small. Not large enough for more than one person. Double bed instead of King bed. Decor recently updated but is very unattractive. Parking is valet only for $59 per night. Staff was great. Location of hotel is very good. Only stayed for one night which was long enough because of room size", 
    "The staff was extremely friendly and quick with any requests. The coffee and wine service provided by the hotel makes your visit even more pleasant. ", 
    "Staff was very pleasant and helpful with accurate directions to the areas I was interested in going.", 
    "This place will be super after the ongoing renovation is complete. For now, it's solid, but the rooms are small and a bit dark. I could have used more elbow room to work, and in the bathroom. The location is outstanding- walking distance to all main business centers, tourist attractions and theaters. Great restaurants and bars all around.", 
    "Spent theree days in Chicago. Arrived five hours late due to snow, feeling a bit frazzled. The staff were so welcoming and reassuring - 'would you like a glass of wine?' Room large and comfortable, very clean and well looked after. Same with bathroom Teas/coffees were available in the foyer every morning and a wine hour between 5 & 6. Nice to meet other guests and pass the time with them ", 
    "Staff were helpful, knowledgeable about the city and places to go. The room could have been a little larger. There was a wet room which I personally did not like as the whole bathroom seemed to get flooded and it took a while for the water to drain away. The situation of the hotel was ideal for us as it was convenient for Magnificent Mile and Theatre District. My two daughters ran in the Shamrock Shuffle 8K race and the hotel was on the route so I had a great vantage point right outside the hotel. Only one downside was that the hotel was being renovated and access to some areas was not possible. We hadn't been told about this beforehand.", 
    "Hotel is every nice. It was under construction during my stay. It did not affect my room or comfort. ", 
    "The staff was above and beyond accommodating and friendly! The room was gorgeous and it was smack in the middle of everything. I would definitely stay there again!!", 
    "We didn't know that the hotel was undergoing renovation so things were a little disorganized. We were put in an elevator shaft room initially, and the inroom fridge was unplugged,but the kind support staff put us in a nicer room once we asked - even though it was close to 1 am. ", 
    "Only stayed for two nights so this was a great option. The room was spacious and clean. I like the amenities offered. My only gripe was waking up to construction noise on a Saturday, but read the reviews ahead of time about this possibility and there was a nice note from the hotel manager about it in the room upon entering.", 
    "Hotel is currently undergoing a remodel. It's fully functional and there was no problems with noise, dust, etc. The staff is great! Very prompt and helpful. We were on the 14th floor and the area has been updated. The room was nice an big but we would have liked to have some drawers for unpacking. There were two very small drawers in the entertainment center. It also contained a room safe and a snack bar (we think. we never had the key to open it). The bathroom is very small and there really is no 'flat space' to use for cosmetics, shaving gear, etc. The new decor, while very new and clean, is not our style. It's rather dark and, to me, had a 1960's vibe. The location is great for the theater district, right next to the Cadalac Theater. There are a few nearby restaurants but most of the landmark places are a mile or so away. I'm sure you'll be happy if you stay here.", 
    "I love this hotel chain for just about every reason...from the rooms, to the people, to the networking and wine events, they are pet friend and very social and ecologically conscious and very Philanthropic. ", 
    "I can't wait to go back!! I went to get away and relax and this hotel did not disappoint. One of my favorite things was that every room had a yoga mat. There was also a yoga channel. In the morning I enjoyed organic tea in the lobby. This hotel was right up my alley!", 
    "very good location but currently work in progress that prevent breakfast for instance.", 
    "Comfortable, quiet and clean. Hotel staff were friendly and helpful. Wine time in the lobby was a fantastic touch. ", 
    "Bed reasonably comfortable great location for what we wanted to do.", 
    "Nice place. Funky as expected. Extremely small but efficient bathroom.", 
    "The rooms were small but had all that you needed. The staff was nothing short of awesome - friendly, courteous and very helpful. For that alone, I would come back even though the hotel had minor inconveniences with the construction for the remodeling. Once that is complete, I am sure it would be excellent.", 
    "Room was small but served its purpose. Overall a nice place to stay", 
    "needed a place to crash so as not to drive home after the night out, at the price we paid, the Allegro filled the bill. ", 
    "We went to Chicago for the 1st time ever this weekend and you better believe we WILL be back! This hotel is fit for a true Chicago experience!", 
    "Excellent LOCATION Nice educated staff Room impeccable ", 
    "Staff was not very helpful. Front desk staff promised to call us when our room was ready and never did. We left our bags with the bell captain and were disappointed that they were not delivered to our room when it was finally ready. The front desk referred us to a restaurant that we walked too only to discover that it was not open on Saturdays. They are doing some remodeling and would like to see the completed project. ", 
    "Have to admit I was a bit disappointed with Allegro, having had fantastic stays at other Kimpton hotels. Room was very small. Beyond the bed, there was no other furniture to lounge on. Bathroom was beyond tiny. Everything was clean, but just not the experience I was looking for when I book a Kimpton hotel.", 
    "The hotel staff was very friendly and helpful, but the hotel itself had NO amenities...no soda machines, no coffee (other than a few hours in the morning, no snacks, nothing! The staff directed us to a local 7-11 around the corner. Also, would not recommend staying here on the weekend as the hotel is located in the Financial area of town and EVERYTHING around it (except the 7-11, thank goodness) closes by 10:00pm.", 
    "This was a nice hotel to stay in and overall I give it a thumbs up", 
    "I wish I had known about the extent of the renovations going on before I booked at the Allegro. I have stayed there several times before and liked the ambiance. This time, the lobby was inaccessible, the evening wine reception was in a little nook on the ground floor, and the room itself seemed sterile and cold. (I don't know if the room had been recently renovated or not.) The only bright spot was the employees. All were very helpful and very friendly. I'm glad I was just there overnight.", 
    "Great location for business meeting, walk to office", 
    "Very nice, typical Kimpton--good service, fun part of town (next to a theater). It's under renovation, but even that made little difference.", 
    "Last minute needed a hotel because of flight delay. The place will be nice when construction is done. Staff were great.", 
    "Will come back again.", 
    "This hotel is old. I thought we had a King bed but it ended up being a double. The room is small and so is the bathroom. There are no vending machines so when we got back to the hotel at 10pm we could not get anything to drink - water, pop etc. The restaurant across the street was closed. Don't look for any amenities here.", 
    "The hotel is in a sleepy part of the Loop at night/ weekends. Gym was under construction so had to walk 6 blocks to la fitness. Room is small and awkward bathroom barn doors make getting ready an extra challenge. Hotel just feels old and in need of some spunk.", 
    "Nice interior and friendly environment. The hotel keeps your room clean and neat everyday.", 
    "Disappointed that the gym was closed for renovations, since the LT fitness was 5 blocks away (and it was cold!). Hopefully the renovated gym will be worth it. Also, the adjacent restaurant was closed on Mondays, and the one downstairs has disappeared, leaving the hotel with no adjoining restaurant on Mondays, which is odd. All in all, still a good hotel, but this particular visit was a bit disappointing.", 
    "Great place and fantastic staff. Somewhat like a boutique hotel but very nice.", 
    "Pleasant and comfortable. Staff always eager to help.", 
    "Stayed with my husband for 6 nights during New Year holidays. I liked the hotel. Pros are: location, hotel and room design, gym and 5 o'clock free alcohol drinks in the lobby. Cons: the room was a little too small although very cozy, on the first of Jan one could wait for an elevator for like 10 minutes - way too busy when the hotel is fully booked. In general the stay was very nice. The location of the hotel is just great - very convenient, close to everything in the Loop. Their vallet parking is overpriced and makes no sense to use, there are at least 3 self-parking facilities around with a price 30% less.", 
    "Lovely hotel. Starbucks in the foyer.", 
    "Nice hotel, good location, friendly staff. Like the raid the mini bar feature", 
    "Met expectations. I would stay there again.", 
    "We went to Chicago for a night to go to the opera and the Allegro was very convenient for that. Very nice....hip place. I just wish our room hadn't been right next to the EL train....I mean right over it!!", 
    "Overall, it was fine. The elevators are very slow and inadequate for the building. We spent a lot of time waiting on them. In addition, the room was too small and a bit too warm.", 
    "Hotel was very clean and employees were very nice.I would recommend this hotel", 
    "It was a good room we had a great time downtown", 
    "nice, clean, quiet. Me, my husband and our dog enjoyed the stay. We will be back", 
    "Great atmosphere", 
    "I loved the architecture and style of this gorgeous hotel! It had a very relaxing, yet chic, vibe (especially during their daily complimentary wine tasting). Sure, the sophisticated amosphere really did blow me away, but my positive rating isn't based solely on looks. The staff was very accommodating, friendly, and full of restaurant recommendations. Everything I noticed seemed clean and I'm working order. In general the hotel is in a great location. It's by several CTA train stops and cabs are plentiful given it's in theatre district. My only complaints are that the walls were a bit too thin (we had noisy neighbors, if you know what I mean) and that the queen size bedroom was a bit small, but for it's relatively low price I would say that what the rest of the hotel had to offer made it worth it.", 
    "Jean Luc is hot", 
    "One of the best hotels in Chicago. The people were wonderful and very helpful", 
    "Nice place to stay. Good location. Clean, organized and provided good service.", 
    "The hotel staff was fantastic. Probably some of the nicest I've ever come across. The hotel had a \"hangover station\" and offered free cold pizza and coffee in the morning in celebration of New Years Eve. The hotel lobby was also very nice and cozy. The room was a bit small, but it had a nice T.V. and comfortable bed. The biggest downside came mostly from the fact that it was New Years Eve. There was a party down the hall with a very large number of people that eventually was broken up. Also, the couple staying in the room next to ours was really, REALLY enjoying their stay. Though, I think the female must have stubbed her toes quite a few times because there was a lot of thumping and screaming.", 
    "Security couldn't take care of a noisy person for 2 and half hours at 3 am in the morning.", 
    "Had a really good time the hotel staff were really nice people and they have a lot of complimentary items if you forget them at home such as a flat iron! No charge to you. Loved my stay will definitely go back ", 
    "The morning cold pizza was a great idea for New Year Day. ", 
    "I love it", 
    "We traveled with a 4 year old and this hotel was perfect. Hot chocolate bar at 2 pm and space for all 3 of us in the room. Excellent customer service, beautiful lobby. We love Kimpton hotels.", 
    "My 2 daughters and I enjoyed our stay at Hotel Allegro for the following reasons: All staff that we had contact with were very professional. The location was ideal for our plans of shopping and sightseeing. The beds were very comfortable. The lobby area had a wonderful smell like a floral shop as you came off the elevator.", 
    "I stay here often when in Chicago. As always, a good experience.", 
    "We love staying here. So close to parking. So close to the theatre. So close to shopping. The staff is always prompt and polite. Great place to stay.", 
    "Stayed at the Allegro this past long weekend. Took a couple of tries to get the room layout we liked but the front desk staff was very patient and accommodating. We were on the 14th floor overlooking Randolph and were never bothered by train noise or any other noise for that matter. The room was very clean and functional. Totally served our needs for an empty-nesters getaway. We would definitely stay here again", 
    "Great location. Nice Staff that are very responsive. No room service as they do not have restaurant facilities. You have to ask for a coffee server for the room. However, it is complimentary and they brought me a Kurig with all the add-ons. Hotel is old, but has been modernized into a boutique hotel.", 
    "Met a friend here to attend a Christmas party without having to drive home. The room was spotless, good use of a smaller space, exceptionally quiet for being in the heart of Chicago. Got a great price for a Saturday night. Would certainly come again.", 
    "I appreciated the complimentary wine bar but would have been much happier with free internet. And the parking charges took the joy out of the deal I got on the room. On the positive side, the staff was amazingly friendly and helpful. And the location was awesome!", 
    "We stay at the Kimpton Hotels in Chicago a few times a year--love the holiday atmosphere and the 312 Restaurant!", 
    "It was nice. Room a little small", 
    "Like all Kimpton properties, this one is top shelf. Great location, beautiful room, friendly staff and a reasonable price.", 
    "I'm seriously picky about cleanliness of bathtub. Soap film on bottom is the reason I docked it a point. Nothing gross or yucky in the room.", 
    "Cozy, trendy. Great hospitality!", 
    "Very straight forward, regular hotel stay. Decor was interesting, didn't match the old \"historic\" feel I was wanting to see. But resonably priced and bice location.", 
    "Great location and price for a quick get away to Chicago. The room is a bit small, as is the bathroom, but we didn't spend much time there anyway. Comfortable bed", 
    "This hotel is in a perfect location. Friendly staff and clean rooms. Would stay here again.", 
    "This hotel is within walking distance from the train station, Macy's on State, the Christkindlmarket, and Michigan Avenue. The service was prompt and we enjoyed the festive wine social hour, and the rooms were clean but small. Great place and would stay there again.", 
    "I had a great stay with the staff ensuring all was well looked after. I was pleasantly surprised that my room was available for early checkin when I arrived downtown. Very quick access to the L and all the shopping on State St.", 
    "Very cool hotel in the theatre district of Chicago. The rooms are slightly smaller than usual, however given the hotel being older this is to be excepted. The lobby and common areas of the hotel are decorated with a modern yet classic look. I would recommend this hotel to anyone looking for a deal in Chicago.", 
    "This hotel is a block away from the train station. We took the train from the airport. $6 on Friday and $3 to return on Sunday. The hotel was in the older theatre section of town but it was quaint. Clean and friendly. Yes the rooms were a little small, but we were barely there. We walked and walked the town. The room were on the small side but that is what a older building would be. It was clean and comfy. Staff at front desk were very helpful and enjoying the happy hour at 5 was a nice touch. We could easily walk to State street where Macy's and other \"normal stores were. And yet we were only blocks away from crossing the river to the fancy shopping side. We also had breakfast at the hotel restaurant. Extremely good about 15 each but a nice meal. We also did the Starbucks too which was on the ground floor. This hotel allowed dogs in , but it did not smell like \"dog\".", 
    "A centrally located reasonably priced hotel. good value overall. Service at the restaurant was poor- took 12 minutes to be seated for breakfast ( with 4 parties waiting) while the hostess what chatting with some waiters in the background. Not the fault of the hotel though. One bad apple. ", 
    "Excelente todo muy bien...", 
    "I would definitely book again here when coming to Chicago. Great service, great beds, daily complimentary coffee and wine, fast WiFi, fast elevators, comfortable lobby, incredible location, good TV menu, hot water, room and aisles not cold at all even though outside was 20's and not as expensive as others in the same area.",

    "It is a good hotel but I wanted to have a coffee machine in the room. Although there is a cafe next to the hotel and the lobby has welcome drinks in the evening, I would still want a in-room coffee or tea service. I did not also feel that receptionists are warm welcoming guests. ", 
    "Great hotel in a central location. Housekeeping staff were excellent and worked to a high standard. The reception staff were very helpful and made you feel welcome and part of the family. Thoroughly enjoyed the hospitality event every evening. The room itself was clean and comfortable, slept like babies in the bed. Don't let the fact that it is near the EL put you off. The views from the 14th floor where we were are amazing.", 
    "This is a very nice hotel with a nice price and good location close to theaters, restaurants and shopping. The lovely lobby is a perfect place to enjoy the complimentary coffee or tea in the morning. ", 
    "Our visit to the Hotel Allegro was just one overnight. We had tickets to a play at the theater was right next door so the location of the hotel was very convnient. The room was small, so there was a sense of claustrophobia at times. But the public spaces on the main level were accessible and that allowed us to go down to that level and we were able to comfortably read our story book in front of a cozie fireplace. In a way, this gave me a sense of being at leisurely bed and breakfast rather than a fancy downtown hotel, which one might think would be cold and snooty. The lobby was beautifully decorated for the holidays. Each staff member we encountered was very polite and professional while still giving us very personal attention. Being located in the Loop, I thought we might experience traffic sounds throughout the stay, but that was not the case. You wouldn't even know that one of the busiest streets in the city was just floors below. The Hotel Allegro is a pricey hotel, as I said the room was small ... but for cleanliness, location, personal service and attention, and overall experience it was worth it.", 
    "First, this is in the Loop and the theater district, so if you don't care for that you are just odd :) Seriously, since the Burnham has become so expensive, I've enjoyed calling the Allegro my Chicago home. Kimpton knows hospitality. However, if it were poorly run or had serious safety risks, you'd never know because hotels dot you know rejects reviews like that without ever wanting to discuss it with you. So the Capt.Obvious campaign is a fantasy.", 
    "Great location, quiet room on south side of hotel, very comfortable. Room could use a comfortable lounge chair so sitting on the bed is not only place to read etc. could use a robe hook on bathroom door and music in common areas could be toned down a bit. All in all we would stay here again for sure!", 
    "We hadn't stayed at the Allegro for a while, so we were excited to return. First, the good parts: big television, stocked mini bar, location close to the opera and theaters, & accommodation for one person. Upsetting: only one chair in the room, tiny bathroom with little counter space, no coffee maker, room renovation turned from quirky cool to sterile silver and white resulting in diminished charm, and no room service despite the great 312 Restaurant on site. We would think twice about staying here again.", 
    "Hotel is in an excellent area, close to all the main attractions. The room and view was pretty average considering the cost of the stay. Saying that we were not in the hotel much so it worked out really great for us exploring the city. The free wine and beers each day at 5 was a hit after a long day walking around :)", 
    "Great Spot, Amenities and Staff. Business Trip to Chicago and this location was recommended. Great choice!", 
    "Hotel was very good. Everything you need - Starbucks attached to the lobby so you can get your morning drink without going outside; nice lounging lobby; room was nicely decorated - Kimpton look however bathroom was tiny.", 
    "Great hotel in a fantastic location. It's an easy walk to theatres and shopping. Millenium Park is just six blocks away. You also have the train station right across the street. It's right next door to a wonderful restaurant, 312! I'm definitely staying there again. ", 
    "Unfortunate not to have a nice bar or restaurant available, 312 restaurant was closed for private party and had strange hours when open. Great location for downtown. Nice to have Starbucks connected. Nice to have comp coffee - tea bar in the morning & 5pm wine hour. ", 
    "We came for our anniversary. I loved the atmosphere here. Small rooms, but we were not in there enough for it to bother me. Very close to a lot of things ", 
    "Checked in Thursday evening. The woman checked us in wasnt very warm and friendly. She barely made eye contact and was a bit condescending when I asked about the Karma rewards program. However, the guy that was checking in the couple right next to us was very friendly, jovial, welcoming. We wished he checked us in! Once we got inside the room, it was a bit of a shock that it was pretty small, although we read that from other reviewers. Its manageable, but given the location and age of the building, its expected that the rooms will be on the smaller size. The location of the hotel is wonderful. Its in the theatre district, millenium park, the bean, the christmas market are all in walking distance. There are no late night bars or food options which a bit of a problem when we got hungry at night. I love the wine and beer hour from 5-6pm. They were not skimpy on that and the staff was great. There was a small problem with the mini bar. We asked for it to be locked, which was locked when we checked in. On the 2nd day after housekeeping, it was unlocked. I called down and informed them we did not have a key and did not unlock it, and would not be paying for anything that was missing. They locked it the next day. Upon checkout, we were charged for two items but they quickly took it off when I Reminded them of the conversation. Overall my stay was great. I would definitely return to this hotel.", 
    "Allegro was my target hotel, as I was going to a concert at the theatre in the same block. Small room right off elevator and across from housekeeping access (staff was very noisy). However, room was clean and nicely appointed (I would expect nothing less from the Kimpton brand.) Price was totally out of line with the room, but it (sadly) made sense when I learned there was a wedding party in the house and it was also a Bears home game (vs. the Vikings). That said, the convenience factor (to theatre, shopping on State St., Millenium Park, etc.)and the chance to get away if only for a brief time trumped all!", 
    "The hotel is in a great neighborhood, great service, and great rooms!front desk was very helpful with good suggestions on activities. In the heart of the theatre district. We called the desk at 2am and got prompt service. Beautiful lobby with great coffee service and wine social(didn't partake in the wine).I would stay here again!", 
    "Near theaters, dramatic lobby. Free wine and beer from 5-6pm, coffee served in morning, but no room service. Staff was very accommodating. My suite was large.", 
    "Super slow checkin. Small room. But otherwise a nice place. I stay at Kimptons fairly regularly that have much better service.", 
    "Conceirge was great before and after we arrived. The Loop trains stations only a block or 2 away, easy to walk to Mag Mile and to get to Stadiums. Room small but had everything we needed and the hotel is an eclectic mix of colours and styles, very well put together. Loved the 5-6 pm happy hour drinks. Recommend staying here", 
    "Very nice hotel. Room small (Euro-sized) but very clean, comfortable and well appointed.", 
    "Loved the social hour with complimentary beer and wine. Very casual atmosphere. i enjoyed my stay immensely! I had Ravioli in the restaurant that was better than any I've had anywhere else!!!!! The Front Desk staff went well beyond anything I expected. Very nice hotel!", 
    "Went to Chicago for a Bob Dylan concert at the Cadillac Palace. This hotel was right next door to the theater. Clean rooms and an excellent staff. ", 
    "Good location but small room with noisy aircon and no opening window. Allocated room on floor booked for election night party so suffered a disturbed night. Mentioned at checkout but obviously, the election business was much more valuable than our Expedia booking. Both myself and my wife suffered itching and raised lumps overnight (not before or after our stay) and we wondered if perhaps we may not have been the only occupants of the bed.", 
    "Centrally located, lovely hotel. Would definitely stay here again.", 
    "Nice hotel. Great location for walking to most attractions. Friendly staff. ", 
    "Good central location. Everything was fine apart from the lack of simple to acceess free wifi. The hotel required payment for access or completion of a registration page. None of this is necessary in 2014. Happily the Starbucks next door is free access / no password. Simple! - as it should be", 
    "Nice redo but still is a stretch to call it a \"boutique hotel\". New paint and some wall paper does not boutique make. But- comfy bed and quiet rooms. Nice lobby.", 
    "The hotel rooms are dated. Kind of small.The bed had seen better days. The wallpaper was peeling in the room. The only good thing about this hotel is the location. Also just to note there is no free Wi-Fi in the rooms. You have to sign up for kimpton rewards in order to get free Wi-Fi.", 
    "Centrally located, clean, quiet (inspite of the thin walls...). Overall, very good!", 
    "This use to be a fun hotel in a great location. Well, location is still good but the hotel is showing age. They are soon to undergo a big renovation--and it sounds like this is becoming more of a corporate/event hotel. If that's your thing, certainly check it out--but if you like fun boutique spots, go elswhere!", 
    "Nice and comfortable room, good price, wine and beer hour at 5 PM a nice touch! Close to everything.", 
    "Overall a good hotel. The staff was nice. The room was small. The mattress wasn' t the best, but not horrible. At least it was king-size. The hotel is in the theater district and 4 blocks from thw Lyric Opera. An 'L' stop is less than 2 blocks away. I would stay there again and recommend it to others.", 
    "Hotel was nice but no room service available.", 
    "Disappointing. The hotel special marketing staff never returned the call to extend the wedding group rate as they told the wedding couple they would. Tired of waiting, we booked the room thru Expedia for the same rate. The \"best view\" room overlooked a parking lot, and the closet was too narrow to hang up clothes. Request to move was accommodated without hassle. Housekeeping did not really clean the room. Floor was dirty by the bed, and the bathtub not clean for bath. No way to make hot water for tea, etc. ", 
    "We stayed at this hotel for 4 nights. Hotel has great location but what we liked the most is the happy hour the hotel offers daily at 5 pm. Staff is very friendly and helpful. For sure we'll stay again on this hotel. ", 
    "Smal rooms, needs security coming up.", 
    "Came into town for 1 night. Check in staff was efficient and helpful. Allowed us to store our 4 bicycles with the front desk. Room size was decent, a bit on the small side, but totally doable. Like that there is a Starbucks within walking distance, Dunkin Donuts as well. Parking Fee's are a joke!!! You can park down the street for much cheaper, though don't leave valuables visible or they will be gone!!!", 
    "Excellent location. Could walk to and from the marathon. Clean room, comfy bed. Room and bathroom a tad small, but it was no big deal.", 
    "Bathroom very small. Closet space is almost nothing. However, great location.", 
    "Older hotel with cool facelift. Small room, but put together well.", 
    "Great hotel and fun decor.", 
    "Really comfortable stay. Happy hour was fun in the lobby. Nice to see the odd dog coming and going. Staff were very friendly and helpful. The concierge helped find a nice brunch spot. The room was a good size, the bathroom was very small, but well appointed. ", 
    "When we arrived for our late arrival they gave us a Queen size room. We paid for a Deluxe King, so needless to say we were disappointed by the size and amenities of the room. It was too late and we were too tired to complain. The lobby and sitting areas are beautiful and uniquely designed, as is the room. Very classy and quirky. Morning coffee/tea was very appreciated. We missed having access to a pool/Jacuzzi however.", 
    "The building is fairly old but the rooms was nicely presented and large. The staff were extremely friendly and helpful. The location is good with shops, bars and restaurants all within close walking distance. Will definitely stay there again when in Chicago.", 
    "I thoroughly enjoyed my stay at the Allegro. It is an easy walk to the Lyric Opera, the theaters, Millennium Park, the Art Institute, etc. My room was a generous size, as was the bathroom. It was very clean and in good condition. The bed was very comfortable. I will certainly stay there again the next time I'm in Chicago.", 
    "This hotel is stylish and located on Randolph St which is the address of many great eateries. Theaters are nearby as are several subway stops. A little farther away but really walkable, is Millenium Park, the Art Institute of Chicago and the river boat tours. I requested a room higher up to avoid the noise from the \"L\". We were on the 18th floor and it was fine. The only noise was from hotel guests returning late and not caring there were others sleeping! The only big negative for us was the tight bathroom but at least it was clean.", 
    "Nice little hotel, conveniently located. It seemed that most of the clients were younger, louder, less considerate of others...I suffered through listening to the young woman in the room next to mine as she moaned her way through the middle of the night. You might want to consider bringing earplugs.", 
    "As all Kimpton Hotels, the Allegro is a bit quirky. The lobby is plush, elevators play non-conventional music and rooms are stylishly decorated. The hotel is on the older side though and while it has clearly been updated there are some signs of its age. The rooms are tiny and the closet wasn't large enough for an actual bar on which to hang clothes. Despite the size, the room was well-appointed, clean and quiet. The attached restaurant is outstanding. A good choice for those looking for a convenient location, but who don't plan on spending a lot of time in the room (b/c it's tiny!).", 
    "The location was perfect to access everything we wanted to see by either walking or public transport. The staff was excellent. We enjoyed the evening wine hours before heading out for the evening.", 
    "The location is convenient, staff are friendly, overall feel very good.", 
    "A good size lobby with tea and coffee in the morning shame they did not have Breakfast tea, only flavoured teas which were very sweet. Free wine tasting in the evening was a nice surprise. A good number of chairs and sofas to sit at. Room was very nice, clean and recently redecorated, reasonable size ditto bathroom which had a lot of comp. items included. ", 
    "Nice hotel in a good location. Lovely staff with good manners. Comfortable bed. Very small room. The lobby carpet made me dizzy. ", 
    "Good experience but very busy hotel with weddings and business travelers. You had to go to lobby for a coffee in the morning or to the a joining Dunkin' Donuts or Starbucks attached to the hotel at the ground floor.This was very busy with commuters.", 
    "The lobby was lovely. But the rooms were super small, poorly renovated, and unpleasant. It felt a little like smoke and mirrors. The rooms and halls are just really really old and not well cared for.", 
    "Have already made my nxt reservation in Nov. Clean with helpful staff, Location was perfect one block off the blue line train.", 
    "Our first stay at a Kimton hotel. Great experience!", 
    "Lovely common spaces. The hotel staff was excellent, making several restaurant suggestions. Nice to have a yoga mat in the room and tv channel to guide in a relaxing routine. really enjoyed the cocktail hour in the beautiful loby.", 
    "My wife and I were only here for a night. We spent the day on Michigan Ave. and needed a place to stay overnight. It was cheaper than the big chains in the area (Hilton, Hyatt, etc.) but the quality didn't suffer. Clean room and friendly staff. Check-in was at 3 but since our room was ready they let us come early. The room was a little smaller but no complaints as we were only there for a few hours. Would recommend; would stay again.", 
    "Solo que cuando compre mi estadia en Hoteles.com decia que contaba con wifi gratis y al llegar me dijeron que eso no estaba incluido y no se hacian responsables por reservaciones en otros sitios.", 
    "Have had very good experiences at Kimpton hotels in Chicago, and went in with high expectations. Checkin was very fast, professional, and courteous. Room was available immediately despite fairly early check-in. Got to room and found everything to be very clean and functional. The only negatives were that vending was only available on even numbered floors, and my room had no place to hang clothes other than the door stop at the top of the room door. The music at the entrance and in the elevators was a little different experience as the hotel really is trying to exhibit a \"hip factor\" Not off putting, but a little comical for us older folks. ", 
    "I like the hotel's lobby, the decoration is nice. Don't miss out the wine hour.", 
    "great location, but hotel itself not so great. small room yes but we were gone most of the day, bed made too much noise. problem was the VERY extremely thin walls. we heard EVERYTHING in rooms next to us. very uncomfortable personal conversations, etc.. bathroom very tiny. but it had everything you need. booked it because of price point . won't book again because of the noise issue.", 
    "Our 3 night stay was quite pleasant. The staff is great, from the frontdesk to the bellboys and cleaning staff. Hotel has a great ambiance (it's a typical older downtown Chicago hotel) and a great bar/restaurant. The room was good but the size of the bathroom is definitely something you have to get used to (if you can). It is VERY small (I am a European and remember bathroom sizes like this back in the old country) It is possible to take a shower, but good luck trying to get into- and out of the tub....It's kind of funny actually. Overall though, we enjoyed our stay. WiFi is only available for free if you sign up to be on the hotel e-mail list and become a \"member\" of their club....I signed up just for the free WiFi. We would go back here now knowing that the bathroom issue is something we have to deal with.", 
    "This is a fine Kimpton hotel in the western Loop. It is very comfortable with fine service and a fine Italian restaurant, 312, on its first floor. Would definitely return if I need to be in the neighborhood.", 
    "The hotel is located in an area that's considered the Theater district. It's great during the day but past 8pm it gets a little dicey. The entrance to the hotel is by no means grand and there are few doormen who help with opening doors and luggage. The lobby is a grand long room that's perfect for relaxing and hanging out. Although crazy busy at times because of free cocktail hour. Fast elevators and our room was nice, no view at all, sort of large with unused space that made you wish they decorated differently. I think they hold open space for beds for kids. They should utilize the space with furniture that makes unpacking and staying there more convenient when you DON'T have roll-outs in the room. Our bathroom was very nicely appointed but so tiny you could almost not move around.", 
    "This is a nice hotel in a really good locality. Staff was friendly. Overall a very satisfactory stay.", 
    "Hotel was just ok and I had expected more having stayed at other Kimpton hotels before. The staff at this one was not so friendly and our room was an adjoining room and it felt like the people in the other room were directly in our room. Bed was comfortable and AC was great so overall our experience was ok but not the great I have come to expect from Kimpton. ", 
    "Hotel was walking distance from many of Chicago's main attractions, which was great. Beautiful lobby and comfortable rooms. Less some weird spotting on the furnature, it was a great stay. ", 
    "Reserved a king room and got a queen. Also, room service would be nice. Couldn't believe the hotel didn't offer it.", 
    "The hotel has a central location near the loop, but it is getting a bit dingy and worn, even though the rooms are cleaned. Time for fresh paint and carpets. The front desk was a bit understaffed.", 
    "I have stayed at this hotel three or four times in the past five years. It is always a pleasant experience and it is close to a number of good moderately priced restaurants. It is also very close to City Hall, County Offices and the Thompson State of Illinois building. If you have business with any of these agencies you cannot go wrong by staying here.", 
    "While staff can be nosy about asking you the experience, the location, room and their service make the remarkable experience overall.", 
    "Rooms clean but small, wifi not free, parking not free, no complimentary breakfast, coffee free and good. The prices are ridiculous in chicago, for the price you pay for a hotel room it could be nicer but it served its purpose, the only reason we chose this hotel was it was 2 blocks from where we had to be.", 
    "The rooms are a bit small but it was still a good hotel in a great location in walking distance from many of the places we love going to when visiting Chicago. We had a room change which took a little longer than it should have but other than that hang up it was great.", 
    "I called in advance to inquire about parking and was told: 1. Self parking is unavailable, and I MUST use their Valet service. 2. Valet will be xx. When driving by, I saw (without searching for) 2 self-parking lots literally under 1 minute away from my hotel which were less than half the price. But I pulled up to the hotel to follow the directions I was given. After valet service had taken my car, I saw a \"xx\" 7 on the wall for Valet.. I asked the desk attendant if any recent changes had been made, and he said \"No.\", but I assumed he wasn't the one I spoke to and didn't bother to take my frustrations out on him. The hotel room I chose was the \"Deluxe King\" bed for a decent bit more than the next cheapest room. It was, by far, the smallest hotel room I've ever been in. The bed was a king sized, as advertised, and it was VERY nice. But the room had very little room outside of that. It felt quite cramped. The \"Best View\" option is what I chose as my 'main preference' during check-in. I honestly think I might've received one of the 'best views', but if that is the case then I believe it shouldn't even be an option as all you could see was directly into some office building across the street. This may be due to the location, as it was my first trip to Chicago, but I was astonished when I asked if I could use a microwave in the dining area and was told it would be ten and they'd bring one to my room instead. Also shocking, fridges were unavailable as well.", 
    "We were in Chicago to visit family and have stayed at the Allegro before. We originally chose the Allegro for location. We wanted a hotel close to the blue line. We returned because it was a nice, well appointed hotel at a reasonable price for the area. I am sure we will return.", 
    "Hotel Allegro is very convenient to public transportation and an easy walk to key attractions like Millenium Park, the museums, and many bars and restaurants. The hotel is small (closets and bathrooms are miniscule), but clean and nicely decorated. The amenities (free wine hour, bike rentals, etc.) are a nice touch. I think for the location and the price, this is a great place to stay for a short trip in Chicago.", 
    "Hotel Allegro is one of the best hotels in/near the loop. I love it because it has it's own identity. It is beautifully decorated, inviting, and reasonably priced. This hotel could likely charge more for it's rooms. They hold your bags for you free of charge if your room is not ready and the complimentary happy hour is very nice.", 
    "This is a great hotel. Staff were great and friendly. The wine reception was nice. Would recommend all the way around.", 
    "It was a simple day trip with an overnight stay for a musical concert. The room was a little smaller than expected, but very comfortable, clean and in a good location for us. Easy to walk downtown too.", 
    "Unique hotel. Colorful with a retro 60's vib.", 
    "Just not impressed. From the beautiful lobby you would expect the same of the room, but the room falls way short. The bathroom is just ridiculously small. Two people cannot be in there at the same time. The windows are very old with paint coming off. The bed was very comfortable. The cleaning staff was very annoying by knocking on the door the first time at 8:30 am, then again 20 mins later and a third time 20 mins after that! Check out is not until noon. So I got the impression they wanted us out of there! Customer service at the front desk was great and so was valet. Would I stay there again, doubtful!", 
    "The decoration of this hotel is very nice and all accomodations were perfect but people at the front desk were not very friendly, maybe because we were French! Too bad!", 
    "Didn't realize until after my stay this was a dog friendly hotel. Wanted a night away from my kids but was kept awake with a barking dog. Will do my research next time. They should keep all dogs on one floor!", 
    "Rooms and service are always great. They have an odd shaped sink that can be a little challenging to use.", 
    "Bathroom was very small for 2 guests to use. The lobby was pleasant and I liked having newspapers there.. Good wine hour....", 
    "the hotel is well located and very close to the orange line i checked in through Expedia and got the room on a high floor I will come again ", 
    "Was in a perfect location as I was in the loop for a business meeting. Nice hotel, in good location", 
    "We had a great visit in Chicago. Hotel Allegro is a very nice hotel. Rooms are fairly small and the walls are kind of thin but the overall stay was very nice.", 
    "Close to the Blue Line for transport to/from O'Hare. Also close access to other L lines for transport around entire city. Enjoyed stay at the hotel and will definitely recommend it to friends/family.", 
    "Our stay was great, though a bit disappointed at first when I called requesting for two double beds. I was told there's no available two double beds room and we will have one king bed. I booked for three people and I said this will not be comfortable. Then I was told by the front desk guy I was talking that \" this is what you get when you booked from a third party\" so rude comment and I don't appreciate it. Btw I booked thru expedia. I requested for a pull away bed and was told of the extra charge of $20.00 per day Despite of the above, we had a great stay and the ambience of the hotel was really great. I like how the guests are being welcome in the lobby through some drinks and finger foods. I feel welcome. Overall , that was a great stay. ", 
    "com ci com ca nothing special but good location ", 
    "Very nice hotel. Perfect location. The only thing the bathroom was VERY small but the hotel has been kept in excellent condition. We had a very nice stay. Chicago is soooooo much fun.", 
    "tres bonne impression nous recommanderons cet hotel. pret de velos gratuits pour visiter la ville.", 
    "The hotel overall was very nice. The bathroom was a little small (Stayed in a King Bed room), but overall it was great! Friendly staff, great amenities, Starbucks in the building. Would definitely stay in again!", 
    "Kimpton hospitality is persistently excellent. Very nice large lobby here accommodated a big crowd for afternoon hosted wine reception. Guest room was small (common with restored boutiques) but nice, clean and well appointed. Great location with 4 theaters, park, restaurants, lake within walking distance.", 
    "No problems. Nice hotel.", 
    "Good Hotel", 
    "Nothing to complain about!! We had a beautiful room on top (15th floor) with a great city view, nice conditioning, very clean, comfy bed and really Everything you need was there! Even charger or iron for hair... First time I met service like that! Plus the shampoo and conditioning for hair (special edition for Kimpton hotels) - just perfect!! I'm gonna buy that for home use. We had a free coffee/water with some berries (very nice idea to put it inside the jar and change berries every day!) in the morning, and wine/sangria in the evening. And the hotel itself is very beautiful with a great design and facilities and really good location! Very impressed and happy about our stay! Would definitely come again! P.S.: did use an opportunity to ride on a free bicycles.. Hope for a next time.. :)", 
    "Nice comfortable clean hotel - lovely decor. Helpful staff.", 
    "I was here for 5 nights on business. The location is at the outlet of the loop so getting around is easy. The rooms are quite small by Chicago standards. The building is dated but superficially updated. The room was clean and the service friendly and accommodating. I did have one problem with the facilities and staff. The lobby would get overloaded at peak hours. This would cause long wait times for elevators to the higher floors. This would be made worse by having a ground and lobby floor. Similarly, a long line formed for bag services. While the elevators are hard to work around, they probably need to hire more staff.", 
    "It was good that the hotel provide compliment coffee in the morning and it happened that on the day there was compliment wine.", 
    "We stayed in a King room. It was nice, but the bed was not very comfortable and the bathroom was tiny. The only way my husband and I could fit in the bathroom together was if one of us was in the shower. Very little counter space.", 
    "Parking: $57/day for valet or $42/day for you park yourself with no In/out services. Internet was extra. A huge room with no sofa or bench.", 
    "The rooms were too small. Most people would appreciate a bigger room.", 
    "We had a 5 day visit to Chicago planned that incorporated both business and pleasure. Our hotel experience complimented a great 5 days in Chicago. We look for clean facilities, good showers and comfortable beds. In addition we enjoyed a great location within walking distance of great shopping, theaters and great night life. In addition we were treated to a nightly wine tasting hour with h'or d'oeuvres in the very nicely laid out lobby area. Not much more you could ask for! Our room had absolutely no view but we did not mind a bit!", 
    "The hotel was packed---I had to wait an hour and a half till almost 4pm for my room to be ready. It ended up having a paper thin door to an adjoining room with loud kids, and best of all, the L train ran right under the room window and shook the whole room. They did accommodate a move, but it was a lower grade than I had booked.", 
    "We enjoyed ourselves and the staff was most helpful. We loved the fact that it had so much character in its design.", 
    "Very kind and friendly staff. Complimentary coffee in the morning, refreshment in the evening. ", 
    "It is close to many attractions and was able to do lot by walking. Close to many hop-on hop-off pickup points. Very convenient.", 
    "Small room; very small bathroom. The staff was pleasant. I wouldn't stay there again.", 
    "It is great location. I had a bad experience with guests next to me who were up partying until 2am. First 2 times I called no answer at the front desk. 3rd time they sent security. After security left they were loud again. I called the front desk and the women told me I had a complaint against myself bc I banged on the wall to let them know they were too loud. She refused to listen to my complaint that they were partying again. I wont stay there again. Very disappointing.", 
    "I stayed in Kimpton Allegro on Saturday night in July. I was able to get a reasonably good rate from Expedia - $200 with taxes for a king bed room. The check in time started at 3 pm. I arrived to the hotel at noon and a receptionist took my phone number and called me an hour later (while I was having lunch in a nearby cafe) to notify me that my room was ready. The room was on the 11th floor. There are only 3 guest elevators in the building and no matter time of day or night, they were always slow/ and full. So one time I ended up using a service elevator, after waiting for a guest elevator for more than 5 minutes. The room was clean and the bed was comfortable. Despite A/C being set to 65 degrees, the room felt dump and humid. The bathroom was small and the toilet was clogged. Before I used it for a first time I had to call maintenance to fix it. They did..and after flashing 3 or 4 sheets of toilet paper it clogged again!!! The ice machines were only on even floors and it so happened that the machines on 10th and 12th floors were out of ice, so it took me a while to fill the ice bucket. Despite the hotel being in a nice location, I would not stay there again... I never had to deal with a clogged toilet in the hotel, and it happened twice here... ", 
    "Enjoyed my stay and noticed needed updates in decor this trip. Allegro Hotel is convenient walk to the Mart, Theaters, and not far from Miracle Mile. Wine tasting is a nice respite after working all day at the Merchandise Mart and the Deco Decadent lobby and rooms are a pleasing sensory overload. Encore restaurant /lounge is also nice looking but needs an expanded menu and next door restaurnt 312 is a bit pricey but great service and ambiance. Happy to stay for future trips!", 
    "No problems with Hotel at all. Location ideal with Train Station only a short walk away.", 
    "Really enjoyed our stay! The service was nice.", 
    "I travel frequently and have stayed at Kimpton hotels before. This stay ruined Kimpton for me. I was moving across the country and chose this hotel as a good place to stop and rest. Under the watch of housekeeping staff, while we were checking in, our cooler with water, food, etc. was stolen from the lobby when we stepped out for a few minutes to move our vehicle. We arrived at 4am, given that our food and water was gone, we asked if they could give us a few bottles of water and snacks or point us in the direction of a vending machine. They declined the request and had us walk to a 24 hour convenient store a few blocks away...at 4am in Chicago. Overall the service was terrible. I called 5 days in advance and the day of to remind them that I'd be traveling with a dog and cat, thinking they'd have a litter box, beds, bowls...not the case, we waited until the next day for a litter box. Do not stay at this hotel. ", 
    "The hotel was very chic, liked the decor and the piano area was a nice touch for gathering with friends. I appreciated the wine-down social at 5pm. The staff was very friendly, rooms were a bit small but comfortable. Only thing missing, aside from the bathroom, there were no other mirrors in the room. Hotel was walking distance to parks and centrally located in the theater district. I would definitely here stay again.", 
    "My husband and I stayed from Thursday night to Sunday morning. The bed was very comfortable and the bathroom is huge. There are plenty of outlets to plug in ipads, phone chargers, etc. It's a very loud hotel-there is loud music playing in the entrance and lobby of hotel, and from your room you can hear people in the hallway and people on the floor above you. The workout room is really nice-with plenty of towels, water and late-model exercise machines. The room is set at 66 degrees and when we moved the thermostat to 70, the heat kicked on. The room is small-only the bed and a small desk. The staff is very nice. ", 
    "Able to check in a little early and parking was close by. Liked internal entrances to Encore for great drinks and to 312 Chicago for an excellent dinner with superb service and a great breakfast with superb service. Convenient for walking to the Oriental Theater to see Motown. Disappointed in the size of the Deluxe king size bed room and bathroom and other negative features such as no loveseat or additional seating, a coffee maker and other amenities compared to other hotels we have stayed at in downtown Chicago. I marked Yes for recommending this hotel to a friend because of its location to surrounding theaters, restaurants, and points of interest and not for the quality of the hotel room features.", 
    "Room was dark and only had one an uncomfortable desk chair to sit in. Room was clean and the housekeeping staff was very nice. ", 
    "A nice, modern hotel in the theater district. Complimentary coffee & tea in the morning, wine/beer in the evenings. Close to the Blue Line and within walking distance of the Red Line and a number of buses. A 10 minute walk to Millenium Park & Grant Park. Room was small and the bed was a little softer than we were used to, but all in all, a good place to sleep every night! We'd stay again if in Chicago soon!!", 
    "Enjoyed it greatly", 
    "Great location but the room was gross and our view was a brick wall. I am usually so impressed by Kimpton's (I use them all the time for work) but this was my first time staying for pleasure and it was a huge disappointment", 
    "The entrance to the hotel was dramatic, which makes sense considering it is in the theater district. The decor was astonishing, in a good way. I have never stayed in a Kimpton hotel before, but have been told that each one is decorated individually. The lobby was huge and inviting, with several different areas with slightly different styles in the different rooms. The staff were pleasant to interact with. I didn't use the concierge (as I used to live in Chicago), but she seemed reasonably knowledgeable about what was available to do in the area. People did seem to interact a bit in the lobby, where there was coffee/tea in the morning and wine/beer in the evening. They are pretty good with details, such as a different fruit or mint infused in the water available in the lobby each day. The rooms are a little smaller than some places, but that is typical for many older or historic buildings in the Chicago Loop - and the design makes clever use of the space. I even had a bit of a view from my window. ", 
    "Hotel was very modern and clean. Location is great! In the loop, in theater district. Can walk to a lot or take the L which isn't far either. Great amenities and VERY friendly staff. Will ALWAYS stay here when visiting Chicago. Plan to find Kimpton hotels in other cities after this experience. ", 
    "Awesome hotel", 
    "Allegro is an excellent choice for either the casual traveler or the business professional that enjoys socializing. The 5pm wine hour works well for either of these, and the helpful staff is always ready to answer questions about the hotel or surrounding area as they pour your refreshment. Excellent price for the quality of the hotel. Well appointed, good coffee, free paper, and quality bedding. The other guests are the hotel's greatest asset: take advantage of the cocktail hour even if you choose not to imbibe. Have a soft drink and enjoy your fellow travelers. There's no telling who you may meet. Will be staying here again soon.", 
    "The hotel was a terrible experience. They charge for WiFi, and then charged us a huge minibar fee because we pulled out soda and a bottle of wine from the fridge to make room for our own drinks one night. The sodas and wine were right on top of the minifridge, but we were still charged daily for the drinks. I tried to speak to the front desk about this, but they said that pulling the sodas out of the fridge was equivalent to drinking them. There was also no room service, and the delivered food we left by the trash was never picked up unless it was in the small trash bins. Each day the maids knocked on the door at 9am, which is a little early when your room doesn't come with do not disturb sign and the bed is so uncomfortable we both woke up like 3-4 times per night. The place was pretty empty, and yet they put us in a room that had a brick wall that was 2 feet from our window. You could reach out the window and touch the next door building. The room was dark with no light. The 'deluxe' king room had nowhere to sit, one chair at the desk and just enough room to fit a tv, desk and king bed. My boyfriend and I were constantly walking on top of each other, there was barely enough room to walk by the bed it was so close to the wall. Given how empty the hotel was, it was a real shame they put paying customers in a room so small with such a horrible view of the city and such an uncomfortable bed. I will never stay here or any other Klimpton hotel again", 
    "The hotel and the room were very nice and clean. However there was no closet space or drawers. Room was very small and the bathroom smaller. All in all I would stay there again but only for short visits due to the lack of space. Front desk was very courteous and helpful."

    "Convenient location just south of the river and north of Millenium Park. Clean, comfortable and fantastic doormen made our stay very comfortable. Would definitely recommend. ", 
    "Please that I was able to get an early check-in, the hotel staff was very helpful with this. Overall it looks like some upgrades are needed. I was shocked that the bar closed at 10:30, though the items in the room stated it was open until midnight. Also, it indicated 24 hour room service, but I could not locate a menu in the room.", 
    "Excellent location; suite; staff....we were very happy....Zero complaints.", 
    "Nice but way overpriced. Room view was spectacular from Room 3002. Sink slow to drain. Top tile baseboard dirty. Staff excellent in attitude and service.", 
    "I would definitely return for another stay, great location!", 
    "Overall had a very great stay. Treated very well. Rooms are very nice. Location is unbeatable.", 
    "Everything was great except parking. It was difficult to find it. And one more unpleasant situation than my fried checked in reception took cash deposit and didn't say anything what for he took money and also he didn't give a receipt. Just than I came and asked what for she paid money. He said that was deposit and gave receipt. ", 
    "Easy to walk to Magnificent Mile, Pier, Parks, Shopping.", 
    "Really enjoyed the stay. Only problem is everything is aka carte: Internet, refrigerator, etc. Also, the location is great but hard to find due to several levels of streets right there. If you can afford it, go for it!", 
    "Nice Hotel, Good View, Comfortable Room, Great Location", 
    "I had an amazing experience at the Fairmont. The staff was more than accommodating, and everyone went out of their way to make my group feel comfortable. Highly recommended!", 
    "Wonderful hotel close to beautiful Millenium Park and lots of resturants and shops ", 
    "This hotel was extremely clean, staff was excellent and helpful and Sushi was better than many of the local restaurants. We usually stay at another local boutique hotel downtown but this one has a much better restaurant on site.", 
    "Best view from our room ever. Could see the park, aquarium, lake front south, etc. Really cool looking, The staff made us feel special with little extras provided for our stay. They quickly fixed the clock in the room when it stopped and provided extra coffee. The bed was one of the better, more comfortable ones I have had in a top hotel. Great location for all downtown activities. The business center was useful and the person on duty there was most helpful.", 
    "Excellent hotel! Excellent service! Restaurants and shops are walking distance!", 
    "Great stay. Wish WiFi was included for free, other than that fantastic!", 
    "We had a great time . Every one was very helpful. Very nice place to stay", 
    "In town for business purposes. Stayed at The Fairmont because it was connected to the Aon Center with the pedestrian walk. This was so nice because there was no reason to go outdoors to get to my meeting. Had never visited Chicago before, and this was the perfect place to stay to get a good feel for the city.", 
    "Wonderful stay very happy, the staff were very helpful. ", 
    "Is was real clean and staff were really nice I well stay there many more times love like view of Lake Michigan ", 
    "It's a Great hotel and their service it's very professional ", 
    "The Fairmont is a good hotel. It's not on Michigan Ave., so if that's important to you, look elsewhere.", 
    "Lovely time celebrating a wonderful family celebration. Hotel was just perfect for the occasion!", 
    "I didn't like the shower head or the pillows but I'm funny like that. Nice hotel in a good location. ", 
    "Short stay, nice hotel, great location. City center", 
    "Loved the lobby and rooms. Alex, the concierge, was outstanding. The bellmen and valet and doorman were as friendly as ine could ask. Everyone welcomed my small dog. Bath and beds were lovely. Unfortunately, the front desk check in man refused to smile or even grin. They didn't replenish the coffee service or mugs on day 2 and didn't drop off the newspaper on day 2. Otherwise lovel . ", 
    "Was an amazing hotel. the staff was on point and able to help with any needs that came up. They allowed us to check in early as our room was ready and we arrived several hours early. The only thing that kept this hotel from a perfect rating was the mini fridge was in a cabinet creating a high degree if heat and was falling apart. Other than that, I cannot imagine a better spot to enjoy downtown Chicago as a base. I will return again and again for my weekend getaways.", 
    "Allowed for late check in. Wifi and local phone calls are not complimentary. Was charged for drinks that were not consumed.", 
    "I love staying here when I travel to Chicago for business. I have never had a bad experience. The internet is a little on the expensive side. Restaurants nearby tend to close early on weekdays so late meals are limited.", 
    "Great stay for my wife and I. Clean suite and fantastic views. A bit chilly in room, had heat up, but it stayed cold anyway. Other than that great and I will return.", 
    "Wine Bar staff was not hospitable and not welcoming. Focused on inventory; not guests. Paper cups for tea? To go boxes for cheese to take to room? Inept staff in terms of training, basic manners and dealing with guests .", 
    "Me and my boyfriend had a big corner suite. It was really nice but the room service pizza was disgusting. It was super greasy and the cheese wasn't melted", 
    "Was a great stay will stay again", 
    "Wonderful, comfortable, hotel. A little tricky finding the upper Columbus Street location but close to everything.", 
    "Great stay at this hotel for valentines day, sadly they only had doubles available even though I requested King so beware they may not have your room of choice. Stayed at The James for our second night and kept wishing we were back at the Fairmont.", 
    "Awesome hotel however the only problem we had was that the heating system in our room didn't work. They attempted to fix it twice only to find out that the motor was broken, with no other rooms available that night and the hotel didn't offer anything for our troubles, we ended up sleeping clothed in a cold room. I'm certain that this was an isolated incident, however something should have been done for our troubles.", 
    "needs remodeling will not recomend to anyone rooms too dirty ", 
    "Friendly staff, beautiful room, clean and modern. The location is close to Navy Pier and museums.", 
    "We really enjoyed staying at the Fairmont Hotel. This is one of our favorite hotel to stay when we come to Chicago.", 
    "Fabulous hotel! We enjoyed our stay and will stay there again", 
    "Stayed here a number of times and it is consistently clean and comfortable. Conveniently attached underground to the Aon Building so you don't have to endure winter weather.", 
    "Overall very well done hotel. Avoid the room service pizza though, it is very bad.", 
    "We were supposed to stay on a Fairmont Gold floor. Unfortunately when we arrived at our private concierge on the 15th floor, there were no double rooms available. We were put on the 32nd floor, but were given access to all the amenities associated with Fairmont Gold status. To say our experience was luxurious is an understatement. Complimentary food was served 4 different times a day in the private lounge, all types of beverages were available 24 hours, we had complimentary hi-speed internet access, I was awakened each morning with complimentary coffee delivered to my room and I had access to a large-screen computer monitor with complimentary printing. When the snow hit on Sunday and we were confined to the hotel, I was able to get a great deal of work done in the lounge and even had a fabulous Lobster Roll delivered to me for lunch. The attendants in the lounge were fabulous and very accommodating. My traveling companion developed a stomach flu during the trip and one of the attendants was able to recommend a specific type of tea for me to bring back to the room for her. The breakfasts were sumptuous...not sure what they did with the bacon, but it was incredible and the croissants were flaky and light. I was even able to have bagels and lox every morning! I can't say enough good things about the service we received in the Fairmont Gold lounge.", 
    "We were attending a large dog show and decided to stay at a real hotel! The Fairmont did not disappoint. All expectations were exceeded.", 
    "Chicago very cold for me who is used to living the tropics. Nice & warm in the hotel. Breakfast very good in the dining room/ lounge room which affords good views of Chicago & excellent ambience. There were no tea making facilities nor complimentary bottled water, which I'm used to in Asian hotels.", 
    "I stayed here a couple of times, and everything is always top notch, 1st class! The service is always outstanding from everyone that works there!", 
    "enjoyed two nights in a lovely suite, great location to walk to most all events downtown Chicago", 
    "Everything was excellent -- hotel, room, service, staff.",

    "Phone broken! Elevators extremely loud, no sleep! Forgot my razor, front desk said they would bring one up. They never showed up", 
    "Was a Great experince I really love every single thing", 
    "My husband and I spent a few days in the city when he came home on military leave. We were recommended this hotel. The location is great, we wanted to be near the park, but that's about all we liked. Compared to other hotels we stayed at in the city, this was probably the most expensive and also the one we disliked the most. The room we chose through expedia had a king sized bed and a city view. Once we got there we were given a double room, we quickly got that changed back to a king, but we didn't have the city view we were supposed to have. We also wanted a room with a bath but were extremely disappointed when the bath plug to the drain did not work at all. It's just not worth the price. There are quite a few places that we've stayed at downtown that were half the price, way nicer, and included things like complimentary internet and breakfast.", 
    "Nice hotel with an excellent location downtown...close to restaurants", 
    "The room was amazing. Very neat and was very comfortable.", 
    "Loved our stay. Close to Millennium Park (our main destination). Staff was friendly and accommodating. Lake view. Quite. Nicely appointed room. Beverages in fridge was for fee but it wasn't clear if coffee was complementary so we didn't touch it. Disappointed to learn that wifi and fitness center was not complimentary. Online description, as well as direct hotel site, was vague. Front-desk staff recognized our disappointment and gave us 24-hr free wifi. Not a big deal since we stayed only 1 night. If we were to stay longer, we'd stay elsewhere. Why is it these high-end hotels charge for wi-fi? There's a proposal in congress for hotels to be able to block hotspots - I definitely would not frequent them. Otherwise, nice stay.", 
    "Nice hotel clean rooms would stay again close to shopping and resturants nice view of fireworks", 
    "everything was perfect if I had to find 1 thing to complain about it would be Parking I know its Chicago and I know parking is expensive but $65.00 is a bit much. That said I had a wonderful time checkin check out was a breeze place was imaculate veiw was great and everything is close ", 
    "We celebrated NYE 2015 at The Fairmont Chicago. Our room was clean and the bed was comfortable. The hotel staff was kind and attentive, even on a busy New Year's Eve. Short cab ride from Union Station. I would definitely stay here again.", 
    "Close to Michigan Ave highlights but not as convenient to restaurant choices especially on a Sunday or holiday morning. Overall a very good choice.", 
    "Great hotel. We checked out at noon, but the valet service allowed us to spend the day in the city before having to get the car, thus we didn't have to pay to park somewhere else.", 
    "My wife had visited the hotel prior to a recent remodeling and was very disappointed upon her return. The room was clean, but its update made it completely bland. The coffee maker worked well enough, but was strangely tucked in a cabinet under the TV instead of the beverage area outside of the bathroom. The worst part of the room was the bed: a king size with two well-defined divots that was only slightly less comfortable than a hammock...not what was expected for a hotel in this area and at this price point.", 
    "The Fairmont Chicago has the \"Best of the Best\" in Customer Service/Guest Experience of all the hotels I have stayed at over the past couple of years. I frequently travel from as far as north as Toronto, to as far west as California, and the customer service/guest experience my husband and I recently received at the Fairmont over New Year's was hands down the \"BEST OF BREED\". We booked a room on the Fairmont Club 15th floor, which offers some extra amenities such as a private guest lounge area with a panoramic view of Chicago, and they serve free breakfast, an early evening cocktail hour with a full service (cash) bar. All of these things make the Fairmont a bit more special and stand out from other hotels, but their number one best asset is they have the most wonderful and accommodating staff we have had the pleasure to meet. We received a private check in staff and concierge on our floor who were by far, the nicest group of folks who went way beyond the call of duty. Cody was the best Concierge/Supervisor along with Henry, Hayley, Alex and even the front door staff member Benjamin was an absolute delight, all of them went out of their way to ensure we had everything possible to enjoy our stay. They went over and beyond the call of duty on a daily basis to ensure we had the best guest experience possible. The Fairmont is very lucky to have such dedicated and wonderful staff who truly care about the guest experience. BRAVO FAIRMONT STAFF & THANK YOU!", 
    "We stayed at the Fairmont for three nights. It is a beautiful, clean hotel near the Magnificent Mile and other attractions. A cab ride to restaurants and museums was very reasonable. The staff was generally friendly. We enjoyed the New Year's Eve fireworks from Navy Pier. I would have given this hotel a higher rating except for the following: High fees for internet service and parking. On-site restaurant was outrageously expensive. My biggest problem was with the doors to the rooms. All the doors would slam shut. All night long I could hear the creak of the door handles to other rooms, then I would count to three, and the doors would slam shut. Our friends that also stayed in the hotel could hear the elevator all night. ", 
    "I stayed for New Year's Eve & was placed in a corner room. The hotel has electric heat and our room was so drafty. We turned the thermostat up to 90 degrees and our room continued to be 60 degrees. Staff did a great job of accommodating us by moving us into a more centralized room. If you plan on staying here, try to avoid the corner rooms!", 
    "Amazing hotel! Rooms were clean, classy, and comfortable. Location is great and hotel staff was extremely accommodating. Definitely plan to retun.", 
    "Fighing on my floor Lots of yelling and couldn't sleep", 
    "We spent New Years Eve in Chicago at this lovely hotel. Our room had a great view of Millenium Park. We will stay here again.", 
    "perfect", 
    "Wonderful!", 
    "The hotel was great, room was very nice and clean,the view was AMAZING. Overall, everything was perfect for our New Years Eve stay.", 
    "Clean room and friendly staff. Stayed on the Gold floors with the lounge, and was worth the up charge.", 
    "It is a nice hotel that is trying to stay exclusive but it looks like it is slowly degrading. The beds are extremely small and the rooms, while luxurious, are starting to show their age. Because of the low price compared to other hotels in the area, they attract some questionable characters. Amenities and restaurants in the hotel are expensive.", 
    "Good location and generally convenient to most activities. However, this hotel needs upgrading for sure if it is to live up to the Fairnont experience. Hotel restaurant was very average.", 
    "We stayed at the Fairmont Hotel for New Year's Eve. The location is ideal as it is near Millennium Park. Also, near Michigan Ave and a short walk to Navy Pier. The rooms are nicely decorated and we loved the separate tub and shower in the bathroom. The beds were nice and comfortable too! We would definitely stay there again.!", 
    "I booked this hotel to bring in the New Year with my wife. We arrived their were valet vehicles everywhere. We had to wait approx 30 before they took my vehicle. We were referred by the the food was excellent at the hotel restaurant The food was very salty and not well cooked. Our room was freezing cold maintenance was contacted and he changed the filter and called housekeeping to bring us more blankets. We were told to put a blanket at the food it should help with the draft coming from the hall. Well it didn't the bath was so cold we couldn't take a shower so we left the hotel at 5:00am. The manager credit the valet of $65.00 and another night stay on them. I declined to go through what me and my wife experience a second time.", 
    "Had a good time wish my lamp with the ipod doc worked ", 
    "Overall the hotel and the room were very good the room had some issues one it was cold despite trying to increase heat. Also the heating unit was very dirty from when you looked at it from the side plus one of the telephones did not work", 
    "This is a very difficult review to write because I am torn. The entire staff couldn't have been friendlier and nicer if they tried. We checked in on Christmas night so we could hang out downtown the day after with our 3 yr old. Got a very nice stocking w/our name on it filled with goodies-- thoughtful! The hotel is dated and a little bit dingy(hallways dark), but clean. Can't beat the location(Millennium Park!)and the staff. Room layout was a little wonky and small. Room service was efficient and good(expensive, but that's room service, ya know?) Figure out what's important to you, but good service is worth a lot in my book so I'd come back for that. However if I was trying to impress anyone probably wouldn't do it here. And once again, Hotel.com is so great to work with!", 
    "We had a very nice sized suite, bathroom layout was especially good for a family with a vanity area just outside the bathroom as well as spacious counter inside. Ordered room service which was very good. Pet friendly. Would definitely stay here again.", 
    "Usually great but definitely dissapointed this time. Room was not ready for guests. ", 
    "The hotel is conveniently located. Close to many downtown attractions. Rooms are standard, nothing special for the price. The on-site restaurant \"Aria\" is terrible. Don't eat there. Food is greasy and cold; fruit flies are around. I returned my breakfast to the kitchen. They didn't remake it, instead they just warmed up a plate. Not only was I not offered a complimentary meal but even another choice was not given. Poor customer service. ", 
    "I have stayed at the Fairmont a couple of times and my only complaint would be that they had no tv guide. I especially like that they have a separate makeup area with a lighted magnifying mirror..every hotel should have that. Great location, close to everything. Last stay we had a better view, but our latest room wasn't too bad either. I would definitely choose this hotel again.", 
    "Perfect. We went for a getaway to see the Christmas market. The location was perfect for everything we wanted to see and do. The staff was friendly and the room was amazing.", 
    "The hotel features a grand entry and a huge, impressive, if somewhat cold, lobby. The rooms are pleasant, but not particularly special. The amenities are okay. The staff is pleasant and people are polite. It's not at all a bad place to stay. The location is especially central to the Magnificent Mile and a block from Millenium Park.", 
    "As usual, great", 
    "It is a very nice hotel and very convenient. The staff is very friendly! The room was very well appointed and clean.", 
    "The bed was great, health club was nice and we used it, very quiet. On the down side, there was no bedside clock! And getting a taxi took a little time because of the hotel location off the beaten path", 
    "The three room suite at the weekend rate is the best hotel bargain in town. The rate is about what the other fine hotels charge for a regular room.", 
    "It was amazing.", 
    "The hotel rooms are a bit outdated and in need of refurbishing. The club level lounge was just adequate. It also needs updating.", 
    "Stayed here for a girls weekend with my sisters, it was within walking distance to Michigan Ave, State St, Millenium Park,...just to name a few. The hotel was very nice for the price. Very Friendly staff. My only complaint is the walls seem thin and you can hear other guests next door....either that or the guests next door to us were just extra loud. Overall I would definitely stay here again!", 
    "The hotel was beautiful. The room (we had a king suite) was beautifully appointed. Both the bed and pull out sofa were comfortable and offered a good night's sleep. The bathroom was large and offered a separate boudoir/dressing area with a walk in closet. The staff was very accommodating and friendly. My only, very minor negative observation were a couple of places in the room that showed some wear and tear. A corner of peeling wallpaper, a spot or two of smudges on the paint. Minor cosmetic details. Otherwise, perfect in every way. The hotel is 1/2 mile from the Art Institute, less than a mile from shopping on Michigan Avenue and across the street from Millennium and Grant Parks. Our room had a beautiful city view with glimpses of the lake beyond. The Fairmont is our new regular place to stay when in Chicago.", 
    "Room was very clean, liked the big bathroom, however, I wouldnt consider that a waterfall shower head. The only problem I had was u could hear everything in the next room making it difficult to sleep", 
    "My stay was incredible. The hotel was gorgeous and the staff were nice.. lady at front desk gave us a room with an awesome view. I will definitely be back.", 
    "Perfect!", 
    "The concierges were amazing. Really took time with us, and their recommendations were great!", 
    "this is an awesome hotel. It is in a great location of the hotel stuff is amazing, and some great amenities. Housekeeping does not do a good job on a daily basis of cleaning the room. Everyday, dirty dishes were left in our room. The coffee supply was not refreshed, and the trash was not emptied. Other than that, I highly recommend this hotel.", 
    "Nice hotel - room walls are paper thin though and you can hear everything your neighbor is doing. ", 
    "Beautiful hotel with very friendly staff. Breakfast was wry good. Fitness center much bigger than I anticipated and more than enough state of the art equipment.", 
    "Everything you would expect when you get to this hotel, from the staff to the service and the restaurant. Great location and a great experience.", 
    "Excellent staff, very helpful. Food was wonderful. View of city awesome from room. Easy access to Michigan Ave and other sites.", 
    "From check-in to check -out it was a great experience, The Registrars, BellMen, Concierges and Taxi Guys were all helpful and gracious. I've traveled extensively through the US, Europe & Asia and can say that this is a Great Hotel. 5 Stars.", 
    "Great hotel overall. It need some renovations in the hallways. Rooms are clean, the bathrrom very spacious and nice", 
    "Close to Navy Pier, Soldier Field and Millennium Park. In the loop for great access to public transportation. The hotel is typical mediocre room, with an extra cost for everything. No pool or hot tub and no free WiFi ($14/day). ", 
    "Walking distance to just about every attraction. Cabs from hotel not that expensive to farther away attractions", 
    "We were very happy. After staying Fairmont for 3 times we were gold member for extra benefit which makes different.", 
    "Very nice lake view @34th floor Room was very clean and nice with a lot space Liked it ", 
    "The room was nice and clean. It was spacious, warm and comfortable. Bathroom was so clean and smells fresh with enough towels except for limited toiletries. I had a wonderful time.", 
    "Excellent location, service, staff, clean, professional, no problems whatsoever. ", 
    "We enjoyed our visit - Great service!", 
    "I knew I wanted to be close to the Magnificient Mile and saw this hotel worked well, but I didn't realize the bonus of being on that end and then close to State street and the museum and great art installations out that way of South Michigan street. I found the room very well appointed and everything very comfortable. It was a grand, yet cozy, classic nice hotel and I would happily book there again. ", 
    "everything was seamless, from arrival to departure. Excellent service, loved the location.", 
    "Good experience, would recommend to others. The size of the rooms, cleanliness, bed comfort, access to cabs and other transportation and easy access to Michigan Avenue sold me!", 
    "I left my shoes outside the door of my room on the first night to be cleaned and was surprised when they were not returned the next day. After I made several calls to housekeeping I got a call from Guest Services Manager to advise that they would extensively search the hotel for my shoes, the manager did give me the impression that it was my fault for leaving the shoes outside the door and things get stolen in this hotel - this is the last I heard from anyone in the hotel about my shoes.", 
    "Great experience from check in to check out. Fantastic location, a 3 minute walk to\"the bean\". Well maintained, clean, great staff. ", 
    "Stayed at the Fairmont Chicago at Millennium Park for a weekend get away and had a great time. The staff was friendly and helpful. Room was very clean and in great condition. I would recommend this hotel for a stay in Chicago. ", 
    "Could hear a lot. I mean, a LOT: out in the hallway, rooms next door and above flushing, etc. Expected a bit more. Location was fabulous, but may try a different Hotel in the neighborhood next time.", 
    "Had a fabulous time in Chicago. The Fairmont was very comfortable. Wonderful beds! The Concierge was incredibly helpful - her recommendations were 5 star.", 
    "Rooms were clean, nicely updated. Staff was super-responsive to request to change rooms (in order to have adjoining rooms), request to fix a slow-draining shower, etc. Concierge was extremely helpful with great recommendations for restaurants and activities.", 
    "Only there for one night. Obvious up scale place. Clean, comfortable, and central to most downtown attractions.", 
    "Great stay at a world-class property. Attentive staff and wonderful accommodations. Wish my stay was longer!", 
    "Here for Chicago marathon. Perfect location", 
    "Wonderful!!! You just go and get excellent experience.", 
    "I love view of lake. Very clean and friendly. P", 
    "The hotel is very nice but they include nothing in the very high room rate. the gym, wi-fi, breakfast, parking are not only not included but also very expensive. Also, the bathroom shower was not great and there was no plug so you could not take a bath. I would not stay there again.", 
    "Not sure when this hotel was built or when was the last time they remodeled. But, it can certainly use some needed updating, such as newer and better beds, fixing broken tiles in bathroom, and brightening the lobby area.", 
    "Check in was fast. The beds were awesome. Nice to have a coffee maker in the room. The paper of your choice at your door was a plus. For our activities the position of the hotel was great. Great view from our window.", 
    "It was a nice hotel. More dining options would be nice.", 
    "The hotel itself is quite good. Staff was courteous and attentive, and our room was comfortable. The on-site restaurant, however, was atrocious. Why pay $50 for greasy, overcooked breakfast and bad coffee for two when you can get the same thing at Denny's for $4 a piece?", 
    "I was able to book a room in downtown Chicago the day before I needed it. Not only was the hotel amazing and our rate low, we actually even got a free upgrade! Just be aware of additional parking fees in larger cities. We called ahead to confirm the room and parking fees. Our booking was in their system in less than 5 minutes! ", 
    "We were so pleasantly surprised by our experience at the Fairmont. We thought that by booking with Hotels.com, we'd get a mediocre room, but were so thrilled to have a room on the 30th floor with a view of the lake. It was superb!", 
    "We booked the hotel due to its four stars and great location. It is convenient to walk around and check out night life in Chicago. However, the room is dirty-- the sheets and pillow cases have dirty, black spots, the room has rotten smell. And they nickel and dimed you for any service, even a bottle of water. There is no free WIFI. Overall, it does not fulfill its so claimed four stars hotel. ", 
    "I was in the Farimont for only one night - Sunday, Sept 14. It is a splendid hotel and my room was all that I could ask for with a great view of the Lake and comfortable furnishings and amenities. I was made to feel very welcome even thought I was using Hotel.com which the Hotel was using to fill its vacant rooms. Some other hotels are not as welcoming.", 
    "Great staff, friendly and helpful. Nice rooms. Close to everything.", 
    "The hotel was beautiful, comfortable and the staff were excellent. I especially liked the location, it was convenient and also offered plenty of privacy. I will definitely stay here again and so will my traveling friends Who had their own rooms.", 
    "Nice room with partial south view of the park, harbor, and Soldier Field. Comfy king bed with quality pillows, linens, etc. A bit pricey, but most hotels of that quality and similar location were priced in the same range.", 
    "The staff were so friendly & went out of their way to make us feel welcome. Beds were so comfortable and everything was very clean. Would definitely stay here again. Outstanding!", 
    "This must have been a great hotel but a major update is required", 
    "Came in late on Friday, great lobby decor, excellent service. Large room for a downtown location", 
    "Walking distance to boat tours and water taxis as well as Millennium Park and Lake Michigan. Excellent view, pleasant staff, spacious, clean and quiet room made for a great stay.", 
    "Impecable. Highly recommended. Clean, service was excellent, just overall great stay!", 
    "Lovely hotel. I would stay there again. Concierge (Gail) was very helpful with dinning options and arranging limo transportation!", 
    "Great location within walking distance of Millennium Park.. Staff was great and very helpful.. The hotel could stand to be updated but was clean and comfortable.", 
    "Excellent location and superb room. Concierge very helpful. Hotel accommodated early checking and late checkout without any hassle.", 
    "Well a little upset about the room, I was told I was getting a suite and when we arrived and checked in I was given joining rooms, the issue for me is that I was not made aware of this and had to sleep in the same bed with someone else. When I made the front desk aware of this they did not seem to care. I was told that I could have an early check in which did not happen, I was told I could check in at 3pm which did not happen, I was told that other guest who did not check in by 3pm were given a discount and that did not happen for me.The room was very clean.", 
    "Check in was at 3. We had to wait until 4 for an available room. The carpet was wet in the room.", 
    "We had to wait allot 2 hours after check in to get in our room. I also called to make the reservation to make sure we could have a roll away bed and then at check in they said they couldn't do that. So they told me they upgraded our room. We had two double beds and a small couch. We had 5 people. They didn't do anything other than the upgrade. We should have been given a discount for the wait and trouble. Didn't even really get a sorry for the wait. When we were leaving we had to wait 40 min to get out car. Paid $65 to park. Just a block away we could have parked for $14. Not going back to this hotel.", 
    "My wife and I had a great time in Chicago. The hotel was near a couple of great restaurants, especially Wildberry (breakfast) it was amazing. It is very close to Millennium Park, and maybe some rooms actually had views of it, but ours was mostly blocked by another building, however we did get a great view of Lake Michigan. Very near lake shore which is really great. A bit of a walk for the main section of Michigan Ave., but not to bad. We would definitely stay here again.", 
    "I thought that for the money we spent for one night I was expecting a LOT more in luxury! Room was very simple - like any other type of hotel. Room was clean, but the bathroom floor was wet - not sure why - if cleaning was just done or what but that bothered us a bit. Nothing special about the room at all. I did not like the fact that if we wanted a fridge, or other amenities, etc., all that was at an extra charge. With what they charge for rooms there should be more complimentary items! One very nice thing I did like very much was the views out the windows! The location was really nice - close to most things we wanted to see/do. The service of staff was very good and attentive..", 
    "It was extremely to get to the hotel and back on the highway. The hotel was clean and modern and the Aria food and room service was fantastic! We wi definitely stay there again!", 
    "Great hotel, great staff enjoyed our stay. Walking around for us with the loop was a bit confusing and took up more time, but that was all on us!", 
    "This hotel is extremely well located within a short distance from all major attractions downtown Chicago. It is equally close to Magnificent Mile, waterfront, all major museums and theaters.", 
    "We enjoyed this hotel. Staff was very friendly and we had a nice city view. Beds were comfy, too. ", 
    "i enjoyed my stay here, very nice rooms, very nice hotel. Inside the hotel there is a very nice bar and restaurant. They have a small gym. BEWARE OF PARKING at the hotel for over night, they will charge you $70!!!!! for valet!?!? thats ridiculous, but whatever its a nice hotel, i will definitely stay here again, just not drive there anymore. There is a CVS across the street that is very very convenient. The restrooms in the rooms are amazingly nice. ", 
    "Its close to everything, it was very clean and it had great views. Beds were comfortable and the staff was nice", 
    "I paid 65$ for parking over night. Requested for 10more minutes beyond checkout time and response was very very bad from the front desk", 
    "Everyone was very kind and caring. They helped in every aspect to get us settled in. Room was great, clean and ready for us when we checked in. The staff was wonderful always greeting you and smiling. The room had two double beds and there wasn't a thing out of place. Clean, clean clean!!!!!", 
    "I thought the Fairmont was a very nice hotel. We had a room with a city view and a partial lake view. The room was a good size with a large bathroom. The only complaint I would have would be the cleaning service didn't leave us new soap and hand towels. We called down and got them right away.", 
    "My husband and I stayed here for our 5 year anniversary, and the hotel pulled out all the stops for us, bringing us chocolate strawberries and champagne on the house! The room was new, clean and very quiet. We didn't hear any guests while we were there. And the food in the club quarters on the 15th floor was amazing! We may just make this an annual tradition. Oh, and the location is perfect for going anywhere in the loop.", 
    "Was expecting a nice experience with good amenities and staff/quality of hotel but was disappointed. Felt un-welcomed.", 
    "I figured that when you pay 300 dollars for a hotel you wouldn't have to pay 10 dollars for the internet or 65 for parking... Or 3.50 for a cup of coffee in the morning, I was wrong. I will go back to staying in 3 star hotels now.", 
    "Was a great experience for our first visit in Chicago. Good location to Michigan Avenue.", 
    "Hotel was much nicer than expected for the price we paid. Great location....walking distance to millenium and grant park, Riverwalk, navy pier and even sky deck. The staff was very friendly and helpful answering questions as it was our first time in Chicago. Everything was clean and our room layout was great with great views (we were on 34rd floor). I would definitely stay there again!", 
    "I dragged myself up to the reception counter feeling like I had been walking through the desert. The clerk had some cocacola sent up to my room which was fantastic, and started my stay as one of the best I have had in Chicago. The suite was clean with the exception of mold around the inside of the shower stall. The bed could only be described as memory foam - it held the position of the last 500 people who slept in it. It only lacked police tape outlining the spot I slept in. Seriously, had I ordered room service in bed it would have been delivered to the floor below. To their credit they put me in a new room the next day - so fair enough. I slept well and everything was clean. This only leaves the internet. This must have been the one Al Gore created. The \"high speed\" cable and the wireless couldn't wait to start throwing trojans on my laptops - they aren't using protection, or if they are..err... it has a hole in it. This is a show stopper - the connections were constantly dropping. This is the only hotel in Chicago that my personal hotspot wouldn't work. ", 
    "I will return I was pleased with the whole package. ", 
    "A very good stay. Everything was clean and the service was great. Staff went the extra mile. Wonderful .", 
    "I don't know what material you use for the bed & pillows but I slept SO GOOD! Hotel is wonderful. No complaints.", 
    "helpful staff, clean room. great location walking distance from everything downtown. Seems like they could throw in free internet access, and access to the pool at the associated gym next door. it annoys me that nice hotels like this nickle and dime their guests.", 
    "Very good hotel, excellent location, and friendly staff.", 
    "NIce place, clean, good staff. About what you would espect from a Chicago downtown hotel for the money - pay for everything.", 
    "My wife and I stayed there for 6 nights. It was very convenient for starting sightseeing because it's nearby the Millennium Park and Grant Park.", 
    "We stayed one night at the Fairmont. I must admit I was a bit disappointed in the quality of the hotel for 4 stars. It was fine - but nothing special. The rooms were a bit noisy - we could hear traffic all night and lots of noise from the hallway. We ordered room service and it took a very long time to get our food. We asked to have a wine bottle opener sent up - since there wasn't one in the room - and it took over an hour to get it. Besides that - it was fine. ", 
    "Our stay at the fairmont was enjoyable. The hotel was clean, the room was quiet and the location was great. Walking distance to the parks and many great food options. We really enjoyed staying here.", 
    "Great hotel and great location. Had a corner room with three windows! Awesome views.", 
    "Hotel staff was not engaging or overtly helpful. Expensive evening when compared to the overall service and friendliness of the front desk.", 
    "Very nice hotel with good location: walk to bus stops, restaurants and Millennium Park. The staff was pleasant and helpful. We loved the fact you can walk under the buildings in the Pedestrian pedway to get to other places without going outside. (AON building)", 
    "Expect to pay for everything, even things you don't get. Our suite had a pull out couch for the kids to sleep on, but no sheets. We called down for some sheets and pillows around 9 PM. The front desk said they would have some sent up. 45 minutes later, a second call, answered by the same person, sounded surprised that we hadn't received anything, but stated that they were \"pretty busy right now\". 30 minutes later I called to cancel the request. We took some sheets from the bed, the bathrobes, and some of the girls stuffed animals to make them comfortable (enough) for the night. Not the type of service I would expect from such a \"quality\" hotel. I will never stay at a Fairmount anywhere ever again.", 
    "close to everything. Lake, millennium park, best restaurants. Beautiful room!", 
    "Very pleasant. Nice room, nice hotel appearance. Central location. Overall awesome. ", 
    "Very good hotel in a prime location. Great privacy and professional staff. But be very careful with your directions to this hotel. If you are driving with your GPS, please be informed that for security reasons, the GPS signals are scrambled to 1 1/2 blocks. Write the down the directions from the mapping software of your choice as you enter the downtown area. I could see the building and struggled to navigate to it eventhough I have significant driving experience in NY, San Fran, and Boston downtowns. The other reason is there are multiple layers of traffic which could confuse you. I had to take one u-turn in the wrong location (safe though) to reach this hotel. The hotel did NOTHING to help me TIPS. If you manage to get there they will take care of it. The vallet parking worked perfectly. No issues.", 
    "great accomadations,friendly courteous staff and convenient central location in South Streeterville.Room was spacious and immaculate. Would highly recommend. Hope to be back next time on business.", 
    "We were in Chicago for a 2 night stay and the Fairmont was perfectly placed for us. It is close to all of the attractions and numerous L stations. The beds were super comfortable and the room was a fantastic size for the 2 of us. Would definitely stay there again. ", 
    "Loved it. Only complaint was a surging water pressure in shower. Was on 36 floor so that might explain why", 
    "We loved the central downtown location for our sight seeing vacation. The staff was helpful pleasant and completely accommodating! The valet parking worked well for us when staying in Chicago or visiting family just outside Chicago. The food in the restaurant and room service were very good. The room was clean comfortable and the layout worked well especially with 4 adults. The separate water closet (toilet) and big closet gave the extra space we needed. The shower water pressure could have been better and the beds could have been bigger though both worked well for us during our stay. ", 
    "Overall our stay was very satisfactory. It was, however, very disappointing that our room was available at the regular check-in time. We arrived around 12:00 PM and our room was not available until 5:00 PM. We were in town for a bachelorette party and ended up having to order dinner in our room instead of going out so everyone had time to get cleaned up and ready for the evening.", 
    "The Fairmont was great. It was a good location and the staff was very nice.", 
    "Very nice hotel, no complaints!", 
    "First time to Chicago and boy did I pick a good hotel!!!! I can't think of anything negative to say! It was very convenient and 2 min from Millennium park! Just an awesome trip-oh Engine 13is rightacross the street", 
    "Great location, and clean!", 
    "Walking across bridge at Wacker to so many sites and restaurants . Parking at Prudential Plaza with great ease! Rooms and Facility a true get away!", 
    "The Fairmont Hotel is a pretty nice hotel. The location was great for us, within walking distance to the Millenium Park train station, as well as Navy Pier and other sites we were looking to visit during our stay. I gave 4 stars only because there was an upcharge for everything you expect a hotel to supply for you. There was even an upcharge if you wanted a refrigerator, and to drink the coffee that is generally supplied in hotel rooms. I suppose its a way to keep the cost of the room down, but it just seemed a little silly. All in all, we had an enjoyable stay at Fairmont, though it wasn't enough to bring us back for future stays.", 
    "My husband and I stayed for four nights in April. We had a great view of the lake from our room. The hotel was clean and well-maintained. It's in a great location--we flew in and didn't rent a car, and we found it easy to talk or take transit everywhere we wanted to go. We would definitely stay again.", 
    "Close to Millennium Park, Soldier Field and many other tourist sites. Good price for a very nice hotel", 
    "Our room was comfortable enough and the staff was friendly, but it seems dated compared to other hotels we've stayed in recently, particularly for the price!", 
    "The staff was not very helpful and to be honest quite rude. I had an upgrade certificate that they would not honor and put me in probably the worst room they could find with 2 double beds...I called to request a king since I am 6'4\". I will not be going back to this hotel.", 
    "Very polite, friendly staff. The rooms are 5 star! I'll be returning back here next time I'm in Chicago.", 
    "Staff was incredibly helpful and prompt with all requests. Concierge offered great dining recommendations and took care of all reservations. Room was simple and elegant. Couldn't have asked for more, especially for the price in downtown Chicago.", 
    "Deal booked on Expedia for flight and hotel combined. Nice hotel, excellent location, very friendly and helpful staff. Clean room, decent view from the 29th floor. For the price they charge nothing is included, just the basics. No free Internet, no free WiFi, mini-bar extra (alcohol expected), expensive parking @ $65/day, however including in & out privileges. Room a bit dated but comfortable. Overall a pleasant experience, I would return with no hesitation and recommend Fairmont to anyone visiting Chicago. ", 
    "Great location, excellent customer service. Clean room. ", 
    "We had a great one night experience. We arrived early and there was a room available for us! Excited to freshen up before a day at Wrigley Field!", 
    "A/C filter hadn't been changed in so long that the dusk had clogged the A/C unit itself. Not a problem unless you like cold air or have a dust allergy. VIP room does not include luxury suites (unless they are on floors 15-18). For $450 bucks a night you would think I could get a \"free\" cup of coffee and a croissant. Also, add $5 to the price of the room, but DO NOT charge me to log on to your wi-fi. It's like charging to use the color on the TV. Being nickled and diming is NOT how I like to spend weekends away. Such great potential, just not quite there.", 
    "The room was in need of repair, the tub dripped constantly, grout was missing all over the tile, paint pealing on several walls, and the room was next to the elevator so we listened to every guest come and go!. Do not order water without looking at the price! $18.00! Food is not as described and if you have a restricted diet; don't eat at the restraint in the hotel!", 
    "The hotel is located close to the parks, and museums, but leaves a lot to be desired. The lobby is nice, but the rooms are not that clean, and are not well equipped. Are room only had 3 drawers for our clothes, and the toilet was dirty upon check in. When we called to have it cleaned, the manager told us that the staff was eating and they will get to it after their break, not the answer I expected. There are too many nicer hotels in the area, so I will never stay there again.", 
    "This was a perfect central location to everything we wanted to do/see while in Chicago. It was within a 2 mile walk to Navy Pier, FirstMerit Bank Pavilion, Millennium Park/Grant Park, and lots of a great restaurants. There are always cabs waiting when needed, and it was only about a $10 cab ride from where the MegaBus drops you off downtown. We will be staying here again! The only problem we had was our air conditioner did not work in our room even after calling twice to have it repaired.", 
    "My husband and I had a wonderful stay at the Fairmont Chicago at Millennium Park the weekend of the 4th of July. Upon arriving the Bellman so attentively approached us for our bags. The front desk check in was extremely hassle free and very accommodating. All of my special requests were granted (a nice view and high up). We were on the 25 floor and the view was great. The room was pretty large and the comfort of the room was great. We will definitely return for our annual visit to Chicago. We loved our stay at the Fairmont Chicago, and highly recommend staying there. Oh.. and the sushi in the Aria lounge was simply delicious! Our stay was lovely.", 
    "I was able to check in earlier than expected. The room was exceptional. It was close enough to Navy Pier so I could walk there and back to enjoy the 4th of July festivities. ", 
    "The Fairmont's location was perfect for what I wanted to do in Chicago. I was able to walk to Navy Pier, the museums, aquarium, planetarium, and the parks.", 
    "Had a great time at the Fairmont - some confusion at check-in but overall and excellent hotel and location! ", 
    "Over the years we have stayed at the Fairmont 14-15 times. When you can get a good rate it is the best bargain in Chicago.", 
    "I like the Fairmont. Nice room layout with dressing area off of the bathroom. Everything might need a fresh coat of paint and a little steam cleaning. Love the soap line they carry. Hotel coffee should be free though! And so should wi-fi!", 
    "Nice hotel with great location. Restaurant is very expensive, even for breakfast. Towels could be a little better quality for the price.", 
    "We had never stayed at this Fairmont before and were extremely impressed with how beautifully appointed our room was. This was perhaps one of the most comfortable and nicest rooms we have rented in all of our travels, and we travel quite extensively. Moreover, the staff was very courteous and helpful. We would definitely stay in this hotel again when coming to Chicago.", 
    "I was disappointed that there was an upcharge for almost every amenity -- even water. The hotel, however is convenient and the rooms are well appointed and comfortable.", 
    "The Fairmont is a good group hotel but expensive for the level of guest experience. It is large and very impersonal. If you are looking for a more personal experience, there are many more interesting hotels in Chicago that can be easily explored on line.", 
    "Pleasant & comfortable!", 
    "The Fairmont was the PERFECT location for us to enjoy a Chicago weekend! Walking distance to everything we wanted to do! We parked our car at a nearby garage and didn't pick it up until the weekend was over. (it's cheaper to not valet park it if you aren't going to need a car during your stay) The bathroom was an extra bonus as it was unlike most hotel bathroom layouts. Their is a separate shower from the bathtub and the toilet area was separate with it's own door which allowed for extra privacy when people were getting ready at the same time. We also liked the area just outside the bathroom with a mirror and extra space to get ready. We will definitely return to the Fairmont anytime we are in Chicago!", 
    "Upscale hotel, so pricey, but rooms and bathrooms are comfortable and clean and felt luxurious. Was on 32nd floor, but elevators came quickly. Walking distance to Millenium Park was nice. Sushi bar downstairs was fresh. My television wasn't working, and they sent someone up very quickly to resolve the issue. It was a reasonable option considering I booked late.", 
    "A perfectly reasonable place - clean, quiet, etc. It just feels a bit dated (we had a King room). The bathroom doors are massively heavy pocket doors, furniture is very bulky (more like office furniture) and our sheets had a big hole in them on the seam. Place was functional - all worked, people were nice etc, but we got room for our 10th anniversary and there was nothing special about this, but nothing horribly wrong.", 
    "Everything was great. Would stay again.", 
    "Really lovely hotel, short walk to Navy Pier, shops on Michigan Ave, Millenium Park and lots of restaurants. We had a great view of the lake with large windows to enjoy the view. They only complaint I would have was our queens bed more like Full-size mattresses. It was a little cramped for my husband and I. ", 
    "Very nice large hotel, if you are there for shopping trip it's not in a convient location to walk. ", 
    "Excellent beds and pillows a beautiful bathroom and top rate service all located 2 blocks from Millenium Park and the the river. We will definitely be back.", 
    "Mediocre facilities. Great locations though, probably it's best selling point. Staff at the front desk can come off as a bit rude and cold sometimes.", 
    "We had a great 5 night stay here!! Only thing was they didn't change the linens each night, only once in our 5 night stay! But hotel staff was amazing and hotel was wonderful! We would stay again for sure!", 
    "Poor food & Waite staff", 
    "We were treated well by staff; very polite and attentive. The room was great. The location, being near the Chicago river downtown was very convenient for the parks and the magnificent mile/nightspots. A great place to stay when visiting Chicago for a quick get away.", 
    "Beds were wonderful and pillows galore. Marble shower and housecoats amazing. I travel a bit and enjoyed this hotel; its \"extras\" that were part of the price and friendly informative staff. Close to tours, parks and a", 
    "I stayed at the fairmont without knowing much about the Chicago area. It was in a great spot to walk for food and most tourist attractions. I was also able to rent bikes less than a block away at millennium park (home to the bean and art institute of Chicago). Altogether it was a great stay in a beautiful hotel for a good price!", 
    "I really enjoyed my stay, only downside: doors in the bathroom were difficult to shut.", 
    "The hotel was nice enough - certain fine details were missed in the cleaning (dust had built up to an excessive amount behind the thermostat, etc.) while the details were piddly, for a fairly expensive room, I expected better. The shower was fantastic, as was the staff, so I cant complain overmuch. Requested a king bed, but didnt get it. This is the risk you take with an expedia booking of course, and the staff tried to make it right with an upgraded corner room, so i'll give a push there. Basically, nothing blew me away, but nothing really disgusted me either. For the money, would likely stay elsewhere, unless location was important.", 
    "Don't stay here if you have kids. The food service, which of course is expensive, does not have an appropriate kids menu. Also, there's no pool. The \"spa\" is not kid-friendly. The hotel staff will direct you to go over to the adjacent Fairmont Condos to \"use the pool their.\" Guess what? No kids below age 18 allowed during the M-F week. And a \"day pass\" to the facilities is $35!!! Basically, you better just park your kids in front of the TV--Movies are $8.00. Yawn!!!!", 
    "Rooms were comfortable, clean and quiet. One of the best hotel experiences I've had in downtown Chicago. The gym was decent for a hotel. Location is okay but a little removed from the buzz of the city.", 
    "hard to find and get to. room very nice and quiet.", 
    "Since this was our first time in Chicago, we didn't know what to expect. From the minute we stepped into the hotel, we knew instantly that our weekend was going to be a real treat. The hotel was top notch and our room \"fabulous.\" The view from our room window on the 28th floor was breathtaking. We visually experienced the lakeshore for miles. Couldn't get enough of the view~Awesome. The staff was extremely accommodating and helpful. They assisted with dinner reservations, directions, and suggestions on how to get around the downtown area. They made our first-time trip to Chicago a memorial event."

  "talbott": [
    "The Talbot is a great boutique hotel that has that wonderful old-time atmosphere. It is off Michigan Ave. just enough to be in a quiet, relaxed area. But it is close to great shopping. The bar is a pleasant place to unwind. Our room was large and comfortable. The water pressure in the shower (on the 16th floor) could have been better, but that was our only complaint.", 
    "The evening crew at the front desk and in he small dining room/ bar were rude, arguementative, and could have cared less in even trying to meet our needs after a late arrival by train. We ended up going across the street for service. The doorman, bell staff and others were nice, but when the night \"managers\" were of such poor quality, we will not return to this hotel.", 
    "I misunderstood that contenintal breakfast was not free. Only one elevator was working. Hard to get up or down.", 
    "Great location. This felt like a small British hotel. All the people were very helpful and cheerful. We missed the Brownies but apparently they serve them between 7 and 9 and they are said to be wonderful!", 
    "Wonderful accomodations, with a very helpful concierge. Lobby and restaurant were cozy and the food was delicious.", 
    "This is a cozy charming little hotel. If you are in Chicago for power shop along Mag Mile and Oak street, the location of this hotel is great. The room is generous size. If you are light sleeper, like I am, might bother you hearing the noise -elevator motor noise? - I killed that noise by turn on the a/c.", 
    "This was our first time in Chicago and our first time staying in a Talbot hotel. The only reason I rated our overall experience a 4 instead of a 5 was due to the lack-luster wait staff in the hotel restaurant. We had dinner and a breakfast their and both times our waitress (2 different people) were horribly slow and inattentive. However, the food at the restaurant was reasonably priced and excellent. The room was clean and comfortable and the hotel staff was exceptional. I highly recommend this hotel.", 
    "Very nice rooms..very spacious...great staff", 
    "Good location and very pleasant accomodations.", 
    "Disclaimer: We usually wouldn't stay at this class of hotel and are more used to a rather more 'down to earth' experience. That said, we thoroughly enjoyed this hotel. Very clean, very friendly and just far enough off Michigan avenue to be comfortable. Basil's bar/cafe served some good food whilst being an accomodating bar with helpful staff. Did not try their in room breakfast as it didn't appeal greatly, but it seemed standard sort of fare from when we have (fairly rarely) stayed in similar accomodation. I wish hotels would branch out from (badly) standardised forms for such things but I guess it keeps it simple for them. Overall a great experience. The friendly staff really made the trip and I would certainly stay there again.", 
    "A first class hotel. The staff was wonderful and the accomodations were supurb. I doubt that the Four Seasons a block away could be any better. The location is perfect for exploring Chicago. Our upgraded room was very spacious and tastefully designed with old world class and charm. The bathroom was huge and featured a large marble tiled showed and jacuzzi tub. Outstanding.", 
    "A good place to stay but seemed more like what I would consider a 3 star hotel.", 
    "We liked the hotel very much in all respects. We were lucky to have a very comfortable suite, but a standard bedroom would also have been good. The location is very convenient: very close to the \"Magnificent Mile\", and a half hour walk to the Loop area.", 
    "Elegant old world style", 
    "Great beds with down pillows. Very comfortable room that is faily spacious for Chicago hotels. Great for a one to two night stay in the city.", 
    "We really liked the location of this hotel, just off the beaten path in Downtown Chicago. Small, but intimate hotel.", 
    "I am a picky person and one who like service when it should be their and it was. I do not have any complaints. I would stay thier again. The food downstairs in the bar/restaurant was the best filet migoen I have had. Expensive but well worth it. They even offer a late check out of 2 pm, that was great. We ordered room service we both got the same burger and fries and it was excellent and worth the money as well. A huge tastey burger and seasoned fries. One possible issue is the noise from the hallway and or utility room. You can hear noises via the air vent. Like I mentioned before I am a picky person and the noises that I did hear from the hallway were not an issue. The blinds are pull down via string. Their are no big heavy curtains to cover the windows. I like my room pitch black when sleeping and it wasn't too bad. Hope this info helps.", 
    "Very clean, medium sized hotel. Employees are very helpful. I booked my parents and other relatives here for their anniversary and everyone was very accommodating with room requests, etc... Perfect location just off of N. Michigan Ave. near Rush restuarants, Hancock Bldg, etc... My parents have now stayed here twice while visiting Chicago and will stay nowhere else.", 
    "While not top class, a very nice small hotel in a gtreat location. If you're looking for someplace with a reasonable price and don't need five star amenities, but like nice, clean and upscale then this is for you.", 
    "Located within walking distance to most necessary things. Service desk and concierge especially good. Housekeeping staff friendly and consumer-satisfaction oriented. Decor in lobby, cafe, and room nice and appealing Thumbs up to all involved!", 
    "My wife and I live in Chicago and wanted to have a night away. We decided to stay at this hotel since we had walked past it many times and noticed the al fresco diners, turn of the century architecture and great location. I'm glad we selected the Talbot over the newer 'glass, concrete, and steel' hotels. The bar is very nice place to start your evening. The beautiful wood paneled lobby is a great place to begin your morning with a fireside cup of coffee and newspaper. We highly recommend it.", 
    "My wife and I shared a suite with our two children (13 and 14 yo). Although the sitting area had an uncomfortable sofa-bed, the management moved us to another room and supplied firm comfortable first-class \"cots\" for the kids. The concierge staff was outstanding, very hard-working, sincerely interested in our satisfaction. All hotel staff were helpful. Although they don't have a in-hotel spa or workout facility, they have a complementary arrangement with a nearby full-service gym/spa. We like the convenience of being about two blocks from Michigan Ave and Hancock Bld/Water Tower.", 
    "Talbott offers a very gratifying and satisfying stay. what will stand out is the warmth and personable nature of the staff including the concierge, the front desk and just about everybody who works there. It is pricy, then again Chicago downtown is pricy. but its situated close to several places that you can walk to for good food, pursuing the arts, dancing, music etc.", 
    "On a business/leisure trip, I fell in love with the 'old world' looking charm -- and many stars -- of this small hotel. On arrival, the doorman, bellman, receptionist and concierge were all lovely and cheerful. Up the elevator, out to a narrow unpleasant corridor to our room -- we were first sent to an occupied room, apologies, up another flight to a roomy corner space. But it turns out the hotel has no air circulation system: an AC for the summer in the wall; for air the rest of the year: OPEN THE WINDOW ON EAST DELAWARE AND LISTEN TO THE TRAFFIC ALL NIGHT! No business center, no fax, no internet service, and when I called to see if I could get a toothbrush, the night manager told me to go across the street to the drugstore! His attitude was sort of \"my way or the highway\".Fortunately, Expedia got us re-booked to a real 4 star hotel, the Palmer House, the next AM, same price, actually even less, with great service AND amenities as well as friendly people.", 
    "Very good", 
    "We loved staying here. We checked in 2 hours after check in time (at 5 pm) on a Saturday and our requested room was already filled. The staff upgraded us to a nicer, larger room at no cost. They were very accomodating!"

    "Disappointing. Dire need of renovation! I wouldn't recommend this venue.", 
    "I stay in Hilton Chicago with family,it's very good hotel for family and they make us very comfortable particularly the lounge we enjoyed it a lot", 
    "Nice hotel in Chicago, great location. Great staff who were very friendly and polite. ", 
    "The hotel is overall good. However the front desk registration didn't look very well trained and didn't provide sufficient service during the check-in. No refrigerator in the room. Room service didn't replace the some towels etc.", 
    "Rooms are too small and need to newer furniture. Bathrooms need new tile, looks very old. Beds are great. Really comfortable.", 
    "It is a huge busy place, well run, with a few glitches here and then.Not all rooms \"created equal\" though, some are much better than others. I complained about my room (noisy due to proximity to the service elevator, severe air blow from the air conditioner way too powerful for a small room) and got new one, much better, for the same price.", 
    "Arrived on a Thursday and departed on a Saturday. Steff was friendly and we enjoyed our visit to the Windy City!", 
    "Hotel is begining to show its age, elevators are wobbly, and the bathroom need exhaust fans internet is not free", 
    "Our stay was very nice, self parking was not hard , you don't need your car. Hotel is close to everything,take the bus, ride a bike or cabs were always out front. Staff was helpful when asked about their great city from where to eat or where to skip! This was our first time in Chicago and we would come back here again. Room was small, but you have so many things to do, room was just a place to have a good night sleep. Thanks for making our trip hassle free.", 
    "Looking for an overnight hotel in the downtown area. Big place.", 
    "Great location, hotel has a lot of history. Staff friendly, housekeeping did more than we asked one day and less the next. Other than that good experience.", 
    "The location of the hotel was great but the service was very slow. My heat did not work in my room. I had to call the front desk three times before they fixed the problem. I was freezing for about an hour.", 
    "The hotel was nice, but the rooms were average. The beds were extremely small, there was a space for a fridge but you had to rent one for $40/night, and as with everywhere in Chicago the price for parking is ridiculous. Nice location in terms of proximity to Millenium Park, Michigan Ave, and other places of interest, but overall somewhat disappointed for the cost. The staff was quick to get me checked in and address things needed, but weren't overly friendly or welcoming. ", 
    "Everything was great. The people we dealt with did a good job. Location down town is close to everything.", 
    "Everything was good about hotel. Only problem was AC did not work in our room. ", 
    "My room was the old outdated room.. Hair was in shower and had to be moved.", 
    "We had a great view of Lake Michigan! The hotel was beautiful, staff was very nice, and the location is great if you would like to visit the museums. Restaurants in the area are ethnic food- however a nice breakfast restaurant called \"yolk\" is close. We had two young children and they had fun here. ", 
    "We stayed three nights over spring break with our school aged daughters. There were many attractions and restaurants near the hotel. The staff was very helpful and friendly. The room was clean, roomy, and attractive. HOWEVER, they nickel and dime you to death for amenities. I can't believe they would charge you for simple things like a refrigerator, access to the pool, or wifi. Seriously? An up charge for wifi in this day and age? Additionally, there wasn't a microwave to be found to be anywhere. So, whatever you do, don't plan on bringing any leftovers back to the room that requiring heating up. ", 
    "Does it need updating- yes. But for the price, service, staff, and location...I can deal.", 
    "My 6 year old son and I just got back! Pool and staff were great! Wish the rooms were a little bigger it would be great if the rooms had a microwave. ", 
    "Love the hotel. Staff was exceptional. Will be staying again", 
    "Wifi is $12.95 a day for 1 device or $25 for up to 3. That $25 also gives you pool and fitness center. If you don't pay flat rate of $25 you get charged each day. My $109 Expedia rate turned into $134 a night. Plus the city an state tax was $42. Parking was $55 a DAY. I realize chicago is expensive but my $253.00 total for 2 nights on Expedia turned into $421.96. I would stay here again because our room had 2 bathrooms, it was clean, and convenient. BUT I will park at the self park lot behind hotel for $13.00 a day", 
    "Only thing lacking was refrigerator in the rooms. ", 
    "Staff was friendly, hallways leading to our room had trash, linens and dishes strewn about. Kind of disappointing. Check in was good however, we were asked if we wanted to upgrade to a newly renovated room for $30 more, we declined. We are hilton honors members, so how come if the room was available why didn't we get moved to it with no up charge? I'm assuming that all the rooms rill be upgraded at dome point. ", 
    "A beautiful hotel with great views of both the city and the lake. Easy access to anywhere in Chicago whether it's downtown or in the suburbs. Great if you are on vacation, but I would not recommend this hotel for a business traveler unless your employer would be happy with you paying $12.95 US per day for Wi-Fi in your room. It's free in the lobby but I think that is not acceptable to expect your guests in a hotel of this size and brand to have to go to the lobby. Maybe in 1995 but not in 2015.", 
    "Good hotel but to far from the hot area ( no good restaurants around, you need to pick a taxi ) too big and too old , but with the standard of quality of Hilton", 
    "We had a great time. The hotel was very nice. People were friendly and helpful. Very convenient to get to the many attractions we wanted to see. ", 
    "Hilton's policy of charging separate for WIFI and breakfast reminds me about low cost airlines. I don't think an upscale establishment would want to be associated with low cost airlines but maybe that's just me. My guess is that most people have good data plans, so it would be smarter to jack up the room price by $15 provide free WIFI.", 
    "This is GREAT hotel in a great location. We had a spacious room with a view. Staff was friendly and helpful! Hope to come back soon.", 
    "Stayed at the hotel for a conference. Room was nice, gym was nice. ", 
    "Enjoyed staying at this hotel. Very close to the Museum Campus. A long walk to Magnificent Mile. Had to take the bus back because my kids couldn't walk that far. ", 
    "We didn't get in until 11pm & the special request of 2 beds was just as we had asked. Akoto (bellman) was VERY helpful. He was at the front door & gave us directions to the parking door around back. When I came in the back door he saw me in the lobby & came to help us. He talked with us and my 8 yr old daughter. What really made the stay a gem was that he gave us cards for free breakfast. The breakfast was delicious. (made to order omelets, bacon, sausage lots of fresh fruit, yogurt, very tasty blueberry scones, etc.) The self parking is $55 per day which seems high, but that is the going rate downtown. My daughter wrote a note to our maid telling her that she did a good job. Joanne took the time to leave a note back to my daughter. All in all it was a nice stay in a convenient location. We will definitely consider it again when we come back into town. (In the past we have stayed at Embassy Suites near Navy Pier. The rates are similar, but we had always chosen the Embassy Suites because breakfast is always included.)", 
    "I stayed at the lake view room. You can see the view from your bed in different time, the night lights and the morning sun. The room is very clean and the bed is comfortable. ", 
    "Good Overall value- fairly close to McCormick Used near by parking area and was able to park my car for $25 for the whole weekend !", 
    "My experience was o.k. I expected a larger room with a better view or at least given the choice of views. We were disappointed that the late night room service menu was very scarce. I didn't understand that if room service is available where did they expect me to eat if there was no table and chairs to accommodate me. I was also disappointed in the fact that the housekeeper was knocking at my door at 10am when check out is at 11 am and when asked what the purpose of the knock the answer was, \"oh, I was just seeing if you were still here.\" I didn't care for that at all.. I felt rushed to check out. ", 
    "Pay all that money and you have to pay to park in the hotel parking lot $55 unreal!", 
    "It is a beautiful hotel and we were satisfied with everything but one thing. We went for our anniversary and reserved a king size bed but they gave us two doubles because they did not have any king beds left. It made me a little upset but we still enjoyed our stay. The food was great and so was the service. All of the staff were extremely helpful and very friendly. There was not very amenities, for example, they did not have a fridge so it was hard to save any food from where we ate. The pool area was very clean and well maintained and room service did an outstanding job! Pricing for parking was a little high but had reasonable check out times.", 
    "Mooi, groot en goed onderhouden hotel. Schitterende fitness faciliteiten met sauna en zwembad. Prima ligging met bushalte voor de deur naar magnificent mile (bus 3) en metro om de hoek (red line). Field museum, shedd aquarium en adler op 5 minuten afstand. Schitterend uitzicht op de Willis Tower. ", 
    "My partner and I had a nice experience! The hotel had attentive helpful staff and services, and the room was clean and comfortable. It was a cozy little room with a beautiful granite bathroom and a comfortable clean King sized bed. The hotel itself was very ornate and beautiful! Overall, we had a nice experience staying at this historic hotel. ", 
    "Nice hotel but we aware they charge for everything. Parking is very expensive. ", 
    "The hotel was really cool. Very 1920s feel. All the staff was super nice and helpful. Even got an upgraded room. View wasn't the greatest though. The price for parking was ridiculous. ", 
    "Great location for a getaway with friends!", 
    "Everything was great I just only wish I knew to choose the side of the hotel that I could have a better view of Downtown Chicago, I was only able to see the side of a brick building.", 
    "My boyfriend and I stayed at this hotel for my recent business trip. It was a great place. The room was clean and the bed was super comfortable. We stayed in a room that was not recently remodeled but that was by a bother to us. It was still great! The pool was also great. A nice warm temperature and hot jacuzzis! I liked that there are spots for lap swimming or for fun pool time. And having a jacuzzi for adults only was also a plus! I only buses the track part of the athletic club because I didn't want to pay $15 for the gym equipment but that wasn't a problem bc I enjoy running for my workouts. There were plenty of good places to eat and fun places to go around the hotel as well. I would stay here again!", 
    "Great stay. Took exchange student to Chicago to see the sights. Had a very nice time and hotel staff were very friendly and helpful during our stay. The room with two bathrooms helped greatly with two ladies sharing the room.", 
    "This is a fine old hotel. Certainly not the swankiest nor the most modern but it has been providing, and still is providing, an exceptional value for a very comfortable and convienent stay in Chicago. Excellent customer service. I mark it down from a full 5 to a 4 because of the dining offerings. Chicago is a wonderful food & foodie city and the dining offerings and lounge in the hotel are merely standard hotel food. Rather boring and quite over-priced for their fare. Kitty O'Shea's is better than the others but I would still recommend eating most of your meals elsewhere.", 
    "My husband and I stayed in the hotel for a long weekend.I made a reservation 4 months in advance and asked for 1 big bed for both of us. At the time we checked in they gave us a room with 2 separate single beds. I asked for a change but they said that they didn't have anything else. That was really annoying. The worse part: last day we had to do check out by 11am: at 9am we still in bed and housekeeper start knocking at our door...we ignore her and she came back at 10am to keep knocking. really??? We were out by 10:30am. It wasn't necessary all that. I think it's very disrespectful. I won't go back", 
    "Really enjoyed our stay. Had a couple of small issues but they were quickly remedied by the staff. It was a wonderful stay and we would definitely stay again. Perfect location for Shedd aquarium! Taxi rides to downtown area were $10 on average, which was really reasonable. We also asked the front desk about late check out and we got to stay until 2:00 for an extra $25.", 
    "Front desk gave us incorrect room information so we went up to the room we were given (19th floor) and found that the keys didn't work. Mistakes happen, but this kind of thing is a major drag after traveling. Front desk should have a bit more attention to detail. Room was spacious and comfortable. Furnishings need to be updated, but were otherwise comfortable. Was strange to have two bathrooms in the double room. Hotel staff should play up the hotel's storied past more, it's quite fascinating.", 
    "The hotel itself was nice overall but our room was a lot older than it seemed in pictures. It was clean but the king size room was not as big as I expected either. It wasn't a bad experience, but it just was not as nice as I thought it was going to be.", 
    "Everything was perfect except we weren't aware that parking is an additional cost!!!", 
    "I had paid extra for a room with a view but was told that and access to the pool was an upgrade. Not really that interested but was disappointed that Expedia and Hilton did not have the same info. ", 
    "This is my fourth time staying at the Hilton and I will not stay anywhere else. I love the staff, the rooms, and of course the location! It is nice that we can walk or take a Taxi anywhere from the Hilton. I feel comfortable there. ", 
    "I was suppose to get a room with a lakeside view that I paid extra money for --but when I got there they knew nothing about it --the room was nice & newly remolded --but the heat was on 83 & the thermostat was broken & about to fall off the wall--we were sweating throughout the night even though the temp outside was -10 below zero--beside that the stay was pleasant & quite", 
    "I was unimpressed by this hotel. It was unrefined, crowded, noisy. There is no lobby seating and the staff was not welcoming. Room service was terrible. ", 
    "We got a pretty good deal on the price of the room for Valentine's Day. It was on the 18th floor and overlooked another wall of the hotel. Essentially, it was a view of everyone's hotel room windows. Our room was not really updated. It was pretty well kept, but older. The main floor of the hotel was great though. We enjoyed listening to the jazz singer in the lounge. The building itself, and main lobby was beautiful, and in a good location. ", 
    "Had a good time visiting the attractions, but get to them early to aviod the lines by late morning early afternoon. If your going to vist several get the Chicago pass and save money well worth, I would order it before your trip too. I would avoid the Navy Pier totally in the winter it's brutal. Plan indoor stuff. If you drive I found it better to let my car in the parking at the hotel and take a taxi it's cheaper then driving two miles to the attractions, stressing to find a parking place plus paying if you find open spot. If you a fitness buff either take a break from it or plan on spending extra each day to use the hotel equiptment. A good way to get your fix it to run the staris twenty floors is a good work out. ", 
    "We enjoyed our stay and all the restaurants in and around the hotel", 
    "It was ok they charfed me 110 dollas to park ridiculous hust a greedy place to stay", 
    "Good hotel. Like something from a movie. Very nice very classy place", 
    "Nice romantic getaway spot with an incredible skyline view", 
    "I've never stayed at a hotel with such hard water, we had to pay $110 just to park there for two days, and they put someone else's bar tab on my bill! Won't be staying there again!", 
    "Went for the weekend. Doormen not very nice. Missed a couple small details like no extra blanket in room and no kleenex in one of the bathrooms but overall nice. DO NOT PAY EXTRA FOR WIFI - NOT WORTH IT!!", 
    "Hotel is very clean and comfortable with a choice of four places to eat within the hotel. One is a grab and go type cafe with a great assortment of relatively inexpensive items like instant oatmeal, salads, sandwiches, and sides that can easily be taken back to your room or to your next meeting. I have stayed here many times. Rooms are a good size and many come with two beds and two separate bathrooms. The hotel is older and sometimes there have been minor maintenance items like leaky valves in the bathroom that need repair, but overall the hotel is in very good shape.", 
    "My experience with Expedia was very poor. I booked 2 river view rooms for my girlfriend's birthday. When my party arrived at the hotel check-in we were informed that we do not have river view rooms. We had a view of a brick wall. This was misinformation by the Expedia website. I paid a premium rate to receive upgraded rooms only to find out that my party will be placed in their basic rooms. Such a misinformation is unacceptable. I was not aware that this is how Expedia does business. I surely hope that someone contact me to make amends because I have a very sour taste left in my mouth after this recent experience with Expedia.", 
    "The location of this hotel was ideal for our visit to Soldier Field for college hockey. The hotel was massive but never got lost or had to wait for elevators. The staff was friendly and helpful. The room was clean and not outdated or run down in appearance. My only comment for improvement is in regards to the provided directions from O'Hare via CTA train. The website mentioned the Blue Line from O'Hare to the Jackson stop and then walk 5-6 blocks. We transferred to the Red Line at Jackson to the Harrison stop. This left us only about 2 blocks away. ", 
    "Very beautiful historic hotel in downtown Chicago but the room and amenities were lacking. The room was small and if you wanted a fridge in the room you could call the front desk to have one brought to your room for an extra $40.00! I can't tell you the last time I had to pay extra for a mini fridge in my hotel room. The wifi was also an extra charge... The fixtures in the bathtub were loose so every time I turned the shower on I thought I was going to pull the spout out of the wall. Same goes for the shower head. If you wanted to adjust the angle of the shower it felt like it was going to come lose from the wall as well. With that being said, the staff were nice and the pool was nice but cold. The hotel also had an amazing gym but we chose not to pay the $15.00/day to use it.", 
    "The hotel and staff are some of the best ever in counter by me and my wife. ", 
    "The room was very nice and a nice view of the lake. nice big pool and hot tub. ", 
    "We came to Chicago for the Hockey Winter Classic in Feb. At Soldier field. This hotel was a 10min walk to soldier field, shedd aquarium, the field museum, millennium park. The staff was incredibly friendly & helpful! Also about a 25 min walk to the magnificent mile or there is always a taxi out front. Plus the corner bakery is just around the corner ;) *The only thing I would recommend is bringing your own pillow, theirs aren't very comfy (in my opinion). ", 
    "I was never notified that a package was waiting for me at the front desk....", 
    "Amazing hotel with a perfect location. I traveled to chicago with my friends for the weekend and we loved it. The hotel staff even checked us in earlier since we arrived early morning. Would recommend to anyone ", 
    "The location is great, right on Michigan Ave. overall the hotel has stayed up to date, with a few things still needing renovation. It was unpleasant that my TV could not show regular programming at all and was too far/ too small for where the bed was.", 
    "A couple details caused us to be disappointed in this hotel. We stayed for three nights. On day 2, we had no bathmat and no glasses after housekeeping completed the room cleaning for the day. The room itself was quite small and appointments (lamps, window dressings, bathroom fixtures, etc.) are dated and dreary. Food available at the restaurant for quick grabs in the morning and for lunch between meetings was so-so. Pluses...we love the location and staff are friendly and helpful. Interestingly, colleagues attending the same meeting and staying in the same hotel commented favorably on their rooms...Did we get a \"leftover\" because we booked with Hotels.com?", 
    "Always have a good experience at the Hilton. Love the remodeling.", 
    "We really enjoyed our stay. The pool and hot tubs were nice. The location was great. A few minutes walk to Aquarium, Planetarium, Soldier Field and Field Museum. We were tired at the end of the day so we ate at the hotel restaurant 720 South Grill. It was the nicest meal we had in Chicago (and that is really saying something!) Go. Enjoy.", 
    "Stayed at this hotel specifically because it was close to Buddy Guy's Legends. Location is excellent. Hotel amenities are excellent. Only issue was that we were on floor 21 and awoken at 9am to the sound of jackhammering on the floor directly above us. None of this was disclosed at the time of booking a room, or when we were assigned a room at checkin. The staff informed us that they are doing a 'complete renovation' which sounds like more jackhammering is to come. I'd stay here again, but please confirm that you are on a floor far from the one being renovated. Also, if I owned a hotel, I'd probably jackhammer say from noon till 8pm, so as not to disturb those patrons who go to sleep early for conferences, or those who plan to sleep in late because they were out on the town.", 
    "The room was clean except for a stain on the comforter. It had been washed but was still visible and that put me off a little.", 
    "Lovely, old fashioned hotel with modern conveniences. We traveled to Chicago for my husband's 50th birthday, and we were treated so nicely here. Rooms are spacious, tasteful, and well cared for. Staff, especially George at the front desk, were very accommodating.", 
    "Super convenient stay. Hotel is huge and very nice. Rooms could use a little updating. I was so thirsty late at night but there was no mini bar. Our room was on a corner and had 2 bathrooms! Super nice staff. Would stay again.", 
    "great location - right next to Legends", 
    "Overall, this was a great place to stay. The location was wonderful, we had a package that included parking, and the room had two bathrooms, which was awesome for a girls' weekend. That said, no one told us there was massive remodeling going on adjacent to our floor from 8 am-4pm on weekdays, which made for a rude awakening the last day (Monday) of our trip. In addition, hotels.com lists check-out at noon, but the hotel changed it to 11:00. They were nice about it and didn't charge us after we went down to registration because our card had been deactivated at 11, but it was an odd mix up. Our floor was a little dated, but still nice--the renovations look pretty awesome, so I'd definitely go back--I'd just make sure I asked for a room nowhere near the construction, and would verify check out times etc.", 
    "Everything was great", 
    "very nice hotel, good located, clean. close to everything.", 
    "Wonderful stay. Friendly staff, great service and loved the location. Can't beat it with a stick. I highly recommend.", 
    "We decided to stay here since it was so close to the museums and we were not disappointed! Everyone was friendly, professional and helpful and the room was clean and comfortable. We won't hesitate to stay here again!", 
    "great stay and Buddy Guys is just out the back door", 
    "The room we were in had a great view of Grand Park and was only walking distance from the subway. However, we found an old muffin in one of the drawers which we quickly through out! Other than that we had a very pleasant stay with taxis available at your door step for when you need to catch a red eye flight! ", 
    "The hotel was accommodating with the lake view even though they stated that what I had purchased on expedia was not available as a room. They asked to see the confirmation and then switched the assigned room to a lake view since I had paid extra for the lake view. Much appreciated.", 
    "Great stay. Beautiful hotel. Friendly staff. Perfect accommodations and a good price. ", 
    "Wonderful shopping nearby. Ice skating by the bean was great. All within easy walking and bus ride.", 
    "The only thing that was bad about the hotel was the beds, there is no way that that was a queen size bed but everything else was awesome and will be back on my next trip to Chicago", 
    "Easy access in & out of the city. Walking distance to everything we wanted to do .. Millinium Park, Michigan Ave Shopping, Navy Pier. Best Pizza in town is 1 block away .. Lou Malnatis.", 
    "Great hotel! Right in the heart of downtown Chicago. Had no complaints, and was very happy with the cleanliness of the room :) Also a very pretty and historic hotel!", 
    "This hotel was great! Rooms were clean. Great views of the city. Pool was clean and warm. ", 
    "We love this hotel based on its location, restaurant, fitness facility and overall relaxing atmosphere. We go to Chicago for races and triathlons, so we have enough stress going on in our trip that our hotel needs to be top notch. The Hilton does not disappoint!", 
    "It was a above average hitel. Although this hotel may not be chicagi's most modern hotel. It's historic importance gives it a vibe that any history buff or tourist who enjoys a old fashioned experience would enjoy but an experience that is 4 stars with all the modern amenities that the mist discoursing hotel guest requires.", 
    "I brought my daughter and her friend to Chicago for her birthday celebration. It was a great trip.", 
    "the hotel was very crowded. When I got there I was rushed to my room. I was very dissatisfied with my room, as it was tiny and my window was actually facing the roof of a lower side of the hotel with the AC units. I have called and asked to be moved, as this is not what I have paid for. I was told the hotel is full and they will see what they can do about it, but there was no follow up. The atmosphere in the hotel was manic; I was never told where breakfast was served and the staff was not very nice - very impersonal, rushed every costumer; trying to get reception on the phone was a hassle as nobody answered (i was on hold for more than 10 min).", 
    "very bad service & room not cleaned properly. Heater was not working so it was cold.", 
    "Heater was not working in the room so it was very cold, became sick..Room they don't clean properly, was very bad & dirty. Service was very bad..", 
    "To be honest, had to show my kids what a 5 star hotel was like and we got great rates for the rooms themselves the week between Xmas and New Year ($85 per night). Not really my style -- $69 per day parking plus $24 eggs for breakfast. Something to do once in a lifetime but anyone with an ounce of frugality will find it painful to stay here. On the positive side, within walking distance of the aquarium and Field Museum.", 
    "comincia a sentire il peso degli anni,molte camere sono tristi e vecchie,per soggiornare nelle ristrutturate bisogna pagare le tariffe non di prima fascia. ristoranti tristi e vecchi idem il bar.non proprio centrale", 
    "Overall my stay at the hotel was very nice. I was given a modern room, which was very quiet. However, I thought at first it did not include an in-room coffeemaker or hairdryer. In fact, both were hidden away (coffeemaker in a pull-down panel beneath the TV, and the hair dryer in a knapsack hanging on the back of the bathroom door). It would have been nice to have that mentioned at check-in. I was a little confused by Kitty O'Sheas being closed the night of my visit. I had dinner in the lounge then, and it was quite pleasant - the food delicious and very good service. The food in the deli seemed quite overpriced though, for example $7.50 for a fancy yogurt cup. I chose this hotel in large part for its proximity to the Art Institute, a short walk of five blocks. I would definitely stay there again.", 
    "I loved everything about this hotel. It was at a great location, the price was awesome, and it had two bathrooms for us that we're sharing room with friends! Staff was very nice and it had a great gym and fitness center. Would stay here again", 
    "I had a great stay at the Hilton! It was my birthday so the Reservationist upgraded my room to Business Class and it had a Lake Michigan view! She also gave me 2 complimentary Sunday Brunch passes which served Excellent food! I had seen Buddy Guy at Legends on Saturday night which is less than a block away from the hotel. I know where I'm spending next year's Birthday!", 
    "Nice hotel. Location was convenient for museums and other attractions, not so much for shopping. Would stay here again", 
    "Great rooms and facilities. Can't wait to go back again. BTW there is a liquor store/bar right behind the hotel open till 4:00 AM just in case you want late night munchies or shots ;-)", 
    "Comfortable room, loved having two bathrooms with the wife and I and two kids in one room. Would like to have free wifi in the room though.", 
    "appretiated the large bathroom", 
    "Clean Hotel, very close to the museums and the Shedd. The staff was very courteous.", 
    "Parking was $55 per night (without the valet service)! There was no fridge in the room, the surfaces were not wiped, there was mold on the lid of the ice bucket.", 
    "The shower would not stay compressed or on... The handle was very loose.", 
    "Excellent stay as usual.", 
    "The hotel was good. The only issue we had was with the 2 double beds in our room. We had 4 people in the room and 2 people don't fit on a double bed.", 
    "The hotel was very nice for the price but the rooms were different then the pictures when we got there", 
    "Hotel was beautiful and very close to the train that we took to get there. Staff was very friendly and helpful to answer all of our questions. After the room had been cleaned, some things were not replaced (coffee supplies, towels, soap, etc.) but other than that it was a perfect stay.", 
    "Grand ol' hotel with courteous staff. Ridiculously slow elevators, but everything else was top notch. A brisk walk away from Soldier Field, too.", 
    "We all really enjoyed the hotel a lot. It was gorgeous. The only complaint would be lack of free wifi, Q-tips and robes in the room. Our bed was SO comfortable as were the pillows. Would definitely recommend.", 
    "The hotel is certainly older. They are renovating many areas and the staff was very helpful and kind. I love the old hotel even if you are not having an event you must check out the the Grand Ballroom!", 
    "The hotel is awesome, well located.", 
    "Candace, front desk mgr was awesome! She treated us very well when we discovered our van would not fit in the self serv parking garage. Hotel is steeped in history, location is perfect for all the museums, theatre, millennium park, & shopping. We'll be back!", 
    "We are very pleased we chose the Hilton for our Chicago visit. The location was perfect for shopping and seeing the city. We were there just before the Christmas holiday and the hotel was absolutely beautiful. It was a busy weekend, a Bears game Monday night during our stay and the hotel was bustling yet still attentive to us as guests. We were provided great service when we dined at the restaurant and snack shop. The bar keep was attentive and knowledgeable of the menu when and had a couple night caps and snack at the pub. Our first evening at the hotel we brushed up on sites with the bar keep who also knew the city and had a nice conversation about Primer League Soccer. I look forward to staying here on our next trip and have already recommended it to friends and family.", 
    "We stayed for 3 nights and all 3 nights were very enjoyable! The hotel was very clean, the front desk was quick and efficient and the rooms were great! Check in was quick and the staff was really nice! Our reservation was saved and they offered any changes we might need without problem. We upgraded to get WiFi and the athletic club, which was a great choice! THe athletic club has a ton of weight machines, cardio options and free weights.. the athletic club was WAY too warm, but that was the only negative. The rooms were very clean and the hotel was always in good condition. The staff was very nice also! Negatives- the thermostat in our room was broken and it took 5 hours for someone to come replace the batteries. The staff was nice when they arrived, but it was 11:30pm when they finally got there.", 
    "First, the good: The Hilton is beautiful on the outside and the lobby is stunning. Parking was pretty easy in their ramp, and checking in went well and the woman at the desk was very friendly. Our room was very nice, considering the age of the hotel, and we were surprised it had two bathrooms. Now, the bad: Our room was very nice, but not clean--we saw a layer of dust under the entertainment center and wouldn't let our infant play on the floor at all since it pretty clearly hadn't been vacuumed well. Next, we had my mom stay in the next room to watch the baby while we caught a game in town--unfortunately, in her room both the TV and telephone didn't work. Helping to seal the deal that this isn't the best hotel in Chicago is that as I checked out in person (since you can't check out by phone when your phone doesn't work) and told the woman at the desk the phone didn't work, there was no apology or mention of being sure to get that taken care of. While first impressions are important and ours was good, last impressions are also a big deal as we left with a disappointing checkout.", 
    "Awesome upscale hotel. Service was excellent and I will definitely stay at this hotel again.", 
    "Wonderful weekend stay. The staff was so helpful and nice. The kids loved the pool and that it stayed open until 10:00 pm.", 
    "Overall, the hotel is nice and the lobby is a must see even if you're not staying. The rooms need remodeling. The decor is definitely from the early 80s. The bathroom and fixtures were old and very worn. The bottom sheet on the bed didn't extend the full length of the bed, which I found very odd. Not sure if they used a queen sheet on a king bed or...? The staff was friendly and helpful, except for the concierge. Apparently we annoyed her Highness by asking a question and her response was rather curt. Also, if you drive, they charge $50/day for parking.", 
    "Staff unfriendly. Vouchers becos of services not available does not suite guest especially if early check out. Made arrangements with Dough the manager to change vouchers due to early check out, all was agreed and guess what? Get to reception and only 1 voucher for $ 25, when this was a swop for 5 guest who had each had $15 vouchers. I would not suggest booking exec rooms until renovations completed or never at all. Back home in South Africa the service is 100 times better", 
    "Very nice, but crowded during the holidays. Front desk staff very friendly. Great rate and included self-parking.", 
    "Comfortable place except for public transportation access", 
    "Fit our needs and was a lot of fun. We enjoyed the stay and will look forward to staying there again", 
    "My daughter and I came for Christmas and had a very enjoyable stay, it's also nice you are pet friendly!!!! Everyone was very pleasant and sociable, the food was excellent. I would definetly stay again!!!", 
    "Very nice hotel. But felt like we were nickel and dimed. Everything cost extra from $52.00 per night to $15.95 per day for wifi. Very noisy hallway...not the hotels fault just a bunch of party goers.", 
    "Nice hotel, needs free breakfast. I will definitely recommend this hotel or stay again. Is close to shopping and parks. ", 
    "Awesome! I only don't get why expedia wants me to write more. Ratings and spontaneous reviews should do the work.", 
    "I enjoy my stay at the hotel great spot and location right across from Grant Park. My room over look Michigan Ave and Lake Michigan. I didn't find the internet service user friendly in the room at all,you have to pay for WiFi services. I think internet service should have been included in the stay. It really doesn't cost the hotel any more money to allow \"free\" access to Wifi services. I was checking for things to do in the area just turn it up.:-(", 
    "Let me start with saying I am a Hilton Honors gold member. My husband and I always stay at Hilton properties. This was, by far, the worst hotel I have ever stayed in. It took us 30 minutes to check-in because 3 front desk attendants were chatting each other up instead of working through the check-in line. We booked the Lakeview King room, but they bumped our reservation to a non-renovated floor that faced the train. The bed had to have been 15 years old. It sagged terribly, and the pillows were practically flat. The photos they show on the site are the renovated floors, which seems like only 1/2 the hotel currently. If you stay, make sure to request a renovated floor. My husband did not sleep more than 2 hours the night we stayed. The bed was just so terrible, and we could also hear the train go by every 15 minutes. We checked out early and went to the Conrad Hilton down on Magnificent Mile. It was wonderful.", 
    "This is the first time we stayed in this hotel, but it will definitely not be our last. The service and comfort were wonderful and the hotel is within walking distance of nearly everything we wanted to see. The only downside is that you have to pay for the use of the workout facility, which was odd, but at least we didn't have to pay for parking!", 
    "Chicago was a great city to visit with kids, we took in all that the City had to offer like the Museum, Aquarium, Planetarium and the Willis and Hancock Towers. Followed that up with a Chicago Blackhawks and Bulls game at the United Centre. I would recommend this Hotel to stay at when visiting Chicago, it is within walking distance to all that Chicago has to offer and the kids enjoyed the 8th floor pool and hot tub.", 
    "We went with four teenage children and our little dog and enjoyed every moment. I can't think of anything that i would change except the restaurant was very expensive. Feeding my crowd is never easy but wow. The hotel is just amazing and very reasonable. I will come back and would give it 5 stars...", 
    "UN HOTEL MUY ELEGANTE, PERFECTA UBICACION BUEN SERVICIO, UN POCO CARO EN CUANTO AL RESTAURANTE Y LA CAFETERIA LO CUAL SE ESPERA EN UN HILTON LAS HABITACIONES MUY COMODAS", 
    "Great hotel for a reasonable price. Awesome location and beatiful facilities.", 
    "The hotel is very old and the room is fairly small. The best part about the room is that it has two bathrooms. During our stay, there was a construction crew working in the morning so that was really loud. Also our AC/Heater was broken. The rate we got was fairly cheap, but that means no WiFi no free parking. The Grand Ballroom is pretty awesome, but we're not on a business trip so that's meaningless for us.", 
    "Very nice hotel and employees parking is outrageously expensive though but would stay again", 
    "Hotel was great. Christmas stay, everything we wanted. Nice health club, great pool. All around great stay.", 
    "Newly refurbished room was excellent, nicely quiet, and I was given a free upgrade with extra room. Staff is always friendly and helpful. Loved the music at Kitty O'Shea's as usual - you can never get enough of Jimmy Moore and Pat Broaders - and I would choose to stay here just because of them!! While not as glitzy as some of the Mag Mile inns, the Hilton is still my favorite spot - comfortable and elegant without the pretentiousness. ", 
    "This was my second stay at the Hilton Chicago. I chose it again because it's an absolutely gorgeous hotel and I love the convenience of most rooms with 2 bathrooms - a wonderful luxury with 2 women and 2 teenage girls in the room! It also offers a large gift shop that came in handy when I had to emergently buy another pair of tights for my daughter when hers got a run. I would highly recommend this hotel!!", 
    "The Chicago Hilton is \"the\" grand hotel of the city. We stayed on Monday-Tuesday night, to visit various museums during the day. The hotel common space is splended for any era, and the Christmas decorations along with the Debutante Ball were wonder to witness. The rooms are indeed old, and have acquired the commensurate character over the decades. The only downside is the hotel suffers from the economic model of many large, urban properties, and finds it necessary to charge for things we assume would be free. Parking was $70 per day, the wireless (low-speed) internet as $13 per day, etc. Over all a great stay, and we will book there again for our next museum trip.", 
    "We visited Chicago for a Bears game and this hotel was one of the closest to the stadium. The hotel is in a great location downtown and is near tons of restaurants. The hotel decor was beautiful and the Christmas tree in the front lobby was breathtaking. We will friendly definitely stay here again the next time we're in Chicago. The staff was very friendly and welcoming.", 
    "Everything was great, except the cost of parking the car was almost as much as the room. I did spend time here while a college student at the Midwest. It brought back many memories.", 
    "While the hotel guest rooms themselves could use some updating, the hotel itself is beautiful!! We stayed with our two girls, ages 7 &11. They stated numerous times that they felt like royalty. That's how the staff and atmosphere makes you feel your entire stay. We absolutely will be staying here again! Thank you Hilton Chicago for making our Christmas vacation so memorable!", 
    "Room wasn't clean and they lied to us they cleaned it again. Then said since we booked through expedia they wouldn't do anything for us. Are we still not guests there?!?!?", 
    "Parking was $52 per day- in the heart of Downtown Chicago, fortunately we found great places to visit at walking distance. We loved the facilities. ", 
    "Location was good hotel was nice but the room was so small", 
    "Hotel is beautiful and historic. Many events were being held at the property during our stay. Was with a business partner so we really enjoyed the double bed room with two bathrooms. First time I had stayed in a room configured this way and was really good for our situation. No complaints other than we got stuck on the elevator briefly on check in, but the staff rectified within a minute or so (glad not claustrophobic) and I unfortunately left by toothbrush at home and asked for a complimentary one. Staff indicated that was no problem, but after visiting desk three times and one could not be produced there at which time I was assured that it would be sent to the room, it never arrived. Otherwise, a top rate property that was enjoyable. Parking is outrageous though.", 
    "Booked a king size room for a very special occasion and gave me a double bed room. Ruined my stay. Never cleaned the room in 3 days. Bad bad experience. ", 
    "Great location, you walk out the door on to Michigan Avenue!", 
    "It was nice and comfortable. Nice view, but I would've like to be able to stay in a higher floor", 
    "Went to Chicago for the CBE Classic this past weekend. Arrived later than expected and was greeted wonderfully. It was late so the staff took our luggage to our room for us, had an express checkout so we could get settled quickly. Woke up and ate at the buffet which was very good with a great selection. Took about 10 seconds to get a cab in front of hotel which was outstanding! Great location on Mich Ave, if it was nice out you could walk to most destinations but not terribly pricey in a cab. Went to United Center and it was only $10. ", 
    "Toilet was broke but hotel was extremely accommodating. Would definetly stay again.", 
    "Great hotel room with 2 bathrooms. Worked great having 2 couples. Perfect view of the lake. Our bellhop was very informative!!", 
    "I was in town for the weekend to attend both a Blackhawks and a Bears game. I've had good luck with Hilton Hotels before and thought I'd give this one a try. Over all the hotel is very impressive and gives you that feel of a bygone age. Loved ", 
    "Bathroom was old and cold , the wall heater was not working in the winter ", 
    "The staff are incredible! Especially the housekeeping people!!!", 
    "The Chicago Hilton is awesome! Close to all the main attractions. Will definitely stay here again!", 
    "Great staff. The room was nice and the bed comfortable. The Hilton has a top notch exercise center and multiple restaurants to eat at right in the lobby. Coffee shop too. I would stay again in a heartbeat.", 
    "Very nice room, with a great view! Overall, hotel is starting to show some minimal wear and tear, but still a very nice stay in the heart of downtown Chicago.", 
    "We got the double bed with the two bathrooms. Everything was good. It is a old hotel so I expected some out of date things. But overall my friends and I were happy and we enjoyed our stay. All of the staff was nice and helpful! The lobby is huge and beautiful. They even have a luggage drop off if your flight is later than the check out! The hotel was a good distance to everything. We used the subway and bus and taxi equally.", 
    "Everything was great, except.... 1) The toilet lid won't stay open on its own. What am I, a woman? Let me go #1 like the manly man that I am. 2) The coffee machine gave 3 coffee packets, 1 coffee cup and 1 coffee creamer. A little odd considering that I asked for two beds (aka a minimum of two people).", 
    "Don't stay at this hotel! The service is ridiculous and I was overcharged for service that I didn't use! I've called them multiples of times to fix this problem, not nothing was resolved. ", 
    "Stayed for a Bears game. Hotel was excellent value for price (especially if you don't park like we did, parking adds another $45). Room was spacious, clean, and the location was fantastic. Not sure if this is every night or just after Bears games, but they had added security of security guard that required you show your room key before accessing the elevators when we returned after the game. Walking distance from South Shore line, Soldier Field, Field Museum, Mag Mile and a ton of restaurants and shopping. Will Def stay there next time we go up for a game. Hotel lobby area was gorgeous.", 
    "I can't sum up how bad this place is in 15,500 words", 
    "Did a weekend getaway with my sister and had a fabulous time! The hotel is gorgeous, well-decorated and VERY clean. The staff was very polite and attentive. I feel like we got a very reasonable rate through Hotels.com and I'd absolutely stay there again. The Christmas decorations made the place especially fancy and charming!", 
    "Ok. Had better experiences in hotels that would be considered less than. The HILTON", 
    "I've always been a fan of this Chicago Hilton,but hadn't had occasion to stay there in recent years. Glad I made it back! I was celebrating a special birthday this year and the staff there made it feel very special. Funny thing was though, I never told anyone about it! That says it all. From front desk to bell man, bartender to waiter, housekeeping to room service...all the way up and down the line, staff were responsive, friendly and energetic. Kind of an old-fashioned cordiality, which really is 'the Chicago Way'. Very nice to experience. Thank you all. If you are looking for a place to stay in downtown Chicago, a little south of the frenzy of River North, but still accessible to all the great places/things that Chicago has to offer...do yourself a favor. Book here. You'll enjoy it.", 
    "Good location. Great hotel for the price.", 
    "Terrible wait to check in. Appears they were under staffed. The staff did not have any sense of urgency to get customers checked in. Went back to the check in desk to get another key for my room and had the same 30 minute wait. will not return.", 
    "Very nice hotel, and beautifully decorated for Christmas!!", 
    "This is a beautiful hotel filled with rich history. It has a business center, great workout facility, and multiple dining options. However, the room was very small for a family. We selected a room with two bathrooms, and although it was architecturally interesting, the desk and dresser in there were much too big for a family. The dining options in the hotel were rather expensive for a family, too. I'll bet business travelers love this place, though, because the rooms are super-quiet and the beds, although small, are comfortable. Couples would probably appreciate the sophisticated appointments, too.", 
    "The rooms view wasn't spectacular, but we were only using the room to sleep in, so that didn't matter. Having 2 bedrooms AND 2 bathrooms was great! My friend and I could easily get ready-which could be challenging for two females. Ample space in the room with desks and chairs.", 
    "Absolutely loved it! The hotel staff was very accommodating and the location was perfect for getting out and site seeing.", 
    "A quick trip to Chicago. Easy access to parking lot for safety of self park at night. Nice hote and good room.", 
    "thought i had a lake view room but didn't, but everything was fine!", 
    "Amazing hotel, we'll renovated, beautiful decor and very good location", 
    "Check in was early and was told there would be a $25 fee for early check but was waved. Food was good at the local bar restaurant. You can walk to anything in town.Room was clean but the blower on the heating unit was making a high pitch noise. Pool area was clean. Over all nice stay for $99. Make sure to check other parking if your driving. Easy off and on to the toll.", 
    "Room quiet. Slept well. 2 bathrooms a major plus.", 
    "Very nice hotel. Right on Michigan Avenue by Grant Park. Enjoyed our stay very much.", 
    "I really enjoyed my stay here ,I had a lovely room which overlooked the park and the lake .Everything was clean and comfortable and had everything I needed for my stay ,including nice high-end toiletries It's an easy walk to all of the sights and shopping. It was also easy to access the \"L\" ,just a short walk away ,which made returning to Midway airport much cheaper than by taxi. I didn't eat dinner at the hotel ,but I did have breakfast which I ordered from the a la carte menu .Everything was perfectly cooked and really well presented. I certainly would stay here again ,it's a great hotel.", 
    "Beautiful hotel. Always stay there when I can, love the history..awesome location!", 
    "Great staff! Great hotel and location for the money. Park at the self park a block away for 24$ a day. ", 
    "my only complaint with my experience came as I was going to drive out of the parking lot. I had purchased a room with free parking. As I was leaving the gate wouldn't go up. I don't know if something went wrong with the validation or what. An attendant finally let me out after checking my I.D. I'm still waiting to see if my charge card is going to be billed.", 
    "Hotel was nice,but would not let us check in early. I am guessing because we went through a third party site. Others we able to check in like the many people in front of us. We were also given the wrong room and when asked to get the right room they said no problem. Good thing it was after check in time. The front desk said they would call me when my room was ready which never happened. Over all nice hotel nice staf. I just wish hotels like this would treat everyone the same no matter which site you book them trough.", 
    "This hotel is great. The staff was awesome. The atmosphere is out of this world. If you are looking for a modern hotel then I would suggest you look else where. If you are looking for nostalgia, then you have come to the right place. The history of the hotel makes it worth the price. The location makes it all worth while. We ate at Kitty O'Shea's and the food and service were off the charts. If you read a negative review on here it must have come from someone with a bad attitude.", 
    "Hotel was a little farther from the heart of the city than anticipated. No microwave, wet bar, or fridge in the room. Entrance was beautiful, room was outdated and the first night I was not given a comforter. Just a sheet and thin blanket. Was told comforters were in \"high demand.\" Really? Would not stay here again.", 
    "Room temperature was uncomfortable and thermostat did not work. Room had water damage on the ceiling, wallpaper peeling, dirty bathroom and very thin walls. Self park was \"full\" so valet was your only option. We ordered room service which was very slow in arriving and the order was incorrect. Location was excellent but the hotel left a lot to be desired.", 
    "The room was very dated and had no mini fridge and the exhuast fan did not work in our bathroom. It was very clean and the rest of the hotel was amazing. I was let down by the room deocr and the lack of ammenties such as wifi. I would stay again, if the price for a newer room is comparable to others in the area. Overall a great experience with the staff just underwhelmed by my room.", 
    "Great atmosphere, very upscale with good service. The in-house cafe and restaurants are a nice plus. Add-on costs for wi-do and fitness club are annoying and excessive.", 
    "The location of the hotel was perfect for our trip! Easy walking distance to everything we needed and wanted (Christkindlmarket, State Street, Michigan Ave, etc.) plus great views!. My husband and I along with are two young children (ages 5 & 8) were only staying in the downtown area for one night so the room served it's purpose. The common areas are very well presented; a bit outdated but very charming. The rooms though were definitely outdated but functional. What's not to love about TWO full baths. The rooms are on the small side but for a night or two, it's perfect. Any more than that and we would have been uncomfortable. The check-in staff was very nice and answered all our questions without feeling rushed. I read somewhere on another review that they were charged to use the pool....we were not. The pool area was very roomy and clean. The one thing that really was a turnoff was their charge for Wi-Fi. In todays' day and age I thought that was odd. Other than that, we'd definitely stay again but would have to upgrade the room.", 
    "We had a number of problems but fortunately after talking to the right person they were all resolved. Problems started with some mistakes in our reservations which led to other things such as not getting our room cleaned, but the hotel worked things out. Although we were initially very frustrated, we will probably stay there again because the staff really seemed interested in making sure we had a positive experience and made a commitment to good service so we would want to come back again. I left feeling satisfied.", 
    "Rooms could use update, small beds, staff was excellent and friendly, would stay again", 
    "CLEAN, AND COMFORTABLE", 
    "My stay was good. Went there to watch my Cowboys beat the bears. Beds were comfortable room was nice. Slept good. Could have a little bit cleaner but over all I recommend. Parking was to high. But life in the big city.", 
    "We've stayed at the Hilton before and received the same great customer service as we had previously. The rooms are well kept. We head to the city for a football game every year and the location is perfect for our stay. The only complaint I would have is the cost of parking. $55 for overnight parking (17 hrs total) is a bit much--I could see $30, $40 at the very most.", 
    "We stayed there for 3 days. Hotel stuff are nice and warm, very open to help us. We ordered one queen br, but they changed for 2 king br for free at the counter. walkable distance to subway, field museum and quad. facilities are very clean and new. We are surprised by this decoration and quality by this price range. Also is very silent. You won't hear next door flashing toilet or showing. ", 
    "Wonderful experience!", 
    "We enjoyed our two night stay.", 
    "Hotel check in and check out very quick no hassles. Best of all this hotel made the best experience. With famous people staying here you always stand a chance of seeing them. Personally ran into several chicago bears football members. Along with the hotel and people it put this place over the top.", 
    "Hotel location is poor...out of the way for shopping, dining and Loop attractions. Food service is definitely way below the standard which their rates require. Restaurant staff in general was truculent at best. Internet was not free and the charge at $15.99 a day was excessive.", 
    "neighborhood nice enough but kind of out of the way. Also our reservation was messed up. Got an email from hotel.com reminding me of our stay. Got to the hotel and there was no reservation. Had to go to another persons room call hotel.com and after what seemed like about 10 minutes we finally got a confirmation number and were able to check in. The person at hotel.com was very nice and did all she could. The hotel was also very nice in accomodating us in this situation", 
    "Most staff helpful and friendly. Reception pushy for room upgrade. Wifi not free, and pricey. ", 
    "Went for thanksgiving with our son. The Hotel was 7 blocks from their apt and about that far to the Magnificent Mile shopping. Closer for cultural activities. The only bad review were for the \"child size\" pillows. Housekeeping did respond quickly with our request for extras. Also, our room was on the back wide of the hotel and the El was audible all night.", 
    "I really don't think this hotel is worth such that money. Room is clean and it will take about 5 minutes to drive to the Michigan Ave.", 
    "It was strange that someone came up to our room and told us that the room came up as vacant in thier records.", 
    "I have stayed at this hotel several times and it never disappoints. Service is great and location is very convenient.", 
    "The bathroom didn't work really well. Overall, not bad but not that good. Just 1 day live, so doesn't really matter how it feels.", 
    "Convenient", 
    "Not exactly the \"Magnificent Mile\"--much further south.", 
    "Great location, professional customer service, room were very Clean. Everything was wonderful !", 
    "Rented a suite for my birthday. Big room, gorgeous view of the lake, museums and parks. Walking distance to many attractions. Beautiful hotel lobby. The hotel is older and you can tell that in the hallways and elevators but I thought it was charming. Employees are very friendly and helpful. I mentioned it was my birthday just in passing to the front desk clerk and came back to the room in the evening to champagne, chocolates and a birthday card. Thank you very much if the hotel is reading this! I would definitely recommend this hotel and stay again.", 
    "No wi-fi free in the room", 
    "My brother, sister-in-law and niece stayed in this room over Thanksgiving. The hotel is close to our loft and provided the extra room we needed to accommodate everyone. The room was a bit small but it had two double beds and TWO BATHROOMS, which they loved! We booked this room blind through the Expedia special deal where you don't know the hotel name (just the approximate area) before you book it. It turned out to be a great deal. Thanks Expedia!!", 
    "Very nice hotel but a bit far if you are staying in Chicago for shopping, we took a cab couple times.", 
    "Having two bathrooms was convenient. The temperature in the room couldn't be adjusted and it was really warm, even in November with the windows open. Housekeeping didn't do much except make the beds. Dirty towels left, tables not cleaned off, dirty glasses left and no clean glasses left. Had to call and wait about 45 minutes for them to come up to room with clean ones. Beds were comfortable and the adjoined self-parking is very convenient. Not the best place we've stayed in Chicago but certainly not the worst. About a 10-15 minute walk to shopping on State Street.", 
    "We had a wonderful time in Chicago for Thanksgiving weekend and the stay at the Hilton only added to the experience. The friendly staff, great service, convenient location and fantastic accommodations made the trip that much better! Next visit to Chicago will include a stay at the Hilton!", 
    "The lobby was beautiful right when you walk in, friendly staff! Our room was very small and not as pretty as the lobby. the snack area in the lobby is wonderful! So much to choose from.", 
    "The building is beautiful and the location is one of the best in the city. That being said it was one of my least enjoyable stays in Chicago. The beds seemed to be old style spring mattresses that had seen better days and the shower was barely warm. The dog (WTH?) next door barked to much and their seemed to be whatt sounded like a freight car pass over our room for our entire stay.The towels had seen better days as well.", 
    "We stayed 4 fabulous nights for our long delayed honeymoon. The grand old hotel was beautiful and wonderful. We had a lake view that was amazing, seeing the Adler, the Shedd, and the Field museum on one side, and Navy Pier the other!! WOW! The Athletic Club had a nice lap pool. The staff was friendly and helpful. The only downside was our room was too hot. Not the worst thing on a honeymoon in November. But way too warm for comfort."

    "My stay was an augmentation of my wife's attendence to a large conference held in Chicago. The hotel has all the basic amenities and is in a fantastic location for touring. The room is large by Chicago \"Mag Mile\" standards. Problems with the Staff getting the room accounting correct (split invoice reflecting business and personal). We ended up having to facilitate this on our own once we got home. Also, cleaning staff were inconsistent in when they would be doing house keeping - and worse, taking their personal breaks while in our room (one housekeeper was on the phone when I arrived mid-afternoon). We recieved no housekeeping on the last day of our visit - how does that happen (and yes, we used the door tag.). If you want to stay in downtown Chicago where much of what your are interested in is in walking distance to much of what might interest you, this might (should?) be the place to stay. I hope the hotel can see fit to clean up its act (sorry for the pun!) A.", 
    "In the middle of Chicago, the Milenorth hotel provides quality rooms and great service. Our hotel room had a nice view and the facilities were nice. Our shampoo case unfortunately dropped off the wall whilst using it, but such things happen and it was taken care of. ", 
    "Very nice accommodations but the fly in the ointment was the fact that the parking is extra. And not just a little extra. $62 worth of extra. Nowhere was this mentioned by Expedia or the hotel. When I protested this exorbitant charge to one of the young ladies at the front desk I received nothing more than a blank stare. Helpful, apologetic or accommodating? Nope, not here. This ridiculous charge amounts to nothing but trickery & deceit. It's too bad because the place itself was very nice. Bartender and Bellman were friendly and helpful. We plan to return to Chicago a few more times this year. We won't stay there again. ", 
    "I really enjoyed my stay here. Staff was great. Rooms were great. ", 
    "Beautifully decorated rooms, very helpful accommodating staff. ", 
    "We stayed for 3 nights and everyday I requested a microwave but never got one. The people assisting at guest services didn't even have the courtesy to call back to advise whether one was available or not, even after saying that they would. To me, this is poor service. I wouldn't consider staying at the hotel again.", 
    "A very pleasant stay.. Great location ! It's close to water tower, lake shore, beach, navy pier and the river. Great room as well.. Hotel staff at the reception was very friendly.. Overall very good experience..", 
    "Huge room, clean, quiet, friendly and helpful staff. Nice to have a few breakfast choices in the lobby.", 
    "Room and hotel was outdated. Chipping paint on ceiling, old decor. Elevators were always a long wait. Great location! It was two blocks from all the good shopping. Very small lobby but there was a Starbucks on site which is a plus. ", 
    "Nice, clean, affordable hotel in downtown Chicago; within walking distance to Navy Pier. I would recommend it to anyone.", 
    "Great experience. Room had a good view, though not sure of others. The rooftop lounge was nice. The rooftop deck was not furnished due to the season and the weather but looks nice. The windows in the room and the rooftop bar were dirty so that impacted the views for sure. Staff at the lounge were delightful. Cynthia at the front counter was FANTASTIC! She helped me with a travel schedule dilemma and saved me money I'd otherwise have spent needlessly on an additional overnight stay. She delightfully directed me to a nice breakfast spot, as well. Always smiling and professional yet very friendly. Taxi service was always within 2 minutes and the staff was always helpful to hail a cab. The elevators were interesting with mirrors but made for a much more spacious feeling, though small. Hotel was in great condition everywhere I looked. The lobby was nice though could get crowded in the morning around their Starbuck's bar. The lobby bar was a bit underwhelming but you could still get a drink. The rate was good. The Museum of Contemporary Art was right around the corner. Steps from just about everything north of the river. I'd stay there anytime again!", 
    "Anniversary getaway. Upgraded room. Walking distance of everything. Would definitely come back.", 
    "So I'm getting better at choosing reasonably priced rooms that are spacious and it seems that a getting a great rate on a \"suite\" is the best option. I've stayed at over 10 -4 star (one 5 star) hotels in downtown Chicago and the standard king rooms were getting smaller by the booking so I tried a suite at the MileNorth and it was great. Not enormous but nice and spacious for my 2 nights. The bathroom was very small though but there was a nice spacious changing area that helped. Overall very nice hotel, room, and staff was great too! Barista in lobby was a nice addition. Walking distance to just about everything.", 
    "If you love the trendy aspects of the Thompson but not the price, this is a good, clean, friendly option in a great location. Aside from a dismal fitness center this place is a hidden gem waiting to be discovered. When that happens the price will probably go up! Food was good. There's a Starbucks on site. There's two bars with different feels for different times. The rooms are big enough and trendier than the chains. I found all but one staff member VERY friendly (one girl at the desk seemed like a mean girl from high school). Bottoms line- I'll be back!", 
    "This hotel could be perfect with a few updates. The lobby was pretty outdated as well as the room. Having said that, the room was huge, especially for downtown Chicago and we had a King size bed and a small refrigerator in the room. There were a few steps to get down to the room which were kind of a hazard, but overall I would recommend this hotel. You can't beat the location and the price was right.", 
    "Food is really pricey for the quality, the hotel is good. Great location, just had little communication on facilities, food or services in the room itself.", 
    "I was really surprised at how nice room was for the $$! Spacious ... Two tvs ... Two thermostats! Centrally located for walking! Highly recommend from a traveler that goes to chicago every year! Left a tablet in console of valet parked car... Called front desk... Had tablet within minutes! Sweet! ", 
    "Staff was super friendly.. We were super tired after a full day out and opted to grab a bite in the lounge. Food was tasty and atmospere very comforting.", 
    "Awesome staff, perfect location, welcoming lobby with a beautiful fireplace and super comfy bed!!", 
    "The hotel had a great location and was very clean. However, If you drive, parking will be expensive.", 
    "Clean and comfortable room in a very convenient location. Roof top bar is only open on Friday and Saturday.", 
    "It was a very basic hotel but for the right price the location was perfectly located off Michigan Avenue and within walking distance to most downtown activities.", 
    "Downtown Chicago has tremendous restaurants but the one inside this hotel isn't one of them. They served me way over fried chicken fingers, and by that I mean tasted, looked, smelled, etc... when I requested a replacement the response was polite but a little odd, \"we'd be happy to but they will come out the same way because it's the oil\". Oh...the oil makes them burned up and like chicken jerky? Maybe you should change the oil AND leave them in a few minutes less...just a thought.", 
    "Like everything about the hotel. Staff was very helpful and friendly, room spacious and clean, and was in a great location. Even though the hotel did not have a restaurant inside (some food was available in the lobby bar), there was a great pizza place next door and a lot of other places to eat nearby.", 
    "Went to shop and had a comfortable place to stay. Half a block off Michigan ave. close to everything. Staff was friendly. ", 
    "My husband and I just wanted a little get away. We decided to do a staycation and this place was the ticket!", 
    "Great hotel, front lobby is very nice and staff is friendly. Bathrooms could of been a little bit nicer, if staying at this hotel I would recommend a suite. ", 
    "It was first time in Chicago and Mile North hotel made a great first impression. Great location, great bar and rooftop. Would definitely recommend! ", 
    "relaxing and friendly staff that made the stay more enjoyable", 
    "I spent one night at MileNorth Chicago and was quite pleased. The location was great, the staff was exceptional and the room was clean and well maintained. ", 
    "We have become Destination Delivers members and have decided every time we come to Chicago (6/8 times annually) that we will always stay here. It doesn't matter if we drive or fly this hotel easily became our favorite after staying at several other downtown hotels. From the time you get there until the time you leave you feel like you are at home. The staff is very pleasant and willing to help you. The location to public transit and many touristy destinations can not be beat. ", 
    "This is the second time we've stayed at the Mile North Hotel and it is now the only place we will stay when we visit Chicago! The location in Streeterville could not be better. From the moment the doorman assisted us with our bags on arrival until the bellman helped unload our bags into the car our stay was the best hotel service we've had in years. Check-in and check-out was a breeze, the rooms spacious and very clean! The lobby buzzed from morning until evening with great music, a great full service coffee counter, full bar and the restaurant food was so good we ate there twice. Every employee we encountered was super nice, smiling and always helpful. We felt our Midwest roots shine when the afternoon doorman called us by name every time he saw us!! LOVE THIS PLACE!! ", 
    "Came back from 10 days in Ireland. 10 days of uncomfortable, hard beds. I was delighted to fall into a soft plush bed with wonderful blankets/comforter! Other than being totally out of whack with the time difference between the U.S. and Ireland, I had a very enjoyable stay-", 
    "Very nice hotel. Would definitely stay again. Would recommend this hotel to others. ", 
    "The only problem we had this time was the group partying in the hallway really late at night. We were ready to call but it calmed down after 12:00. I have stayed in your hotel several times because I am a patient at Northwestern and we come up the night before to avoid traffic being that we have about a 2 drive and my appointment are early in the morning. We of course love Chicago too. We haven't had this experience before so I am not totally upset and I don't know how this would be controlled anyway but it truly was rude for this group to scream for two to three hour in the hallway. ", 
    "Great location, friendly staff, pleasant atmosphere and beds comfortable.", 
    "Up to date, clean hotel, courteous staff, and close to shopping, and the American Dental Association building", 
    "very happy with location,price,hotel stuff and room...what else u can ask for?", 
    "Room and bathroom were surprisingly large, comfortable and clean. Staff was friendly and helpful. Less than a block to the middle of the Mag Mile. Oh, and there's a Gino's East right next door. ", 
    "last minute decided to find hotel and stay the night due to snow and complications at hospital that kept us there hours longer than planned. needed to be back at hospital first thing in the morning. found the hotel right across the street from the hospital on Expedia for a great price. Excellent stay, excellent location, excellent decision.", 
    "Very nice decor. Comfortable spacious room and great walk in shower.", 
    "Canceled at a different hotel due to noise and booked here we were on the top floor and it was super quiet!", 
    "Our stay was nothing short of amazing! Staff was pleasant and the room was nice and clean. The convenient location made the stay even better. We were walking distance from everything so a car was not needed. Truly a great experience!", 
    "It take a decent stab at beig a contemporary modern hotel. However, the room lacked many bulbs that were burned out and the walls were pretty thin so people can easily hear each other. Also another downfall is the surprise charge of \"incidentals\" which means parking. For a two night stay I paid $130 in parking. What a complete rip off. I would have been better off finding a nearby 24/7 parking garage and paid about half the cost or less instead. ", 
    "Very clean!! Our room was great and we have nothing but good things to say. The staff was fabulous. They kept our bags locked away for us as we arrived early and couldn't check in yet and they kept our bags again at departure as our train didn't leave until 645 pm. The location was truly the best and within walking distance of almost everything. ", 
    "Great spot, clean quiet and spacious. Can't wait to return.", 
    "Looking for a Chicago Hotel close to Prentice Women's Hospital, so I chose this hotel completely by the proximity to where I was going. ", 
    "Great neighborhood but would have rather stayed somewhere else for the money.", 
    "Everything about this hotel was fabulous - From the room to the staff! !! I find my new favorite hotel. ", 
    "perfect location. great staff", 
    "This was a quick weekend getaway for the local auto show. The hotel's location is prime if you like to be in the mix. We arrived early and there were no issues with checking into the room. I'm not sure when this hotel was built/remodeled but it is very up to date and clean. I will definitely stay at this property again.", 
    "It was a great location. The lobby however needs double doors as it was extremely cold sitting in the Bistro. ", 
    "This was a great central location for anyone looking to travel around the city and willing to walk a bit. Just a few blocks from the Red Line and tons of restaurants, easy to catch a cab. Room and bathroom were spacious. After a very early morning flight, we tried to check in early and they charged a $30 fee. Otherwise it was great.", 
    "The location of the hotel was excellent. The room in general was nice, clean, and comfortable, although very simple. The bathroom, however, left much to be desired due to the fact that the paint on the ceiling above the tub was cracking and peeling, and there was also mold growing. I did take a picture of it to show the concierge, who was going to show her manager and also maintenance so that they could remedy this before placing another visitor in that particular room. It was nice that there was a refrigerator in the room, but there was no microwave. Checking in and also getting our vehicle upon checkout was lengthy. We would have liked to look out our window, but the window seals must have been broken, because there was so much condensation and ice in between the two window panes we couldn't really see out at all. There is not a large selection of food/room service items available at this hotel if you are someone that likes to order room service or get a snack (we preferred to eat out anyway). Overall, I would say the hotel is okay. We were not in the room very much except to sleep, so since the room itself (outside of the bathroom) was clean and comfortable,the hotel was in an excellent location on Mag Mile, and we got a good price on hotels.com, I would consider staying again. I would definitely research other hotels in the same area though, and it is likely I would try a different hotel for my next stay.", 
    "What a find! Cute little hotel just off magnificent mile that I suprised my wife with for her 30th birthday weekend. Close to lots of things that we wanted to do and had a great time. I think several updates need to be done but overall this is a great hotel. Staff at front desk could use some training on how to be more friendly and do better with customer service but pleased guest all in all!", 
    "hotel was modern and the queen suite was very nice to relax in....didn't care for the bulk pump shower dispensers and towels were undersized yet heavy enough to dry off with. Staff was friendly and weekend lounge music was an added touch. Doorman was courteous on arrival but on departure was unconcerned. Would stay there again if price was right at $120-$150 a night not worth $300+ though valet @ $58 a night is tough to swallow but its Chicago", 
    "comfortable big room. Very conveniently located for Mag Mile shopping and restaurants", 
    "My stay was wonderful. the Hotel staff was exceptional particulaly, Whitney and Chris from the front desk. Sam the valet was pretty awesome too. All of them were very courteous and friendly. Whitney went above and beyond the call of duty. However, I do think it is important to make sure information on hotel policy regarding holding funds for \"incidentals\" is reflected on the hotels.com website.", 
    "Fantastic location and the room was super modern and comfy. The bed was one of the best things about our stay--firm but not too firm, and I slept like a baby. You can't go wrong with this hotel.", 
    "Booked this room at a great rate pretty last minute for a girls weekend. Upon arrival we chose to valet the car-which was rather steep at $58/night. At checkin I felt we weren't given clear information about the hotel. I learned while waiting to speak to someone at the front desk the next day that the bar served most Starbucks drinks and we were not clearly directed to which elevator we needed to use to reach our floor, small details that would have been beneficial earlier on. The room was nice, the carpet seemed very worn, the walls and ceiling needed some repair and in no way was anything dirty it was just older than some hotels. The bathroom was a nice size but had an odd layout with a really small shower/tub combo. While we did have a window, it was frosted so there was not a view. The location was perfect for Magnificent Mile shopping but not ideal if you are looking to see more than downtown.", 
    "The Mile North was a great hotel to stay at. The hotel staff, both valet, door staff, desk staff and lounge/restaurant staff were all genuinely friendly and helpful. Overall, we had a great time; however the room we stayed in was a solid 3 star room, not 4. I give it 5 stars for overall experience as a 3 star hotel, and 4 as a 4 star hotel. While it was nothing to complain about, the room wasn't exactly what I was expecting when I booked a 3 star hotel in River North.", 
    "Conveniently located to shopping, art and entertainment. We will definitely stay again.", 
    "This hotel is very comfortable with the ambience of a hotel in a large Western European city such as Paris or Amsterdam. Conveniently located just off the Magnificent Mile, it is accessible to shopping and restaurants that could keep anyone busy for weeks.", 
    "Nice appearance and trendy look, clean room, great lobby bar with a coffee shop, condition of room was a disappointment. Called for service on the shower, twice. No coffee table, even a trendy place would have an ottoman or something. Great place for a weekend getaway but not for a business trip.", 
    "Hotel is just off the Mag Mile. It is billed as \"urban chique\" and a wonderful blend of Humphrey Bogart in the lobby and classy modern in the rooms. Great shower. Nice clean room. A recliner by the window and an urban canyon view to the south that went on forever. Close to shopping, restaurants and theatre, (Looking Glass in our case). Northwestern's downtown campus is just down the block, if that is your need. We had a wonder full time, can't wait to go back in warmer weather so we can wander on foot more.", 
    "great internet", 
    "For a Magnificent Mile hotel I was prepared for a (forgive me) pretentious stay and experience. What I found was one of the warmest most welcoming lodgings in all of Chicago. Small and quaint with massive modern styled rooms and a guest staff that truly understand the experience is everything and customer service is the KEY to a great experience. I'm a raving fan!!! ", 
    "It was spacious and comfortable, very pleasent stay, I wasn't too fond of the lobby area but overall I would come again", 
    "We live in the Chicago suburbs, but stay downtown every so often... MileNorth Hotel is in a great location! It's always very clean and welcoming.", 
    "The hotel is beautifully decorated with a very curtious and helpful staff. Room was very clean and quiet (I was given an upgraded room upon checking in....very nice!) The Starbuck's coffee and snack bar was convenient...so was the bar and restaurant in the main lobby. I would definitely stay there again.", 
    "Hotel, location and staff are great. Our only negative is that the only common seating area is in the lobby with direct street access and during cold weather, continuous blasts of cold air hit you in the seating areas as folks come and go. At least the bar is away from the door.", 
    "This is a nice little boutique hotel in the heart of Chicago...great prices/service, clean and well maintained. I loved it. ", 
    "We stayed there to access Lurie Children's next door. The hotel is so nice inside. I loved the room we had, with steps down into it. The small room was designed in such a way that it seemed larger. The bathroom was fantastic with the large lighted mirror. The one and only complaint I had was that the bell hop/door person did not open the door for me when she saw that I was struggling to get my daughter and her stroller inside. There's also no room service, which was no big deal to us since we brought groceries to put in the fridge in the room. They do have accessible rooms, so if you have a wheelchair or difficulty with stairs, you should definitely pick that option.", 
    "Loved the overall experience. Great location. Fairly priced, will definitely stay again ", 
    "Refreshing and peaceful", 
    "Great location at an affordable price. Room was clean. Staff was helpful. Also, for being a guest at MileNorth, we were able to avoid the long wait for a table at neighboring Ginos East on a busy Saturday night. We got to go to the front of the line. I would recommend MileNorth for any stay in the Windy City.", 
    "The location is fantastic! Right next door to a famous Chicago pizza restaurant. You are literally a couple minutes from Magnificent Mile shopping district. You also are about 30 minutes by car from Chicago O'Hare airport. As for the hotel itself? Well, it's pretty plain in the rooms. Seems like a motel. You got a shower, coffee maker, empty fridge, microwave (upon request), and a TV. I had issues with the TV and phone. They had to switch rooms bc my TV wouldn't stop shuffling channels, and my phone only worked on speaker phone. In the new room, the cable shows were really fuzzy. Maybe it was just the cable company having issues? The lobby of the hotel is great. Nice waiting area, coffee shop, and snack bar. The hotel staff are very professional and friendly.", 
    "When I travel for business I want: clean, safe, quiet, premium bedding, control of the thermostat, and nice toiletries. MileNorth had all of these and not only did I sleep well, I actually slept an additional hour in the morning (bit late to the office but so worth the trade-off from a comfortable room). 18th floor, corner room. The lobby had a social crowd and I suspect I was given a room away from any party-goers, for which I was grateful. Responsive front desk staff.", 
    "Arrived at 4:30 to check in, only one employee was checking in people at front desk, a line was backed up, our room was not ready. Rooms were a bit old. Moldings, bathroom needs fixing up. Temps in hall and elevator were roasting hot and a bit uncomfortable. Beds were comfy. Short staffed. The upper level bar should be open in the winter. ", 
    "Best hotel I've stayed in, during my two-month trip around the US. Location: Right near the Magnificent mile, main tourist street in Chicago Room: A+++++", 
    "Wonderfully attentive, welcoming, friendly, professional staff. Not sure why this hotel is not rated as a 5 star hotel. It definitely is. My wife and I travel a lot and she calls me a hotel snob (which is actually very true) because I'm so critical, impatient and picky. I'm telling you stay here. You will be glad you did. Great location. Comfortable, CLEAN, well appointed rooms, etc...", 
    "Good times, bar staff were great. Responsive front desk to inquires.", 
    "The hotel has a great location. The lobby is comfortable, although a bit chilly when the doors open and the freezing blast enters. The lobby bar has a nice selection of wines and munchies. The room was large and provided plenty of room for us to move around. Our room's bathroom was in need of updating -- tiles were cracked and kind of old, the paint under the sink was bubbly, and the tub was old. The rooftop lounge that sounded so lovely is closed for the winter -- no mention of that anywhere except at the front desk. ", 
    "Great hotel with a nice feel. Bad experience with front desk staff. Annie allowed us to check in at 2:30pm instead of 4pm because she assured my wife and I that I would not be charged $30 to check in at that time. 3 days after returning home I see that my credit card was billed anyways. NOT IMPRESSED!", 
    "great location, clean and quite room, nice staff, convenient transportation, just two minutes walk from the magnificent mile of downtown Chicago", 
    "Great location right on millenium mile! Cool, urban decor and very attentive staff! Will definitely return to this hotel.", 
    "We had a very comfortable room in a smaller hotel but quality matches the big ones,", 
    "Perfect for my 3 nite stay. One drawback- bathroom lighting too dim. Staff and restaurant extremely accommodating.", 
    "Had to stay because of my son's stay at the Children's hospital. I was given some information about the area and it mentioned a discount given for hospital families. I called from the hospital room and the rate given was actually more with the 'discount' then just booking online. I mentioned that to the person who took my call and she confirmed. So, really there's no discount at all. I booked anyway because it was late. Room was very clean and pretty nice. The heater was loud and turning down the knob either direction wouldn't change it. Luckily, the room temp was tolerable.", 
    "Hotel muito bem localizado. Proximo de restaurantes, lojas. Tambem perto da largada da maratona de Chicago.", 
    "Very cool, chic and cozy! Loved our stay there! Excellent city view, great service and staff!", 
    "the tv didn't work too great, but overall, it was a very nice hotel. no room service available! i was surprised", 
    "Staff was exceptionally helpful and accommodating. Husband and I celebrated our one year anniversary. Everyone was quite considerate in acknowledging the milestone!", 
    "This is my second stay there. Rooms are really fantastic. Mine had a view towards Hancock Tower. Really spacious, all super modern and fancy. Parking across the street is super expensive, 52.00 per day, so look further / wal a bit for a better rates. Both times there were some noises/arguments from neighbors, but overall it is a great stay near the Magnificent Mile!", 
    "Large, clean, modern room with mini fridge. Stayed here NYE and enjoyed their swanky rooftop bar 52eighty to bring in the new year.", 
    "My favorite Hotel in Chicago, thus far. I try to stay there every time I'm in the city.", 
    "very close to all thing you want to see in Chicago $ 36 to Airport five mn to the beach Starbuck in the Hotel not included in the room ad $ 20 +++++++", 
    "My wife and I just stayed one night and it was great. From check in to check out, everything was fine. ", 
    "The hotel is very nice & it's in a great location! The staff was very friendly - from the desk personnel to the valets!", 
    "From check in to check out the staff were exceptional and welcoming, Chris at the front desk I especially want to recognize for his great first impression. The room was spacious and well appointed, I loved the large bathroom and shower. The lobby decor is modern lovely. ", 
    "We loved the location. We like to walk around so being so close to Water Tower and Michigan Ave this was a perfect location. Plus only 3 blocks from Holy Name Cathedral (another tradition Sat Mass). The staff was very friendly and accommodating. We would definitely recommend.", 
    "We enjoyed our stay, and we were surprised by the size of the rooms. The hotel has a very casual/no-rush feel in the middle of the busy city. The location was great, especially for taking our parents on their first sight-seeing trip to Chicago. We will definitely stay again. As a negative, there is a roof top bar on the 29th floor that my wife wanted to go to, but it was closed. Probably because we were trying to go on a Sunday night at the end of December.", 
    "My significant other and I decided to have a Staycation. And wanted to spend the weekend downtown. This hotel is in the most ideal location. Walking distance to the red line, cta bus lines and all shopping needs. The hotel itself is very urban and clean. The room we had was phenomenal. We had a clear view of the John Hancock building. We had everything we needed. The only down fall for us is that the bed was very hard. That may be just a preference for me and my significant other but we have no complaints overall.", 
    "Location was perfect. This hotel is not fancy. It is affordable and very clean. Rooms are a little dated but trendy looking. I would stay again as it was ideal to site see and the staff was super chill and friendly.", 
    "Fabulous!", 
    "Everything was good, but wi-fi was terrible. The location is really good for people who want to shop on Michigan AVE", 
    "Such a great place to stay! They let me check in 3 hours early and room was beautiful. Great price and location was perfect. Will be back for sure. ", 
    "Loved the boutique style of the hotel. Great location for shopping and dining. Excellent lobby area-so much character.", 
    "Great place to stay. Right in the midst I the beautiful downtown area. ", 
    "Great boutique like hotel. Beautiful, modern interior and rooms. We got a great price on the room which made it even more worthwhile. Only wish is that the bed was a little more comfortable! It was a little too soft and springy for my liking! Will likely be back though if we can get a great rate again. Very friendly staff!!", 
    "terrific location. 2 blocks from a Corner bakery for breakfast, one block from Mich. Ave, staff was helpful.", 
    "I've stayed at MileNorth a few times and the hotel rooms are great. Really comfortable and spacious. Location is close to a lot of restaurants and it's a 2 minute walk to the lake. Only valet parking is available and it's a bit pricey. Onsite restaurants are nice for dining however if you're looking for breakfast you'll have to walk a few blocks.", 
    "Excellent location in the heart of downtown. Lobby is small but has a cafe and bar for quick food and drink. Good for walking to hotels, restaurants and shopping.", 
    "Everyone was extremely helpful. Big selling point was the \"Green option\" if you choose not the have yourtowles washed daily they get you a $5.00 credit to the Starbucks in the lobby. ", 
    "Right in the heart of Michigan Ave. Love the location. Staff great. Rooms very nice.", 
    "Turn the heat down in the building 75-80 degrees", 
    "MileNorth was clean and convenient.", 
    "Valet, reception , and front desk were excellent . Ventilation in the room was too loud. We would return. B minus", 
    "Location was perfect for downtown fun along Michigan Ave. Staff was great at check-in and throughout our stay. They were very helpful regarding restaurants and nightlife.", 
    "I stayed here for my birthday with my boyfriend.. We loved it! We had one of the corner suites on the 28th floor and we thought it was a great room for the price! All of the staff were so nice, friendly, and accommodating! Would definitely stay there again!", 
    "Hallways were HOT!! There was a thermostat control in my room which was great to have. Possibly going back to Chicago in a couple weeks and I'll look into this hotel first to stay again.", 
    "There are so many hotels in Chicago that you don't have to settle. This hotel was clean but not very luxurious compared to the other hotels I've stayed at. No room service, no pool, coffee shop that's advertised is a small bar/lounge. Room was very simple to me, not impressed at all. ", 
    "The service was exceptional. At checkin, Yolanda was very professional, courteous and provided excellent service.", 
    "Wasn't sure what to expect, having never heard of this hotel before it was featured on hotels.com. Needless to say, I wasn't disappointed; I brought my girlfriend here (and the city) for her birthday and she absolutely loved it. Rooms are a little small, but very well put together and comfortable. Only downside - no pool. But we lived without.", 
    "Great", 
    "Very friendly staff, and the room was fantastic. Beds were extremely comfortable. I love having a refrigerator in the room!", 
    "Very much enjoyed your hotel. Great location. We liked our King -Suite room a lot. Would prefer the bathroom door be solid and not opaque/partially allowing light thru. That was an issue for the person still trying to sleep.", 
    "Great location and clean rooms! Also a very helpful staff - definitely would recommend this hotel!", 
    "Talk about a great location! This little gem of a hotel is right in the thick of things. Great for unloading all the purchases midway through the shopping day. This hotel should be on your list for your Christmas shopping trip. The hotel lobby can get very cold with the large revolving door...so plan to dress warmly for inside or out!", 
    "It was great the staff was very nice.", 
    "Good: excellent location. free wifi (bit unreliable though). Negatives: lifts - only 2; and if 1 goes out of service, its a long wait. Shower is not great. Conclusion: overall, a reasonable stay; but somewhat expensive for the current property features. The staff are excellent.", 
    "The tv Chanel's and were awful and the tv was grainy. We had room service bang/open our door inconveniently a few times. Overall experience was great though! Would go again!!!", 
    "I paid $99 for 2 bedrooms with my friend. The hotel was just perfect. Nice view, nice attitude of staffs. But the housekeeper knocked the door too many times, lol. ", 
    "Perfect location to do everything you want on magnificent mile and around", 
    "For $69 it was a steal!", 
    "I came her for a girls weekend. The room was great and in a fantastic location!", 
    "All the common areas were too hot! Not 4 star", 
    "This place was amazing. Room was great, staff was super nice, like really freaking nice. I mean this place was so great looking. I walked into the lobby and felt so underdressed next to the Starbucks, snazzy little cocktail bar, desk of iMacs, lounge chairs and cozy fireplace all while light tinkling piano music played. This looks like a 5 star hotel in Silicon Valley where you need to wait 3 months for a reservation and you can only enter if are a member of some exclusive club. There is a bar in the lobby open to 10pm, a bar on the 19th floor open till midnight, a 24hr fitness floor, and the rooms... Oh man beautiful windows, the shampoo and body wash they give you is gentle on your hair and body, it smells great too. The coffee in the room wasn't bad and the room was of ample size. We had a queen single room. We couldn't have been happier. Then the next morning we came down and asked the clerk about breakfast, she suggested 3 little places near by immediately, gave us directions and said 'Just call the front desk if you get lost, I'll walk you through!' I am in love with this place. I live in the city of Chicago and just stayed there just because, but now I'm going to be staying there a lot more instead of my own home! If you can get the room at a good price book this place. This second. Do it.", 
    "Last minute trip to Chicago so I wasn't planning to spend alot of money. I was happily surprised. The room was of fair size and clean. Tastefully decorated with comfortable beds. Located a block from Michigan Ave. so you will be close to some action. Whenever I return to Chicago this hotel will be near the top of my list.", 
    "overall the room and experience was great. I wish the front desk staff was a bit more friendly and that they'd been better at making a parking suggestion because the place I had to park cost $52 for about 8 hours.", 
    "The MileNorth Chicago was the perfect hotel for the second stop on my wife's 50th birthday celebration tour. Our king suite was well-appointed and comfortable. The location was excellent -- steps from Michigan Avenue -- close to great restaurants and shopping! The staff was great! I would highly recommend it, and will stay there again!", 
    "Nice place for two women travelers. Safe, clean, friendly and welcoming. ", 
    "I had a good experience here. I stayed two nights. I appreciated the coffee/tea bar in the lobby. Particularly welcome on an uncommonly cold November day. Room was comfortable. Really, I had no complaints. I will go back there. It is a few steps from Michigan Ave and just a block from the Water Tower Place. ", 
    "Awesome hotel. Good time. We loved it. But not the fact that I have to write a lot to complete this survey ", 
    "Very nice great location Friendly staff. Will stay there again ", 
    "Chose this hotel because it was right by the Museum of Contemporary Art Chicago where we attended the \"David Bowie Is\" exhibition. Hotel in great location, staff all very professional and helpful. Lobby was relaxing area with warm fire wall and cozy seating, availability of food and drink. Beds comfortable, room clean and quiet though not as updated as lobby. Only problem was giant crack in porcelain sink in bathroom, not pleasant to look at, but informed staff and hopefully taken care of.", 
    "This is our favorite hotel in Chicago.", 
    "Excellent location. The hotel was most accommodating.We had reserved a room for the wrong date. The hotel had a room for us anyway and it was no problem. The breakfast nook in the lobby was fast, simple and good. You cannot beat the location just off Michigan Avenue. The rooftop lounge in warm weather would be quite a neat setting.", 
    "I booked the tower queen suite for one night. It was very spacious and comfortable. There was a queen bed and pull out couch. The pull out couch (located in the sitting area)could also sleep two people. Cant complain. We even had a view of the Hancock. There is also a makeup table right outside the bathroom. That was very helpful to have while I was getting ready for the evening. Overall a very good experience. Great location and wonderful staff. Would stay here again.", 
    "Arrived in Chicago without a room, googled and booked MileNorth in minutes of arriving in Chicago. The original Gino's pizza place is right next door. We grabbed supper there after checking in. The staff at MileNorth were very friendly and more than eager to tell us local spots that weren't jusy tourist attractions too. LOVED MileNorth! Not a single bad word to say! I would stay here again in a heartbeat and reccomend it for friends!", 
    "The bed was terrible. Every time you moved it made so much noise like it would break in half. Not comfortable at all and kept us up through the night.", 
    "From the moment we arrived the staff was exceptional! We were greeted first by Henry who explained check in procedures and valet parking. The ladies working the front desk were very friendly. Henry brought our luggage to the room and explained all the hotel had to offer. Throughout our visit Henry made sure we were well taken care of. I would definitely recommend this hotel to friends!", 
    "It was what I expected. When I checked in, I secured with a card, but wanted to check out with a different card. Well, their cc machine was down so she had me complete a form to run the charge later. Well, they charged my AMEX card and also my bank debit card. They can't resolve this with one call so now I have to call back and speak with the Director or Accounting.", 
    "When i first got to the hotel i thought wow cool hotel and junk ", 
    "This was a beautiful hotel", 
    "good. scored a free drink. enjoyed my meal at the roof top bar. disappointed that Wi-Fi wasn't included in room rate.", 
    "Great location. Love the boutique type hotel - you don't have to wait for elevator! Nice to have Starbucks/ food in the lobby. Drinks at the top bar were way too pricey. Will stay here next time I'm in Chicago!!!1", 
    "Large spacious room, would definitely stay again. Super Quiet, nice roof top bar and just off the Mag Mile.", 
    "I only stayed for one night but I really enjoyed the environment. The rooms are clean and quiet.", 
    "I loved staying here, but the room was a little pricey. Overall was a great stay.", 
    "I stayed here for two nights and the bartenders was great front desk staff wAs not helpful. We checked out early due to a emergency and one of my girl friends called the hotel looking for me and the front desk staff told my friend all of the personal business and information. I then called Nd spoke to a manager and the her response to it was well thats your problem not ours i then stated if im a guest and checked out and friends is calling looking for me as a privacy act only information that should of been given out was she is checked out and no longer staying with us. There shouldnt be absolutly no reason why my friends knows what happened at the hotel. Now i, currently in the process of reporting the hotel for giving out personal information to outside people who is not registered to the hotel.", 
    "This hotel was beautiful and really conveniently-located. It did not have a bathtub, but everything else about my stay was awesome.", 
    "Old hotel. Dirty room. I would not recommend this hotel to anyone. ", 
    "Very comfortable and quiet room. Great location just off the Magnificent Mile and beside NorthWestern Hospital. Lovely and cozy lobby with barista bar.", 
    "I had a wonderful time! Quality time with my wife and daughter!!! The hotel is amazing especially the roof top!!! I will return!", 
    "Just arrived back from a 6 night stay at the MileNorth Hotel. When we arrived the staff were polite and friendly, we were also upgraded to a bigger room facing the front of the hotel - could not have asked for better. Ate twice in the hotel and the meals were good. Also a brilliant Italian Restaurant next door Gino's East. Hotel right beside the main shopping street, there was also lots of resturants and pubs round about. Close enough to walk to Navy Pier and down to the river. Would stay here again if in Chicago. ", 
    "The hotel is in a great location so close to everything. Staff were pleasant and helpful. The hotel was tidy and clean. Stairwell was a bit small but I am sure that is related to the hotels age. Would stay there again. ", 
    "Stayed here for a conference at Northwestern University Medical Center. Great location for shopping, with many dining options too. Comfortable room and very friendly staff. Nice to have a Starbucks and a bar in the lobby. ", 
    "Nice location, great rooftop bar with best bartender (Manny) i have yet encountered. Really made me feel welcome and glad to be here.", 
    "Attended our daughter's wedding at Germanie Hall. The hotel was a perfect location!", 
    "Paying $50 to check in a couple hours early to an already-empty hotel room is not service...it is profit-maximization.", 
    "Booked and stayed the same day. The room was well stocked, clean and comfortable. The lobby was clean and unique. There is a hospital next door with a parking garage that charges $52 a night self Park or the hotel can valet for $58 I believe. There was another parking garage right behind the hotel/hospital that was only $42 a night which is good for downtown in my opinion. Overall good location and great stay. ", 
    "I was surprized by the pleasant and attractive decor. We enjoyed the location as well.", 
    "Had a great time", 
    "Close to the Magnificent Mile and major attractions, however, the hotel was just okay. Nothing overly great at all about the hotel. Its mainly just in the thick of everything happening in Chicago. ", 
    "Booked three rooms for 5 nights, for a family wedding. We were able to get an upgraded room that worked out very well for my 88 year old mom. She spent more time in the hotel room than the rest of us so it was nice that she had a chair, couch and table and chairs and fridge. They also let us borrow the hotel wheel chair when we took mom out. Very pleasant stay. ", 
    "Had no idea parking wasn't included. It was $58 just about half of the cost of the stay. Would not have selected knowing that upfront", 
    "The number one reason we keep coming back is the rooms are the quietest I have ever stayed in for the price range. I am disappointed in the fact the restaurant is closed... the lobbuy based Starbucks is like a neglected step-child... meaning they were out of a couple ingredients on a Saturday morning into Sunday morning. The rooftop lounge is nice, even if the clientele are a little out of place for what the lounge is trying to be. The maintenance is starting to fall behind, especially noticeable in the bathroom. But we keep coming back and will continue to do so as long as the price point stays the same or, if they do increase rates they put some money into maintenance and reopening the restaurant.", 
    "Very nice modern room, clean and spacious. Very quiet on 15th floor. Only downside was the pull out sofa bed was extremely hard. Other than that no complaints.", 
    "I have stayed at this location four times, and it is GREAT every time. Perfect location, considering it is for me and my daughter, so we wanted a safe and convenient location to shopping. Only half a block off of Michigan. Great staff, good food when we needed a bite to eat. Spacious rooms, clean, and right next door to Gino's East....YUM! No need to consider any place else.", 
    "Really nice weekend. The staff was great, extremely helpful and friendly. ", 
    "Otima localizacao ao lado da av michigam. Perto de tudo .", 
    "Mile North is my go-to in Chicago. Great staff (especially Manny at the Bar), wonderful views, and a convenient location. It's steps from Michigan Avenue and next to a Gino's East Pizza. The coffee shop downstairs has a great ambience and is super convenient before a day of meetings or urban exploring.", 
    "The employees are wonderful here, as is the location to downtown, Michigan Ave, Prentice, shops...however this time I was in room 609- the gym is directly above me...weights banging down, people running the treadmill on my head ( kind of) way too loud- and its open 24hours...", 
    "Great!", 
    "We came to Chicago unexpected and needed a room. This hotel was nice, reasonably priced. We would definitely come back.", 
    "While the rooms have been upgraded - there were still a few things in our room that weren't quite up to par with what we paid per night. Peeling materials from the sink back splash, side table lamps that didn't work. Little stuff, but enough to notice. Also, with 8 rooms on our floor, you would think that it would be peaceful and mostly quiet. Not the case, anytime anyone was in the hallway talking, it sounded like a whole marching band was going by. They could also do everyone a solid and warm up the lobby a little bit.", 
    "Were in town on vacation with daughter and grandson. We knew we would be spending long days walking and wanted a great hotel/great room to unwind in at the end of the day. Booked 2 suites and they were awesome! Plenty of room to kick back and relax when the walking was done. Close to many great shopping establishments and all price levels of great food. Staff were polite, knowledgeable and always courteous. Parking ramp across street is very convenient but expensive even with self park. All in all, fantastic stay in a great city.", 
    "Great location, between the river and the Hancock Building. Only downside was small soft beds - double, not queen - so not appropriate for more than two persons. Also almost no soundproofing on the room wall so all noise in the hallway was very loud, including housekeeping which started early at 8 am.", 
    "very comfortable and modern room with perfect location near Magnificent Mile. Excellent and friendly staff all around. loved the rooftop lounge and restaurant /bar off lobby. tiles in bathroom floor should have been updated with last renovation, but still not in bad shape. Would have liked an easy chair also in addition to the desk chair for seating. lobby decor is very unique and stylish. Direction of air flow from air conditioner blew right on us while we were sleeping. like the idea of having optional housekeeping service and thought the vouchers were an excellent idea. no problems with check in, but still waiting for receipt from our stay. Would we stay again? ABSOLUTELY!!", 
    "Lots of choices of places to stay in Chicago, and I go there plenty. Probably stay in Chicago 25 days a year. The MileNorth has become one of my favorite places to stay. Comfortable with great service. No room service or restaurant in the hotel, but many options nearby. I will be back.", 
    "Relatively comfortable room - very spacious. Great staff, accommodating and friendly and welcoming. Not great lighting in the bathroom (if makeup is part of your routine) and the bi-level entrance, while impactful, is a bit awkward.", 
    "Great location. Front desk staff very friendly and helpful. Room very clean and comfortable. ", 
    "Very enjoyable! Celebrating are 40th Anniversary ", 
    "pontos fortes localizacao wifi era gratis (parece q nao eh mais) frigobar cama confortavel quarto bem escuro para dormir e claro para ler banheiro grande academia restaurante nao paga taxa de encomenda dos correios pontos fracos nao tem cafe incluso. tem q pagar a parte ducha do banheiro fraca e com problemas nao tem microndas nao tem congelador", 
    "Stayed at several hotels and this one was very convenient. Roof top lounge was very comfy, with friendly staff.", 
    "Great location. Can walk to almost all sights. Loved the rooftop bar.", 
    "Loved this hotel! Easy to get to, very cute room and loved the Starbucks in the lobby. Jessica at concierge was a bit rude but other than that it was easy and nice! Bad view but that's to be expected in the area. ", 
    "My main complaint is that although I had paid in advance I was charged a daily 'service fee' of $4.95. Why? The amount is small and suggests the hotel like to squeeze a little extra out of customers, assuming they will not complain. I will not stay here again or recommend the hotel.", 
    "We were in town for the birth of our granddaughter....things were not going well and it was such a comfort to find a wonderful hotel only steps away.", 
    "Clean and quaint. Close to everything I like.", 
    "Had a great time, walked all over downtown. Went to the 94th floor of the Hancock building and saw amazing views of Lake Michigan and all of Chicago.", 
    "Very well located. Very nice friendly staff. Clean.", 
    "Great location and staff was extremely helpful and friendly.", 
    "Great location, very nice and roomy rooms. The walls however are very thin. I could hear the guy next door snoring and the TV like I was in the room. ", 
    "First time ever in the mile north , and I really like the place a lot I plan to return soon . I stayed in room 1907 and would request that room over and over again it's just that nice. The staff was friendly and very nice. It's a great home away from home.", 
    "Easy walking distance to Michigan Ave and all shops and restaurants. ", 
    "Lovely despite rain", 
    "I've stayed in Chicago many times and most hotel rooms have been nice but extremely small. I was amazed at the size of our room. It was huge. A king size bed along with tv in the bedroom area, nice sofa/lounge area with another tv and a spacious bathroom. It by far exceeded my expectations. It was in an area that was close to all the amenities and the hotel had a lovely cafe/bar that was situated in the lobby. The staff were very helpful and friendly. What I also liked was the option that you could \"go green\" by opting not to have your room cleaned and using your towels for the duration of your stay. We stayed 2 nights and opted to do this as it really didn't make any difference to us. For doing this they offered you a $5 voucher to use in the cafe. I liked this and thought it was defnitely the way to go being more eco friendly. I would definitely stay here again and would recommend this hotel to others.", 
    "I think this is a great little find. The staff were all very friendly and personable. My room was neat, clean and comfortable, although the carpet had seen better days. You can't beat the location for dining, sightseeing and shopping. I'd definitely make a return visit.", 
    "I very much enjoyed my stay and had no complaints, room was lovely, location great and staff very helpful however.....after my stay I noticed that I had been overcharged on my credit card. I have tried several times in vain to get a response from the hotel with no success. This is leaving a very sour taste after what had been a great trip.", 
    "The hotel was great with a beautiful location, but I was double charged on my room and valet. That really discourage me.", 
    "I had a conference at Northwestern. The hotel was on the same block. The Magnificent Mile was one block the other way with multiple shopping locations and restaurants within walking distance. The front staff was extremely friendly and greeted me by name several times during my stay. I would stay here again and would highly recommend this hotel to my friends.", 
    "Enjoyed the location. Close to all the action and shopping. Roof top bar was enjoyable.", 
    "Great hotel and couldn't have wished for a better location. Right next to the magnificent mile. We had a signature suite and it was spacious and very comfortable. The staff were very pleasant so what more could you want.", 
    "Our experience was awesome from the time we walked in the Hotel till the time we left. The staff is amazing and our suite was superb. It was really wonderful having a Starbucks right in the lobby. The beds are so comfy ", 
    "This was a nice, upscale, clean hotel that would compete with any big name chain. Friendly staff and reasonable rates during my stay. A quick walk to lots of places. It was a nice surprise.", 
    "We loved our room and the view. We had a problem with the air conditioning the first night but we reported it the next morning and they sent someone up right away. It was fixed by the time we returned that evening. Staff was friendly and helpful. Would recommend and would go back!", 
    "Starbucks in lobby and next door to pizzeria for quick bite on the go. Easy walk to Red Line.", 
    "The hotel was in a great location straight on to the magnificent mile. All the amenities and site seeing could be located a stones throw away but in the hotel, the rooms were really quiet and downstairs great coffee! The staff were fabulous and could not have done more for us. My husband had an accident on travelling to the hotel and as soon as he walked through the door they has plasters, antibacterial spray and a variety of creams to help him. They also made telephone calls regarding the accident on his behalf. Perfect hotel in every way!", 
    "Huge rooms, great service, friendly staff. Would definitely stay there again.", 
    "Very pleased, no problems, nice lobby area for gathering prior to make plans for the day", 
    "The hotel and the staff was nice over all. However the walls are really thin. I could hear the guest next door talking which made it difficult for me sleep. ", 
    "Great location on the Mile! If your parking a car go to Spot Hero and the Huron Superior garage and elevator is directly across the street. Very narrow hotel with like eight rooms per floor.", 
    "Very pleasant stay at MileNorth in Chicago. Great location and hotel staff. Close to restaurants, stores and Northwestern Hospital.", 
    "We loved it. We wished we could stay longer. Loved the location right off of the Mag Mile. Loved the interior of the hotel, and the food and drinks were really great at the hotel bar on the lobby. The 52eighty bar at the top was excellent as well. Wished there wasn't a charge to check out late though :(", 
    "Lovely stay, close to the beach and the shopping! Amazing views from the rooms at huge top and the rooftop bar was great.", 
    "The location was fantastic. I was coming down from Milwaukee for Riot Feet and we had no problems finding parking and public transportation to and from bars and the festival. I would stay here again if I can find it within my budget.", 
    "This was a quick stay for a business trip, and I was only in the hotel to sleep for one night. I can say that the bed and pillows were quite comfortable. There was a fridge in the room, which would have been handy if I'd stayed longer, especially since Gino's East is right next door. I was disappointed though that when I arrived I was informed that the king suite I had reserved was not available and I would need to be placed in a queen suite. I was charged the lower rate for the queen, but as I was checking in at 11:00PM and looking forward to that king bed, it was a real let-down. The room was clean and a good size, but I couldn't get the deadbolt on the door to work properly, which was a huge security concern for me since I was traveling alone. I ended up jamming the desk chair in front of the door for peace of mind that there was an extra obstacle to get in the door, but that's certainly not ideal. The shower had good water pressure, and there was plenty of hot water.", 
    "Definitely enjoyed our stay. This hotel is perfectly located for morning runs along the lake as well as shopping on Michigan Avenue. The staff were all very friendly and the room was clean. We had a great visit in Chicago!! ", 
    "First room smelled like smoke (whole floor did), carpeting was tore up, bathroom looked ghetto. They gave me new room on new floor which didn't smell , but the paint was chipping, room very dusty, and very old amenities. TV looked 20 years old with crappy picture. ", 
    "My husband and I stayed there unplanned and were pleasantly surprised. The place was cool, trendy, and posh. We would definitely stay there again.", 
    "Reserved and paid six months in advance for 2 King Suite City View rooms for 3 nights each. Checked in and got 2 queen rooms no view at all. Inquired at front desk and was told to keep checking back and they would resolve when they could. Checked back the next morning, was told to come back later. Not wishing to ruin our trips, we just went to enjoy the city. I asked at check out for compensation for the difference in rooms, since they did in fact sell my rooms to someone else and was I offered $14.95 off entire bill. Offended, I asked for someone who was authorized to do more and was given an email address. A week later, no response, couldn't be more offended now. Paid for a steak, got chicken, and was basically told that while they were in fact very sorry, it's my tough luck that they oversold. Unacceptable! STAY AWAY.", 
    "This is by far the best hotel i been to in Chicago. Excellent staff , very nice people and the most awesomest 29th floor city view with a bar. I had the executive suite and it was amazing! Very clean , comfortable and modernized. Will definitely be stay here again. .... also A+ on valet parking! !", 
    "Hotel is conveniently located to shops, Navy pier, restaurants and public transportation. Staff were friendly and knowledgeable. "

  "swissotel": [
    "Booked this place last minute on expedia and was very thoroughly surprised. They gave us a corner room; we requested 2 double beds which they fulfilled; bathroom was wonderful, shower was luxurious, beds were comfortable and we got a great view of the river. Absolutely no complaints; location is perfect- walking distance to everything!", 
    "The Swissotel is a perfect place to stay in Chicago if you want to spoil yourself. The room is spacious and the king size bed was one of the most comfortable hotel beds I've ever stayed in. The staff were friendly and very helpful and were more than willing to recommend nearby restaurants and bars. It is right on the river with beautiful views and located right near a number of great places to eat. If I have 1 complaint, it is that at $15 for 24 hours, the wifi is frankly overpriced. Especially given that there is free wifi all around the area. Apart from that, it's hard to fault this hotel.", 
    "Would stay here again if in the Chicago area. Elevators were fast and efficient for such a large hotel. Room service was prompt and the food was fantastic. Comfy bed and warm, powerful shower. Absolutely fantastic.", 
    "It was a great location for my needs. To be close to a recently hospitalized family member.", 
    "A very nice place to stay in Chicago. Very nice workout area and pool. The room was extremely clean and quiet. ", 
    "Our stay was a stop over following a long flight. The hotel was within 15 - 20 minutes walk off the Blue Line metro train from O'Hare. We made use of the indoor pool on the 42nd floor. The views from up there, overlooking the Chicago skyline, were breathtaking. As we had an early morning train to catch from Union station we did not have time to try their breakfast. The cab ride to the station was $10, reflecting the distance and time of day. We would stay at this hotel again in the future.", 
    "I enjoyed the location of this hotel -- close by without being smack in the middle of the Miracle Mile area. The rooms felt quiet. I enjoyed the gym and the healthy feeling about the hotel. The breakfast buffet was an amazing array of great healthy eats with beautiful berries, yogurt and granola, plus really good eggs, waffles, etc..", 
    "Most comfortable bed ever. Nice view of the city and chicago river from room. Would stay again", 
    "I had a wonderful experience at the Swissotel and I totally appreciate their \"going green\" benefit. My room was comfortable and clean and the staff was extremely helpful. It is also well placed in downtown Chicago. I will be back! ", 
    "Once I received a swipe card that worked after standing in the hallway 20 min everything was ok. I called from 25 floor house phone and was told someone was on the way right away, 20 min later had to go down and get new card. I asked who I spoke too and of course no great surprise no one knew. Great hotel if the cared. ", 
    "The hotel is close to everything with only short taxi rides to your destination.", 
    "We arrived late Friday for the weekend. Our car was successful with the valet at the hotel. Spend the weekend visiting friends and meeting new people. Had a great experience. ", 
    "We used Expedia \"name your price\". Despite our early arrival, the desk clerk gave us immediate access in to our room and he also upgraded us to a room with a fabulous view of Lake Michigan, Navy Pier and surrounding high rises. Really nice since we were paying a discount rate. Staff was very cordial and helpful. The room was very nice and comfortable. The restaurants have very high prices Don't bother going to the Palm Restuarant. The prices are extremely high for entrees and don't even come with any sides. You have to pay quite a lot for the sides also. It's ridiculous.", 
    "Great will stay there again, very helpful, kind more than what I expected", 
    "I was told on checkin at 315 pm that there weren't any rooms available because they overbooked. She said she didnt know if any rooms would be available but I could upgrade and get a room immediately. She said I booked through a third party website unfortunately. I was stunned!!! We argued back and forth until I asked to speak to her manager. After waiting 10 min another lady came to the desk and got me a room. I just could not believe the way the check in was handled. ", 
    "Checked in very late and was greeted by friendly, professional staff. We were upgraded to a suite which was very nice and enhanced our stay greatly. We went out and came back quite late and again the staff was available and very helpful.", 
    "We used a private parking service at half price, instead the hotel Valet service. Room was clean, nice and quiet with a beautiful view over the Chicago river. The guy from the reception desk was not friendly, with a cold attitude. First impression always count. ", 
    "Really enjoyed the stay and proximity to the things we had planned. If only the Swissotel could control the outside temperature, it would be perfect. Will definitely stay there again!", 
    "Rude staff very uncomfortable. Stay felt i did not get my moneys worth. Told manager compensation. Was inadequate", 
    "I stayed at Swissotel with my mom for a small vacation. We both agreed that the hotel was one of our favorites, and we travel for mini get-aways at least once or twice per year. I requested a high floor and received a double room on the 40th floor with a beautiful view of Navy Pier. I don't think there is a hotel in Chicago with a more gorgeous view! The staff was professional and knowledgable. I enjoyed the pool on the 42nd floor - it was clean and warm while the temperature outside hit one degree. Truly a five star experience!", 
    "The room was quite comfortable. A docking station allowed me to play music using my iPhone. As a person who like to take baths, the separate tub and shower allowed my husband and I to get ready at the same time. On an especially frigid weekend, one of the best features of the hotel was that it is part of a pedway system. This allowed us to stay warm while accessing Michigan Avenue via a lower level walkway. Although I liked the elevator system (actually punching in your floor instead of just pressing an up or down button), at peak times the wait was very long.", 
    "Well maintained, very clean, inviting staff.", 
    "Stayed here for Valentines Day with my wife. Great view of the city and lake. There was a long line for checking in, which was a little annoying, but other than that it was a nice hotel. The room itself was clean, but it wasn't the most comfortable place I have stayed. The bed was too soft for me, but my wife enjoyed it. It was a very plain room, no art or pictures, but at least you have a great view. When I called to order room service, I was put on hold for about 10 minutes, but I can imagine they were pretty busy for valentines day. When I did get thru, the room service receptionist was very kind and didn't rush. We were told it would be 50 minutes for our food and it showed up in about 25, so that was a plus. Overall I would recommend this to anyone visiting downtown Chicago for a day or two.", 
    "Came for a one night getaway with the wife for Valentines Day. I used Spot Hero to save on valet parking costs. The hotel had no issues with that. I wanted to arrive early and drop off our bags, by noon but they had our room all ready for us. That was a pleasant surprise. I thought I ordered a King Corner room, but it turned out to be a standard King room. I didn't bother objecting since we had limited time before our appointment and we had a pretty good view of Navy Pier. Otherwise everything was very nice. I'd recommend a return visit if it wasn't so expensive.", 
    "We stayed at the Swisshotel 2/13. We overlooked Navy Pier and the city; the view was great. The room was beautiful and spacious. We will stay there again.", 
    "Was not happy with this stay this time. Hotel was crazy busy parking was nightmare in front to get valet and I asked for room away from elevators and we were right near them. Did not final staff at front desk overly friendly more like pretentious. We have stayed at a lot of nice places including Fountainbleau in Miami and many great hotels in Chicago. I just didn't like the vibe this time.", 
    "A nice Valentines getaway turned into a frigid experience because our room had NO HEAT the entire stay! The engineers had to be called 3 times and in the end, they said they couldn't move us because they had no other rooms available, but when we went on their website, we saw they had more suites available. When I asked about why we couldn't be moved to one of those, they replied it was because we booked through a 3rd party (hotels.com). I went down to the desk 3 times to complain, but the front desk had no response other than to disappear in the back and do nothing! So our room got down to 62 degrees and we bundled up and rode out the experience. Room service got our order wrong twice so our food took over 90 min to get. And I was promised a call back to our room from the front desk manager, twice, and they never called at all. I can't ever remember receiving such poor customer service from any hotel, regardless of star level. Very disappointing and it completely ruined our Valentines Day so I am going to book somewhere else to have us get a redo....", 
    "Me and my husband stayed at this hotel 2/14/15 for a romantic getaway and it was prefect the room service was pricey but overall the room was clean , food was excellent, and hotel staff was amazing as well . We're going to be visiting again very soon. ", 
    "The stay was great except housekeeping came in really early on Saturday (before 9am) They knocked once and just entered the room while I was having intercourse. Then she proceeded to ask me when would be a good time to come back. That was really uncomfortable and embarrassing for my girl.", 
    "Beware: at breakfast, you will spend $7-$10 for a beverage. Not something with alcohol in it, simply juice from concentrate. Parking is another nightmare. The Valet will charge $67/night, whereas self-parking is $37/night. Little hidden scams are just built in everywhere. Everything is mediocre is very overpriced--we went once, and will never go back. I forwarded my concerns to management and got the whole: \"I understand, there's nothing we can do.\" It's best to just stay at a place where the customer comes first and they are more transparent about their added costs. The gym, however, is actually amazing for a hotel.", 
    "Room is clean. Very very nice window views. Staff is very polite. Not a huge deal but air conditioning in the premier room needs improvements though. There are 2 vents in the room and each has a thermostat. Those thermostats sync together. However, one vent was blowing out warm air while another one was blowing out cool air. Unfortunately the vent blowing out cool air was next to the bed. Thus we always felt cold even the thermostats were set to 80.", 
    "We stayed here one night while visiting my daughter who attends school downtown Chicago. We had friends who really like this hotel and decided to try it.", 
    "The hotel is fancy and in a nice area. The room was dated, the outlets are buried and half of them do not work. The linens and towels are stiff and scratchy. There is mold in the bathroom. The hotel does everything for you: park your car, take care of your bags, meals. The staff is very happy to help (except for the bell captain) and charges a kings ransom for each service.", 
    "I really want to give a perfect rating but to find the hotel was impossible! Luckily the staff was over the top nice. Room was amazing, view amazing. No complaints except the parking garage and finding the hotel. Really enjoyed this hotel.", 
    "Had to change my reservation just before checking in. The hotel staff was very accommodating. The hotel itself reminds me of a new-age roman fusion. White-wash walls in the lobby area highlighted with different colored lights. While there, I made use of the restaurant attached. ", 
    "Quiet relaxing stay. However you should not charge for wi-fi.", 
    "Excellent hotel, modern furnishings, comfortable beds, spacious. I would love to stay here again in the future.", 
    "Great place with great facilities. The one gripe is that you have to pay for wifi in your room and even for a toothbrush and toothpaste if you forgot yours. ", 
    "Great stay -- modern, clean, nice hotel with good overall location and great views.", 
    "Please use fitted sheets which hold the padding and bottom sheet in place. ", 
    "It was a beautiful hotel. Elegant, yet up to date. ", 
    "This was our first time to Chicago- a weekend away from the kids with my husband. We decided to take a cab to the hotel from O-Hare and it was $40 plus tip. It was easy and worth it to get there quickly in about 20 minutes in no traffic at 8:30 PM on a Friday night. The train was only $5 per person, but the station is a bit of a walk from the hotel so we opted not to do that. We thought we might take the train on the way home, but it was snowing and quite cold, so we opted to do the cab again- same fare and quick drive. As far as the Swissotel, it has a nice lobby and check in was easy. I reserved and paid for the deluxe room with king (did not pay for lake view), but our room had a beautiful lake view with Navy Pier and the river on the 14th floor. It was a nice surprise and a fun view with the ferris wheel lit up at night and the lights on the dock, plus the skycraper lights, street lights, river walk lights, lit up trees, and vibe of the city. I want to thank the front desk for doing that! The room was very, very clean. It showed some wear on the walls, but honestly it was very nice. Nice carpet and bedding. The bathroom was also very clean. There is a Keurig and they give you 2 k-cups each day. The pool was not as nice as I expected. We did not use it. The view from the 42nd floor there was nice. Overall, I would recommend. You need to take a cab around the city...it's a long, cold walk in January. FYI- cab fares add up! ", 
    "Love it; everything about it was great. The location was perfect, and for that location - it's a bit of a premium, but well worth it.", 
    "Upon check in, I sat in my car 5 minutes before being approached by valet. Valet was $65 dollars which is a bit pricey. At check-in, the front desk clerk was extremely rude and very unhelpful. He explained to me that I would be charged additionally for using the pool even though I was a guest for the night. I also inquired about a promo online to upgrade my room and even though the hotel had several rooms available, he insisted that I could not upgrade. The hotel room was a bit dusty and basic. The was little entertainment offered by the hotel compared to many othe hotels near by. I was definitely disappointed. ", 
    "Premiere Corner King was Amazing! View was great! I definitely recommend this hotel! ", 
    "Came here for the Cubs Convention weekend and don't have any regrets about staying here rather than the Sheraton! It was a quick walk across the river. When we checked in, we were given a nice lakefront view without request. The room is impressive in size, as well as the bathroom. The staff is extremely friendly and attentive. They make you feel special. The elevator system is really cool and works well - you never have to wait for the elevator. All in all, probably one of the nicest hotels I have ever stayed at.", 
    "The staff greeted us with a friendly smile, let us know where we could find everything in the hotel. When we called the front desk with questions, always were treated nicely. Room was clean, view was awesome!! Room service was good (a little pricey, but something we don't do often so it was a fun treat). When our son told the gentleman delivering the room service that it was his 4th birthday, he returned a short time later with two large cookies and a jar of M&M's asking if the birthday boy could have a treat. Check out was easy and the woman that checked us in the day before remembered our son's name which is nice. Very excellent staff and service- we will return and recommend this hotel.", 
    "Love this hotel. Stayed there many times. Recently renovated Lobby and elevators. Nice. Always love to go to the top and work out in their health club. What a super view!", 
    "Great hotel", 
    "The hotel was in the perfect location for our needs on this trip. The rooms were spacious but the beds were small (would have really appreciated queens). Staff was friendly & attentive, especially Kurtis @ the front desk! Will stay again if planning to travel to this area again.", 
    "Second stay at the Swissotel. Great location. Great city/lake views. Courtesy and professional staff. ", 
    "While the room was nice I find it a little pricy. For breakfast it would have been $56.00 plus tip. The bath towels were rough. the wi-fi was not free. The TV was had to work since you had to go back to the menu to change channels. The last morning the coffee maker did not work.", 
    "This hotel is well located and walking distance to many of the cities finest attractions. I would stay there again.", 
    "Nice hotel Lamp in desk did not work and the complimentary coffee in the room was all decaf.", 
    "Stay was ok but the valet service was horrible. I paid $65 dollars to have my car valeted and when I got my car back the next day I was missing one of my center caps on my car. It was on my car when I arrived and gone when I left. I called and left the general manager a message on Friday 1/2/15, and I have not received a return call as of 1/6/15 from him. It is ridiculous that I spend that kind of money for a their service only to have one of their employees steal from me.", 
    "We stayed in the city for new years with the kids so we were looking for something downtown, but not too busy with a decent pool. Be warned, since we weren't, that management likes to close the pool early on New Years, so our two teary eyed toddlers were denied swim before bedtime even though we showed up well before the posted 10PM close. Otherwise a clean quiet midrange hotel with some decent breakfast options within walking distance. Near the loop and mang mile, but far enough away from the hustle bustle and traffic. Nice views of the lake and city.", 
    "Definitely will stay here next time I sm I Chicago!", 
    "After booking though Expedia the hotel desk agent said it would take an hour for our reservation to hit their system so we sat in the lobby for an hour waiting even though Expedia confirmed us to check in 15 minutes after booking. She told us she would call us over when she gets our reservation but she never did. When we went to check in,our reservations were effectively in the system,seemed like it was in the system immediately before the hour. She never called us over like she claimed. Once we got our room key,we were happy to check out the room and views. The room does not have a blow dryer,which doesn't work well for my wife and our son with long hair. The rooms seemed older as well. The views were beautiful but only if your standing or sitting directly in front of the window. You can't see the magnificent view from our bed. After we decided to stay another night (due to convenience of being settled in) and booked online. We kept getting disturbances from housekeeping who constantly came in the room unnotified several times until 9 pm,waking up our 3 year old. Overall,I've had better experiences at nearby hotels. Their pool and hot tub was great. ", 
    "ok", 
    "The Swissotel was a nice hotel, but I expected a little more. We stayed in a corner room on the 14th floor, and the views were mostly of the building next to us, with a few peeks at the river and such. Our room had no coffee maker and the price of water was outrageous. Plus, there is a $7 delivery fee for anything they bring to you. We requested a few plates and glasses, and yes, there was a $7 delivery fee! Nothing was complimentary, or at least we did not know of anything that may have been complimentary. The check-in staff was not very informative. Overall, it is a nice hotel, but for the price, there are much better options.", 
    "Overall we had a nice stay during the New Years Eve holidays. The hotel had a great location for viewing the fireworks over the lake and a short distance to the Millennium Park and Magnificent Mile shopping area. ", 
    "The hotel was fabulous and we loved the location. Conveniently located in downtown Chicago. Spacious rooms and bathroom.", 
    "My first time visiting the Swiss was very warm relaxing, friendly staff ..great view spacious rooms .. All I can say I love my visit & will be bk..;)", 
    "I didn't like that I was told about the $100 incident charge and after I checked out the customer rep told me it takes a week to get it back on my credit card that is outrageous. Also maid pushed the bell and ran away. The Palm Restaurant was seriously overpriced and the food quality didn't justify the price. The waiter service was terrible.", 
    "Wonderful!!!", 
    "Great hotel. Staff helpful and friendly. Room nice size, clean and quiet. Paid extra for room with river, lake and city views and was worth it! Wonderful workout room and pool. Great restaurants in and around hotel. This hotel has it all. Book it, you won't be disappointed!", 
    "Nice but for the price would have expected more.", 
    "Really disappointed. The hotel had a lot of potential but the room was not clean.", 
    "Enjoyed our stay over the Christmas Holiday. Very quiet, staff friendly. A suggestion: it would have been nice to have a small coffee maker in our room to make a cup of coffee without having to get dressed and go down to the lower level to get a cup from Starbucks.", 
    "Had a great New Years experience withy the family into the new year, great facility at reasonable rates.", 
    "Very professional and clean. Worth the price. Rooms are amazing with some having a gorgeous view of the city. Definitely going back again. Perfect location also. Staff was amazing and very helpful. Checked in and out with ease. The beds are beyond comfortable ! ", 
    "Great facilities and staff with a lot of amenities. ", 
    "Not bad at all but not impressive,either. A bit old building so it's not super clean, but the room definitely was spacious and the staffs were kind.", 
    "Very disorganized and overpriced meal experience for breakfast in the Hotel restaurant. Know that there is a Dunkin' Donuts in the basement of the building next-door connected underground.", 
    "This isn't my first time at this hotel. Hotel is modern, clean, quiet, staff is very accommodating, standard room is spacious compared to similarly priced hotels and the indoor pool is great. There was only one problem, which is a big one...the room was so hot (December) we couldn't sleep. I was there with my kids, and it wasn't any fun to be staring at one another at 2 AM because we were too hot to sleep. Unfortunately for me, the negative outweighs the positive for me to stay there again. Especially when there are so many other choices in Chicago.", 
    "Terrific experience, except I was very surprised and disappointed there was not complimentary coffee in the room or downstairs in the lobby. Kind of surprising for a 4 star hotel to lack this perk.", 
    "Toilet handle was broken . The vent in bathroom was filthy covered in dirt about a1/4 inch deep. The handle on the ice bucket broke.- We sent most of day at wedding and tv remote did not work properly. Will not stay here again. Had not stayed here in last two years but use to stay already 3 times a year", 
    "Very clean, beautiful hotel. Loved it.", 
    "The room, hotel, and spa were all great. We loved the location as it had access to an underground walkway to Michigan Avenue. This was really nice to avoid the cold winter weather for at least a couple of blocks. The bed was super uncomfortable. Both my husband and I woke up every morning with aching backs.", 
    "Very clean rooms, amenities such as robes and bottled water, comfortable bed with lots of pillows, and great service.", 
    "Very nice location near the south end of the Magnificent Mile. We had a great view of Navy Pier. The Swissotel has the nicest workout area of any of the 15-20 hotels we've stayed at in Chicago. Friendly staff and nice, large (but not upscale) rooms. We got a great rate for two night near Christmas. ", 
    "I didn't realize that coffee and microwave were not included in the room. Also, the receptionist didn't relate what restaurants were in the hotel. She was very dry. Restaurant was very expensive. Could easily get more for my money elsewhere in the city. Bathroom had crackers on the floor. Not a family friendly hotel..", 
    "Very pleased with the customer service, from the valet parking lot attendants to the service counter clerks. The hotel was clean and very beautiful. The view from our corner room was phenomenal. We were able to see the city and Lake Michigan. The view of Navy Pier at night was breathtakingly beautiful. The restaurant downstairs had a great menu to choose from and was tasty.", 
    "Great location, great view, great amenities, good service. This was a repeat visit. There were a few smaller issues with the room, but they got taken care of immediately when we reported them.", 
    "My husband and I just stayed at this hotel the weekend before Christmas to do a little shopping on Michigan Avenue. This was a great location to walk to many of the local attractions. The staff was extremely friendly and helpful and the hotel is beautiful! Very clean and spacious rooms.", 
    "Great hotel - only complaint is that rooms do not have a micro and none are available to the public anywhere in the hotel. Management refused to assist in heating up food for my 2 year old grandchild. We were told there was no micros due to health concerns. We believe it is because the hotel views this as a way to force room service.", 
    "Gorgeous hotel that is in a great part of Chicago. Close enough to so many restaurants and attractions. I would definitely recommend it. ", 
    "From arrival to check out, the experience was wonderful. The hotel was elegant yet home-like. The staff were friendly and very knowledgeable about the city and the best places for food and fun. Looking forward to our next stay.", 
    "We got in late and the room was ready and clean, different from our previous hotel in NY. The staff was friendly and attentive. ", 
    "Loved everything, but no coffee maker in the room is just crazy. I'm guessing that was to make you go to the lobby and pay $5 for a Starbucks. ", 
    "had an issue getting our car out of vallet, they ran my card so many times back to back it locked up my card. We spent an hour trying to rectify everything. They were nice about it but it shouldn't have happened.", 
    "Great location, great facility, great service. Highly recommend and will stay there again when I return to Chicago.", 
    "I am from Chicago, and I wanted to get a room for my birthday as a treat for myself. I wanted a nice King Bed, good views of the city, and a pool with a hot tub. I got a Corner King Room on expedia. When I got there, the concierge noticed it was my birthday, which is nice. He claimed a Corner King on the 4th floor was the only one left. I can't recall exactly my response but I made it clear that was disappointing for me. After two minutes of him clicking around on the computer, he said he found a corner king suite, and he would give it to me. I was very happy to get the upgrade. The room was better than I expected it would be, 3304. The best thing is the view. It looked over Lake Michigan, Navy Pier, the river, and some downtown area, including the Trump Tower. There \"may\" be better views out there, but this was awesome and breath taking, and was 100% satisfied with the view. It was actually a foggy day and I still was impressed. The room had two bathrooms, a living area with a tv, a separate bedroom with a tv and with window, and another bathroom with a separate tub and shower. The bed was great, very comfortable. The room would impress anyone I know. It has all the bells and whistles one could expect for a hotel to have. It's not clear to me if they charge for internet or not or pool access, but they didn't charge me. ", 
    "Each year for our anniversary we spend a few days in the city to get away, celebrate and do a little shopping. Our stay with you was wonderful! Our room had a spectacular view, and the bed was heavenly. My only complaint: no coffee machine in the room.", 
    "We loved the room and fitness area. The pool and hot tub were great except that there was some type of accident on the last day and both were drained so we didn't get the chance to go in either on our last day.", 
    "A first-rate and very comfortable hotel, friendly and helpful staff, just the right scale, a good range of quality services without being overwhelming, very well-located. Fantastic beds and we enjoyed the room lighting. Coming back every night felt like coming home. Located on the River, a couple of blocks from the Magnificent Mile and walking distance, even in bad weather, to good restaurants, shops and attractions. Our room overlooked the River, the Navy Pier and the Lake, so we had a sense of openness and nature -- sun and light and air. We felt close to everything but not trapped in a big city. Maid, doorman, concierge and restaurant staff all went out of their way to help us.", 
    "The only negative I can think of is we experienced problems with the tv", 
    "Beautiful hotel! Great location, lovely views, comfortable bed....fantastic experience! Will stay again!", 
    "Nice, nothing extraordinary. No free wifi in the rooms. Gym and facilities very nice though.", 
    "I have stayed at this hotel before and it was excellent as usual. Comfortable rooms with great views and a great location. Easy to walk to Michigan Ave shopping and attractions. Easy to drive or take cab anywhere else you might want to go. I will definitely stay here again. Thanks", 
    "Just a note that parking is a little steep at $65 a night.", 
    "Can't beat the centralized location to not only the Mag Mile but State Street and Millenium Park as well. Pay the small up charge for a lake view - you will not be disappointed! Rooms are large but missing a coffee machine - don't know what you've got until it's gone! Small complaint however on an excellent hotel!", 
    "The hotel is centrally located close to the new Maggie Daley Park, and within walking distance to many other attractions", 
    "The room was excellant. The bed very comfortable. I liked that the bathroom had both a tub and a separate shower. We ate at two of the restaurants and they both were delicious.", 
    "Checked in late at night for our anniversaryand the lady who assigned the room couldn't have been nicer. Went to Amuse for a drink and the barkeep was a jerk. Up in the room, the toilet was filling every minute or so. Called down to switch rooms before we unpacked and all they could do was send a man up. He worked on it a while and said that was all he could do. At 2am it started running again. I called the desk to say I was going to turn off the water supply to get some sleep but expected something done in the a.m. Ruby said she would leave a note for the morning staff. After a great breakfast in the Geneva restaurant with truly professional staff we asked and the concierge seemed more concerned with what she couldn't do than with fixing it. I asked for the manager and was told he was busy. When Jeff got free he offered to switch our room. His smile was plastic and his tone patronizing, but full marks for being the one person there who stopped making excuses and fixed it. He offered us free drinks in Amuse, I hope not as a further insult but rather because he doesn't know how bad his night barkeeper's attitude is. The new room had plumbing with a slow trickle instead of the on/off filling. We closed the door and that quieted it enough to sleep. 2 rooms, 2 leaks--I wonder how much water is being wasted through poor maintenance. Lee shoved a note under the door that apologized for the issues and wished me a \"happy birthday.\" Did not meet expectations.", 
    "This was one of the most amazing hotels I have ever stayed at. Incredible views, close to everything, and the room and staff were so great. I will stay here again and absolutely recommend to my friends and family!!", 
    "Swissotel has recently undergone changes. The coffee service in the room is not available. Bad idea!", 
    "This is my second stay in this hotel and definitely not my last. In Chicago, it's hard to tell whether you're paying for quality or location. But with Swissotel, you get both for a fair price. The beds are comfortable, the decor is updated, the water pressure in the shower is great. Unfortunately in my most recent room, the cabinet door was off one of the hinges and the handle on the shower door was a little loose. Other than those minor flaws, my stay was next to perfect.", 
    "Surprised to find that the beds in our room for 3 were full instead of queen. It all worked out and we had a great time", 
    "roomy, well appointed rooms. Nice ambiance in lobby and bar, great downtown locale.", 
    "great hotel, wonderful, helpful staff, beautiful conference room on the 40th floor, where food and service was excellent.", 
    "Great corner room with great view. Nice amenities and convenient to conference.", 
    "All in all, a good hotel. But I have two complaints: 1. I called prior to booking and was told they had coffee in the room. 2. There is no station guide on the television and it has very limited channels.", 
    "The front desk staff lacked a certain level of professionalism that I've received during previous stays.", 
    "We booked 3 rooms for our family, so quite expensive, but your prices were reasonable... thanks! They said check in was at 3, but when I arrived after 3, some rooms weren't ready. The clerk worked hard to find 3 rooms we could move into on the same floor and upgraded us to lake view. We appreciated that. Two rooms were ready and the third one needed cleaning still. We moved into the two rooms and she quickly brought us the key for the third room. I regret to say that after all that work.... the third room needed the sheets changed and the bathroom cleaned still AFTER we moved in. I asked the desk to please clean the room while we were out that evening. They did clean it. Other than the initial delays, they accommodated us well.", 
    "I usually always enjoy my stay at this hotel, it's beautiful, there's great dining and I live the spa. This particular time was no different from that, just unusual. There was a water bottle top under the desk and the flash handle on the toilet was broken, really had to jiggle and play with it to work. It was minor so I didn't complain but I was disappointed to see this from this type of high end hotel.", 
    "Overall very nice hotel...but the feather bed was so awful, I actually had scratches from the protruding feathers on my hands, feet, and ankles! :-(", 
    "Dirty tub and broken ice machine on my floor, but the views were amazing.", 
    "Great Stay!!", 
    "Girls weekend was great! Beds were so comfy, room was clean, bathroom was clean and spacious. Would stay again. They do put a $100 hold on your credit card for incidentals and may forget to tell you that.", 
    "Very nice hotel and its been kept up. Nice sized bathroom and plenty of space overall. But I learned a lesson on cost here. I expect when I pay $250 for a room that parking shouldn't be over 60, and at least a continental breakfast should be complimentary. Unfortunately we had some very loud folks in the room next to us and even after warned they got even louder. It took a couple of hours for hotel customer service to get the party stopped in the room next door. I wouldn't say that it ruined my stay but I can attest to some very thin walls between the rooms and even though the hotel knew of the noise issue they didn't offer to comp us anything. To top it off the next morning we called down for our car to be brought around and they told us it would be 20 minutes. It was over 1 hour. That's unacceptable in any case and even worse with a baby. The hotel is quick to charge you to use the internet or park your car but when they don't follow through on their end it is disappointing. Instead of staying in a 100$ hotel a half hour away I wanted to give my family a great experience. Instead, sadly, we left frustrated and disappointed.", 
    "Given the occasion I wanted something special and grown up. The room was certainly nice, but not luxurious or special.", 
    "Parking way to high hotel next door cheaper so that's very inconvenient!!!", 
    "Great hotel minimal waits on elevators and minimal traffic", 
    "Great hotel upgrade room nice view Recommend highly", 
    "The staff was friendly, the hotel was clean and well priced in a good location close to Michigan Ave. Unfortunately we got a room that had a terrible mattress with a black hole you fell in to. other than the bed I would highly recommend this hotel for a stay in Chicago.", 
    "We have stayed at the Swissotel many times over the past decade. The hotel is clean and efficient with excellent service. The rooms are very comfortable with premium bedding and comfortable beds. Views are very good, even after the neighborhood has grown up around it. Our favorite hotel in Chicago despite several stays at more expensive facilities.", 
    "awesome location. room view had river on one side sights of millennium park and lake Michigan on the other....beautiful", 
    "Wonderful time , great staff, great bar , beautiful views,and location is awesome. ", 
    "Location was perfect, the view from our 4th floor room was fantastic. Hotel staff was friendly, attentive, and helpful. The concierge set up dining, entertainment, and suggested the perfect places for us to enjoy the night life as three single women. So many great locations and activities within walking distance, taxi service for the others. We always felt safe. The pedway connected to the hotel was perfect for accessing other hotels and businesses without stepping out into the super cold weather. My only wish would have been a microwave and coffee pot in the room. We could have enjoyed leftovers from the fantastic but large meals, and hot tea without going down to the bar. I would recommend the Swissotel to anyone and would stay there again.", 
    "Hotel is excellent overall, but the room service bill left a sour taste for me. I travel frequently and order room service all the time, so I know what is reasonable and what is outrageus. For dinner, I ordered a burger and pot of coffee. I was charged $40.24 on check out. They said there's a $5 delivery charge, plus 20% gratuity, plus tax. Excessive. And the delivery and gratuity were not on the bill that I signed for when the food was delivered to my room. And if I had known about the automatic gratuity, I would not have tipped the waiter $5. Same thing for breakfast next morning (eggs benedict + pot of coffee = $41.54). Very sneaky. Beware.", 
    "Dated. Needs upgrade. Good service.", 
    "I stayed here by default as my favorite and frequent choices did not have availability. I have two fundamental issues with this hotel. Recognizing staying in downtown Chicago is an expensive proposition to begin with for the price paid would it really be all that difficult to provide free Wi-Fi and coffee in the rooms. I personally consider both of these base services in todays environment and to have to pay extra for Wi-Fi and room service to get a cup of coffee is simply being too cheap and trying to max how much of my wallet I leave behind. Specific to my room the heating/cooling system was quite a constant noise which bordered beyond \"white\" noise for the room although it meant you heard nothing else.", 
    "When we were checking in our host ZEE aksed if we were there for a special occasion. When I informed her that we were celebrating my wife's birthday she checked availability and upgraded us to a suite with a view of Navy Pier and Lake Michigan. It was beautiful. Great accomodations and staff, great location, great amenities, great time!", 
    "Fantastic getaway with my wife. Great hotel in a perfect location.", 
    "Excellent accommodations. Excessively pricey for bar/drinks/pool etc.", 
    "fees for use of the pool and fitness center fees for internet access towels were dirty with crust on them", 
    "I've only ever stayed in a Corner King so I can't comment to the other rooms, and I love them. The bathroom in any hotel room shouldn't be close to where you sleep (unless you're handicapped) along with the size, that's what I like most. Nice clean comfortable bed, tv with a guide, and a spacious bathroom with all the extras you may need.", 
    "Expected more comfortable bed. Arm chair wasn't clean. Shower slab could have been cleaner", 
    "The hotel is perfectly located for both shopping and sightseeing. Michigan Ave is an easy walk. The room is clean, comfortable and spacious. The staff was profession, friendly and eager to make our stay memorable.", 
    "Staff was pleasant but I was told to pay for Wi Fi and they would then deduct it from my hotel bill. They didn't . If I hadn't caught it I would have been charged. Hotel bar is too expensive , Service is poor, and they close too early ", 
    "Beautiful room with spectacular view of the lake and river. Very clean and comfortable. Would definitely stay again.", 
    "They gave us a free room upgrade without even asking. Great Lake,Navy Pier and downtown view from our corner room.", 
    "Everyone was very nice. The location isn't bad. The beds are not comfortable at all. Update the beds to memory foam or something, for $300 a night I sort of was left wanting more in terms of comfort. Also the room was roasting hot, even with the thermostat turned down to 65 it was very hot. ", 
    "Great staff, friendly and responsive The hotel is centerly located, you do not need transportion. The room over looks the lack.", 
    "Positive experience, room was generous in size. The hotel is ideally situated close to downtime and overlooking the lake . Hotel staff courteous and knowledgable - able to advise and recommend on restaurants, locations and places to get to ", 
    "Great place to stay but the food is way to expensive. The room service is the worst I have ever had. Took one and a half hours both time we ordered to eat in our room.Don't eat in the hotel.", 
    "Very pleased with all aspects of our stay. The rooms were modern looking and very comfortable. ", 
    "I came to Chicago to attend a SHRM sponsored training event. This hotel was a suggestion made by the organization. The hotel was very comfortable and inviting and was located very close to the areas I wanted to visit. Great location and staff!", 
    "Had a great river view. One downside was no in-room coffee maker.", 
    "Staff was welcoming, attentive and friendly. Very good food in the hotel. Many great things to do and see near by.", 
    "Came to Chicago for the Historic All Blacks vs. Eagles game.... The hotel is amazing and so close to everything.... Stay here to enjoy the beautiful city and the Magnificent Mile.... Chicago is an amazing city and staying here is the cherry on the top! ", 
    "Staff were very helpful. Let us check in at 9:00 AM. Good recommendations for restaurants and concierge made reservations without hesitation. Will go back there.", 
    "The hotel was great. First time in Chicago so the location was convenient and the view of the river was excellent. Valet was a bit pricey @ 65/night but parking in Chicago was expensive everywhere. Bathroom was nice but the fan never cut off for some reason. Customer service was excellent and very friendly. ", 
    "Requested room cleaning was not carried out, then came the poor excuses", 
    "Came to spend some time with my girlfriend, it was unforgettable to say the least. The room, the view, the location was amazing. Thank you swissotel for an awesome time.", 
    "I had a very nice stay at this hotel. However, there were two things that bothered my friend and I: 1) There was no coffee maker in the room. My friend and I figured that the Starbucks in the lobby would make less money if there WAS a coffee maker in the room. My friend likes herbal tea and even brought her own bags to enjoy early in the morning. She got charged $6.00 for a cup of herbal tea at the Starbucks. That's ridiculous. 2) WiFi is an extra charge unless you join Swissotel's \"club\". This hotel, from what I can tell, is mostly business and I think that's price gouging to charge for WiFi. Other than those two things, I had an enjoyable stay with an amazing view of Chicago!", 
    "This was one of the best hotels in Chicago. We loved the neighborhood as well. The front desk person, Rachel was super helpful and most accommodating to us.", 
    "Great gym! Toilet kept running in my room. Nice restaurant.", 
    "A very nice property and stands up to the ratings that it receives.", 
    "Overall a good hotel. Staff were very helpful. Pool and fitness area were good with a wonderful view as on the 42nd floor. Beds very comfortable.", 
    "We were there for the Chicago Marathon and it was within walking distance to the start line. ", 
    "Outrageous parking fees & hours wait at registration for very high overall room rate when parking at nearly every restaurant is $14 for entire evening and even overnight as another guest experienced. Many other alternatives makes this a last consideration vs first next time!", 
    "Having stayed at the Swissotel and a number of other hotels in the vicinity including Palomar, Fairmont Ritz carlton only this hotel will demand a drivers license (despite a credit card with a picture) which they then record in the system. Much to ones consternation because none of these companies (whether that be target or Home Depot or J.P. Morgan or Swissotel) be trusted with securing our personal information. Furnishings are from the last decade and in need of a makeover.", 
    "We had a great experience at the Swissotel! The hotel was a little hard to find because of Upper v. Lower Wacker, but once we stopped paying attention to the GPS and just used street signs we found it. Great walking distance to The Mile and Soldier Field, resturants, parks, etc. The room was spacious and clean, very nice clean bathroom. We had room service for breakfast and the food was good too. Overall a very positive experience. We would stay for a weekend again!", 
    "Nice hotel and great location downtown. Upper floors are quiet and room was spacious. Only improvements I would recommend is new beds - mine seemed older and there was a thin cotton \"blanket\" on top of the mattress, rather than a pad. Since they don't use fitted sheets we had to fix the bedding at night and in the morning. Loved that they had the option to skip housekeeping for a $5.00 daily credit at the restaurants/bar, but would rather have it be a room credit in general. Internet in the room is overpriced.", 
    "Great Hotel, great place, on the river and close to Michigan Ave and all places aroud (Sears tower, Hook tower, beaches, millenium park), however Wifi in not free", 
    "Beautiful hotel and we were lucky enough to have a wonderful view of the lake and navy pier. Our concierge that checked us in could have been more friendly, but all the others helping guest seemed to be more than welcoming. The spa was nice, but over priced for the service provided. It was a bit choppy and mechanical instead of relaxing. ", 
    "This was our second time staying at the Swissotel because we had such a great experience the first time. The staff is always great and the beds are the most comfortable hotel beds I have ever slept on. This time we were put in a beautiful corner unit with views of both the lake and river.", 
    "Overall, I absolutely love it and will be back but not with as many people. I had called ahead to ask if I could get a cot to accommodate the 4 people in the room with double beds. I was told yes. But when I arrived and found no extra 1 cot and called to request one, I was told that was not possible because it was fire hazard to have a cot in the room. i asked for extra linen so the one person could sleep on the floor and after a long 45 minute wait, they brought up a few items. We winded up taking the comforter from one bed to place on the floor to make it somewhat comfortable.", 
    "Great beds, great staff, very clean, beautiful view. The valet service was not helpful and it made for a stressful time finding parking. The room was so great. We were surprised at how hot it got, but the fan was not very strong, and after 2 hot showers, the room was very warm! Didn't matter for the over all positivity of the stay. We would stay again!", 
    "It was a good experience. The staff made the arrangements easy, and worry free.", 
    "I was passing through Chicago on a trip with my boyfriend. The hotel was great. Centrally located in the loop right btwn Millennium Park and the Mag Mile shopping area. The views of the river and lake are exceptional. The staff was very efficient and friendly. My only complaint is they charge extra for in-room internet and for access to the fitness center. At the prices they charge it should be included. The hotel is nice, but not that nice.", 
    "Have stayed here before, enjoyed it again!", 
    "When we arrived, we were greeted by nobody! I had to walk over the valet stand and ask them to valet my car even though I was parked right in front of them. Not that big of a deal but if you want my business then at least try a little since valet cost $65. Once I entered the hotel and got to the counter the women who helped me was very nice. Here was her mistake. I had told the hotel when I booked the room that it was my anniversary and I wanted a room with a king bed. That is all I asked for. So, when I checked in, the woman asked if I wanted to upgrade for $80, I said no thank you. As soon as I said no, she said well I already upgraded you for your anniversary. Whoa, so you upgraded me but then you were going to try and make me pay for it. What happened to doing the little things for the customer so that they returned to your hotel. I left irritated but grabbed my bags and my wife and I went up to the room on the 10th floor where we stayed. The door was all scratched up and so heavy my wife couldn't push through it. The carpet in the room was pulling up in the middle and the comforter was stained slightly. There were smudges on the remote and the bathroom floor hadn't been vacuumed. The shower door also leaks if water hits the crack which causes water to be all over the floor when you get out which my wife slipped in. Overall, I felt like this hotel had some nice features like restaurants and its right on Wacker so location is good, but I was not satisfied.", 
    "Fabulous expriencewith this beautiful Hotel. Unfortunately, we didnt have the lake's view but the location and comfort is fantastic. The cost was reasonable, as well.", 
    "The room was a nice size with lots of amenities. There was a huge bathtub separate from the shower in the bathroom which was really nice after a day of walking. Nice view of the Chicago River out our window and the skyline lite up at night.", 
    "This is the second time we have stayed at the Swiss Hotel. We were in town for a college football game. When we arrived at the hotel at 11 am, we had planned to just leave our bags as check-in was at 3 pm. But we were able to check-in and take our bags to our room before the football game. AWESOME!!! Staff is very warm and welcoming. Hotel is spotless. Group we traveled with really enjoyed their stay as well. Location is excellent for shopping and dining. We will be back again. ", 
    "Loved how fast the check in and check out process was. Loved the amount of towels and comfort in bed.", 
    "We arrived late morning and were able to check in which was a huge plus. Terrific hotel...highly recommend.", 
    "Beautiful hotel with excellent amenities and friendly staff. Room had fantastic view of the city, Chicago River and Lake Michigan. ", 
    "Overall I was very happy with the stay, the staff was great, the room was clean, the mattress was fantastic. I have two small issues, the hot water wasn't very hot and the pipes were noisy when the hot water was on. I was also dissapointed that there were no in room coffee makers, for the daily rate of the room I shouldn't have to pay another $3-$5 and go to the lobby for some coffee. Beyond these two issue I would stay at the property again no question.", 
    "We requested the harbor view corner king room and were told it would be ready for us when we arrived for our checkin at 3 pm but when we arrived it was not ready. They had another room available but not the one we requested. If it was not possible to have it ready by the time we arrived, I would have appreciated just being told that over the phone instead of arriving and then having to wait 2 hours for that room to become available. The front desk told us 45 minutes but it took much longer. We were only staying one night as well so I felt it was a waste of my time and money to have to wait for the room. If i was just told it wouldnt be ready, I would have just taken a different room. Other than that, our stay was great. The hotel is really nice, very clean and the staff is very nice too.", 
    "Always a positive experience. Rooms are large, updated and clean.", 
    "Excelente", 
    "It was wonderful! We had the best view of the Chicago River and Navy Pier. Unexpected half price for valet parking because I drove a hybrid vehicle. Close to Michigan Ave for shopping and dining, and waking distance to the attractions at Navy Pier.", 
    "Great night! We are from Chicago and rented a room for our 1-year anniversary. The host upgraded us to a room with a better view free of charge. The room-service and staff friendliness were outstanding.", 
    "A lovely hotel with comfortable well designed rooms and great views of the city. Elevators are fast and love the Starbucks in the lobby. My only problem: I was attending a conference at the Sheraton right across the river. To get there with a suitcase from the Swissotel, you must take a metal staircase down about 4 flights to get to the Columbus bridge. Surely, there's a way to take an elevator to Lower Wacker, through parking lot perhaps, to get across the river more easily. The check-in desk was not well organized, hard to know which clerks were open and I waited a while only to have others who had come up after me get service first. A simple rope line would help there. Otherwise a very nice stay.", 
    "A bath tab is good for me. I could take a bath and be relaxed.", 
    "Hotel is very nice. Very nice rooms. Close to mag mile and millennium park. Great location, great views, wonderful staff.", 
    "Bad customer service from front desk!", 
    "I stayed in a corner room for 1 night for a personal event. The hotel was all right but a little pricey especially when it comes room service and parking. I took one look at the menu and said no way. One issue i had was how long it took to check in the hotel, there was a line of at least 8 guest and there was only one person checking people in.", 
    "Enjoyable stay with a hotel located within walking distance of the main attractions", 
    "Short walk to Michigan Avenue shops, Navy Pier, City Tour Buses (bookable at Hotel with a discount). Recommend a Lake-view room for great views over the Chicago River & Navy Pier.", 
    "Room with a lake view is worth it!", 
    "This hotel has a fresh look and great employees. A contemporary, yet comfortable atmosphere that makes you want to stay longer! Room was great and had an amazing view of Navy pier and the lake. Whole room was very nice! Love the swissotel, will be back soon! P. S. I want those pillows on the bed! ", 
    "Very nice, modern hotel. Friendly staff, very nice rooms with wonderful view. It was close to shopping, museums, Navy Pier.", 
    "The hotel staff were extremely efficient and helpful, with excellent recommendations for places to eat (which they reserved for us) and for entertainment.", 
    "Excellent location with proximity to river front, boat cruise start point and lots of restaurants in the vicinity. Courteous hotel staff. Housekeeping and food service was good. A great place for tourists and business travellers.", 
    "room was nice and clean. The staff was friendly and courteous. ", 
    "Excellent as always", 
    "You want a nice hotel. Go here. Rooms were clean, staff was friendly and helpful and the bed was very comfortable. I've been to five star hotels and the swissotel has been my favorite pick.", 
    "Very good value for the price I paid in very busy season. Location is superb! Passed the expensive valet parking (still about average) and used a self-park garage which was very secure and was directly connected to the hotel. We chose this hotel so that our kids could watch the Navy Pier fireworks just outside hotel. Instead of walking to the NP, we took a 2 minute walk to the East end of upper Wacker drive. Fantastic spot to watch the fireworks. If you want to watch the fireworks from the room, the corner king room is the only possibility. From our room next to the corner king, 2/3 would have be behind other buildings. If you want to watch it from a room, I recommend W Lakeshore. We'd stay Swissotel again.", 
    "Room in tip-top condition...looks like it may have been recently remodeled. Get a room with a view and you'll see Navy Pier, the lake, Chicago river with the many tour barges and some snazzy new hi-rise apartments all around you. Fitness center was free (not $15 as mentioned by some other commenters) and room had a small drink fridge also free---guess they gave up on the mini-bar idea which is just as well, since CVS and other retailers are close by for drinks and snacks). All in all, a pleasant stay.", 
    "Every time we spoke to someone on the staff they were very helpful and nice. ", 
    "The pros: amazing views, great location, spacious rooms and well designed bathrooms. The cons: extremely uncomfortable beds and no coffee maker in room although it is listed as an amenity included in the room. There is an additional cost if you want one during your stay which is not listed in the reservation information.", 
    "didn't eat, drink or us the gym/pool. comfortable bed, spacious room........one day not cleaned very well!", 
    "Quattro giorni per visitare Chicago, avvantaggiati dalla posizione centrale dell'Hotel. Camera con stupenda vista del lago Michigan. Servizio ineccepibile. Prezzo equo. Assolutamente consigliabile.", 
    "Hotel excelentemente ubicado, cerca de todo. El hotel es caro para el servicio que brinda y el estado del hotel en general no es de lo mejor. El personal es atento, lo necesario. Las fotos que muestran en internet difieren bastante con lo que me encontre cuando llegue al hotel. La habitacion que me dieron se nota que tiene bastante uso, la alfombra tenia muchas manchas, el empapelado de las paredes manchado y en algunas partes se estaba despegando. Lo bueno de la habitacion las camas, muy comodas.", 
    "My daughter and I spent three restful nights and enjoyed three scrumptious breakfast buffets. The fitness center was solid too.", 
    "Great place to stay. Good location, nice views. Rooms were clean, comfortable and quiet. Would definitely stay there again.", 
    "We were very pleasantly surprised at the appearance of the hotel. Very comfortable and clean. The entire staff was exceptionally friendly and helpful. We couldn't have been treated better. The view was wonderful! I had no idea which location or hotel to stay at, now that I am a little more familiar with the city, I would definitely choose this one again! Thank you! ", 
    "Location is great for walking to all major sites, but not right on major transportation lines. Hotel service is great overall, but the bathroom supplies sometimes not refilled as expected.", 
    "It was too short! Good stay, good hotel.", 
    "Very clean hotel near Navy Pier with excellent views. Walking distance to lots of things. We would stay here again.", 
    "Everything is good but no free Wi-Fi. Wi-Fi is as important as water and electricity, yet you pay that on top of room charge. I will not consider this hotel next time just because of this.",

    "I was looking for a four star hotel on various travel web sites for my weekend visit to Chicago. Among the many options I found an \"unpublished\" rate for a undisclosed 4 star hotel in Chicago. The rate was much reduced and I thought I'd book it and see how it would go. It ended up being a great experience. Friendly front desk young woman checked me in and gave me a room on 30th floor with a nice view of the Chicago River. Very clean and well appointed room with a super bathroom. All pros and no cons for Swissotel Chicago. Highly recommend to others looking for a fab hotel at a great location!", 
    "Effortless check in and check out. Provided info about the city and always made sure transportation was available.",

    "Rooms smaller than I thought. Luxurious bathroom, nice location. Beds very comfortable. Would be nice if one could check in before 3pm without a large fee. Parking is very expensive, but no different than anywhere in Chicago. Close to everything. Lovely French lady helped us check in. May return, but will probably try another hotel with larger room.",

    "The hotel was very nice and modern but the service was poor. Sat in the bar for 10 mins before someone took our order. After another 15 mins a new server came by to check on us. They retook the order and it took another 10 mins. Tons of staff running around - very inefficient. Went to breakfast in the morning and service was awful. Clearly understaffed. People were complaining all around about the poor service. I felt bad for our server - he was clearly overwhelmed. We were supposed to be served fresh pasteries during our breakfast. We asked 4 times they never came until the bill. If you are going to offer something, you should be able to deliver. Great hotel but they need to get service in order before it tanks their business.",

    "The staff is outstanding, professional and friendly. They made our visit very pleasant and efficient. Excellent location proximately to restaurants and shopping. Safe to walk outside at night", 
    "My only less than stellar feedback was the floor under the bed was filthy. Obviously the person responsible to the room cleanliness was less than efficient. Also, no refill of my \"K-cups\" in my room which meant that I ad to go to the lobby for coffee and bring back to my room. That was unfortunate as those whit whom I interacted were wonderful.", 
    "We reserved a room on the 31st floor. The view was awesome. The hotel is located close to the John Hancock tower and is walking distance from the Magnificent Mile and public transportation. The staff was extremely helpful and anticipated our needs. Additionally the bar is excellent. Cocktails were made with care and the food was excellent. Definitely recommend.", 
    "The hotel has a great location, lovely staff and beautiful rooms. What more can you ask for?", 
    "Lovely property - very comfortable and nicely appointed room with a good view, desk, and very comfortable bed and linens. When I couldn't get room service (no answer after multiple calls) I went to the front desk and they were really accommodating and had it ordered and sent up promptly. Small fitness room would be the only drawback here.", 
    "Overall I was impressed with the friendly efficient service and the top notch quality of the room and restaurant/bar. Excellent location too. Good job Sofitel!", 
    "Friendliest hotel staff I've had. Attentive, concerned, and want to make your visit the best. ", 
    "Quiet, well run hotel with European flair. Room carefully planned and very comfy. Bathroom is devine with French amenities. Everything works properly. Only minor flaw was inconsistent housekeeping, some days perfect, others missed a soap or failed to replace shampoo. Overall a lovely hotel, very pleasant stay and would repeat visit without question.", 
    "I was recently in Chicago for a Seminar and needed to book a room for the first night of my travels as the other hotel where I was later staying could not accommodate a Wednesday night stay. I found the staff to be particularly helpful. I forgot my Ipad Mini Lightening Charge Cord in the room and when I stopped back on the following day, Volkan, who was at the front desk personally went to the room and retrieved if for me. The availability of coffee, fruit and free work out facilities made the hotel a value where the other hotel where I later stayed charged for everything. The hotel is hip and has updated amenities and is centrally located to great restaurants and shopping. I will definitely be returning to stay here in the future. ",

    "We had a great time at the Sofitel. The location was perfect for sightseeing, shopping and exploring the numerous restaurants in downtown Chicago. It's 2 blocks from a CTA station so it's very accessible. The staff were all very friendly, courteous and helpful! When our flight got cancelled and we had to recheck back into the hotel for an extra night, we got upgraded as a \"thank you\" for coming back. It made our day after all the trouble we had to deal with the cancelled flight! They also offer free wifi, which may be a small thing but a lot of high end hotels ask you to pay for this as an extra. I would come back and stay here again, because even with a little bit higher room rate, you're getting your money's worth in terms of comfort and service. ",

    "So enjoyed this sleek, clean, modern hotel within walking distance of Michigan Ave and other attractions. Hotel staff is excellent, attending to every need quickly. Would stay here again in a heartbeat. Free good coffee in the AM. Cozy fireplace near bar. Didn't use the restaurant but it was bright and seemed popular. The rooms weren't the biggest but had lovely spa-like bathrooms and comfortable beds. Amazing views from our 25th floor room. Elevators were efficient and quick. All in all one of the best stays we've had in Chicago, and we've stayed in many hotels there visiting family. Will definitely come again!",

Fancy Kureg coffeemaker didn't work and staff were slow to bring up another one. We had already got dressed to go down to lobby to bring up some coffee. No charging stations for phone. It's 2015... Everyone needs to charge their phones. I had to hunt for a wall plug behind bed. Bath robe in bathroom was hard and scratchy. ",

    "Spent 1 week on business. When staying for business, I want the hotel to be as smooth as possible. And the Sofitel succeeded in this on almost every level. The only disappointing thing is the wifi costs. To get usable wifi I had to pay $14.99 per day. I feel a hotel like the Sofitel should not be nickle and diming their customers. ",

    "Fantastic location right in the heart of it all. Walk to nearby shopping, restaurants, etc Staff was extremely polite and helpful. Would recommend.",

    "Todo excelente pero no me gusto mucho como hacen los cuartos, no los recogen ni ordenan bien", 
    "My stay was wonderful. From check in to breakfast, all was perfect. One thing though, my mattress was too soft for me. But it is very personal as I prefer firm mattresses. Other than that, very satisfied with my stay. Perfect location.",

    "I WAS VERY PLEASED WITH THE HOTEL!!!!! EVERYTHING WAS EXCELLENT", 
    "Very nice hotel.", 
    "When we first arrived on 2/6/15, they greeted us with open arms. Didn't have to touch our bags, they were brought to our room, and our car parked safely. From the moment we stepped inside this hotel, we felt like we were in heaven. All night food service brought to the room. We left a couple of things in our car. They gladly went to the car to go get our items. Room was perfect, just would have loved a refrigerator to store food after our outings. The location was prefect to walk to Michigan ave, and shop!!!! The people in the city were very nice. I can't wait to come back to Chicago, we will be staying here again!!!!", 
    "Very nice hotel in excellent location just a block away from Michigan Av. and walking distance from trendy boutiques on Wabash. Very good and kind customer service, attention to details. Rooms are nice, beds and pillows comfy and everything looks clean and tidy. Restaurant Cafe des Architects is a very nice option for dinner. The hotel in general is elegant and upscale and the front desk personnel and bell boys one of the kindest I've seen in Chicago. I no doubt recommend it and will go back when in my kind of town.",

In general, very good value for money and if I got a similar deal I would definitely stay there again.", 
    "Good hotel. We felt that the room size was small and found it bit expensive. ", 
    "Short stay in Chicago. Hotel was convenient, clean and staff very welcoming.", 
    "Stayed three nights at the Sofitel for a weekend getaway. The hotel was extremely well priced for the beautiful accommodations (probably because it was January), but I plan to visit Chicago more often and stay at this same hotel. It was well situated for all of our activities. Our room was spacious and top notch. Only went to the restaurant for breakfast, but it was wonderful.", 
    "Beautiful space and great service", 
    "I am not generally a fan of modern decor, however, this hotel is very tastefully done! The rooms are lovely and I really like this area of Chicago. ",

    "Fantastic weekend get away hotel. Best possible location for both walking around during the day and going out at night. Rooms are fantastic and hotel has great vibe.", 
    "The best hotel I have stayed in Chicago. Service to customers is outstanding and I was wowed by the front desk staff with their exquisite welcoming. Room was warm, confortable bed, gigantic bathroom, ammenities of all sort: a true example of French taste and attention to detail. Not to mention the excellent price for such a great room and location. A very pleasant experience for a 1 night stay that stands out among all my recent business trips! ", 
    "Restaurant was great! Bar was great! Room was good except for the bed was just too soft in the middle like it needed to be replaced otherwise everything was just excellent.", 
    "From the moment we pulled up to the hotel until we left the service was outstanding. We walked to dinner and to the theatre with ease --we can't wait to stay there again. It will definitely be our hotel of choice when we stay in Chicago!", 
    "Awesome hotel. Stayed for 2 nights and not a single complaint. The location is awesome with plenty of restaurants close by - try Luxbar just three blocks away and excellent. Hancock Observatory was directly outside our window which was an amazing view it is also well worth the visit to the Observatory Deck. The concierge service never disappointed although our visit was short we packed a lot in and loved staying at this hotel. The wait staff at the bar were fabulous and the little snacks they provide are amazing -especially the popcorn! Great view of the Hancock Building stay in room 1710.", 
    "Great experience for our short stay. We did not have time to experience all this place has to offer. However, everything we experienced was great. Room service was very good quality and staff was exceptionally friendly.",

    "Great location, very comfortable beds and a modern, hip vibe. We would stay again.", 
    "My wife, two (older) children and I took a quick trip to Chicago for the weekend. We booked this hotel mainly for it's convenient location and comparatively affordable rates. In fact, it was so affordable that while we initially booked a room with two doubles, my wife and I booked another room for ourselves when we got there. We were thoroughly impressed with the Sofitel quality. The architectural design and great personal service are unique experience for families that value such attributes. Pictures of Picasso and other artists line the walls and blend in with the rest demonstrating a commitment to aesthetic values beyond the provincial effort of other places. Our trip to the Art Institute over the weekend seemed to fit perfectly. The food was equally great although here I must admit, a bit pricey. There is a BOSE radio in every room (at least the two we were in) and that meant a lot to me. Along with the things mentioned above, this small attention to detail overwhelmingly makes Sofitel experience \"worth\" more than many other hotels in the area that boast luxury at its corresponding price. Highly subjective review, I know. But we were sufficiently and pleasantly surprised enough to share a positive experience. ", 
    "wonderful, we will come back! The hotel attended to personal preferences!", 
    "Went on a couples trip and had an amazing time. We got there and upgraded to a suite and it was perfect size for having our friends stop over and lounge around before dinner out. LeBar is always a great spot to end the night have enjoy a night cap. Amazing hotel with great service. We will be staying there again in the future.",

    "I spent time with my daughter who goes to school in the area. The location was convenient for walking or taking the train to where we wanted to go. My room was clean, stylish, and with a very comfortable bed. The service was great. The hotel's French contemporary restaurant was elegant, and the food was delicious.", 
    "We had a wonderful stay celebrating our 2nd Anniversary. We felt that we received exceptional hospitality by the hotel staff all around. We would recommend Sofitel Chicago to everybody!", 
    "Nice hotel. Very central. Excellent condition. The only reason I'm not giving full marks is that there was a kind of smell in my room.", 
    "Wonderful \"girls\" overnight! My best friend and I celebrated her birthday and enjoyed our stay at this fine hotel. We were immediately upgraded upon arrival to the 30th floor- awesome view! A delicious little chocolate dessert was sent to our room, compliments of the hotel, in honor of my friend's birthday. Our room was perfect, love the bathroom! The bar is great, too. Staff is very friendly.", 
    "We asked for an received an early check in since we ordered in room massages. The masseuses arrived on time and set up their tables as coordinated by the hotel. It was a very nice room, very comfortable. We at breakfast in the morning which was nice. The service in the restaurant was a little slow, but we weren't in a hurry, so they may have sensed that. Great Stay.", 
    "This was my second time in this hotel. I was disappointed by a couple of misunderstandings with the staff, first when I was checking in, and then when I was leaving for the airport. Also, while I remember being impressed by the presentation of food ordered from the room service menu in the past, during this visit, the presentation was poor. This is still a nice hotel, but it didn't meet the expectations that had been set a couple of years back.", 
    "Excellent choice for a last minute getaway. Hotel is conveniently located within walking distance or a short cab ride of most major attractions and an abundance of great dining! ", 
    "This was the nicest hotel I have ever stayed at. The staff was polite and helpful and the room was very clean and comfortable.", 
    "Great getaway for my late-December birthday! Nice location for restaurants, access to Magnificent Mile. Clean confortable room, with beautiful city view. Welcoming, warm staff made our stay most enjoyable. Only very small concern was size of the shower...rather claustrophobic.", 
    "I had a one night stay the rom was very comfortable. The concierge was very helpful. Great location.", 
    "We were looking to get away for a night. I decided to upgrade to a high floor king. I just had different expectations based on an upgraded king room and my experience and other high-end hotels. Everything was fine the bathroom was the best attribute of what was otherwise a fairly plain room.", 
    "Great rooms. Nice comfortable pillows. Slept half of the day. Great view of the city. The hotel lady by the name of Hyo was a greattttt help. Will be back soon;)", 
    "Excellent hotel. Rooms seem soundproof. Peaceful sleep and great service. Location is well put", 
    "very good hotel experience", 
    "We loved the Sofitel Hotel. The location is perfect. The staff is excellent. We will certainly stay there again. ", 
    "This hotel was modern, clean, and close to the Magnificent Mile and lots of other shops and restaurants, which was absolutely perfect for our trip. My husband and I had a great experience here for a short 3-day getaway. They upgraded us to a higher floor upon check-in (without charge) and all the staff were very friendly. We had a good time at Le Bar on evening, which has a great food and cocktail menu. Our room was modern, the king bed was super comfy, and we absolutely loved the amenities in the bathroom, which included Lanvin toiletries and a separate tub and shower. The hotel is also close to the Red Line (stop at State and Chicago), which was also really nice for getting around to some other neighborhood shopping and eating (i.e., Lincoln Park, Lakeview, etc.). Overall, location, services, amenities, and comfort were amazing and we would definitely come back!", 
    "We had a wonderful time. The hotel was very beautiful! The staff was very kind and helpful. It was located near many tourist attractions that were in walking distance. We would definitely stay there again.", 
    "Overall hotel was modern and neighborhood great. My only complaint is that the food/drinks within the hotel were very overpriced. I understand that it is a luxury hotel, but I wasn't impressed by the quality of the food foe the price. The bar has a hip atmosphere. Skip room service or breakfast at the hotel and go to the cafe next door. You will get more food for the $$.", 
    "WE had a wonderful stay at this hotel. When we arrived we were given a room and when we got to the room the room was not serviced. WE talked to the registration staff immediately and they gave us a clean room. Later that day the management apologized for their mistake by sending us chocolate covered strawberries and water. It was a very nice and classy gesture.", 
    "Love hotel. Great lobby great location to all shops & restaurants. Michigan ave is walking distance away. ", 
    "Let me start by saying the Sofitel is one of the most beautiful hotels in the city. The exterior deserves to be on the Chicago skyline and the lobby is one of the nicest in the city. Service was quick, clean, percise and courteous. I love the french accents by the way. The only knock is I felt kind of let down by the appearance of my guestroom. Now it was very nice and clean but I almost felt like I walked into different hotel, again it was very nice, but I expected to be impressed as I was with the rest of the hotel.", 
    "Love this hotel! Staff was very friendly and had recommendations to make my stay even better. Located in the same block as a grocery, pharmacy and restaurants. Would definitely stay here again.",

    "Great hotel in great location w/ great service (especially Meghan at front desk). In town for Christmas to see brother and sister in law and it was an outstanding experience. Highly recommend!", 
    "I enjoyed this hotel very much. The rooms are reasonable for the quality and comfort. They are new and have plenty of amenities. One of the best features is that the hotel doesn't gouge for basic services like internet and television. Basic internet is free for the guests and there are options to pay for higher speeds. The gym has 12 cardio machines along with dumbbells and a machine which is nice for travelers. Each cardio machine has a television and is top quality. ", 
    "We love the Sofitel! One of the best hotels in Chicago. Everything about it is excellent. Great location, great service, great food and the decor is very sleek modern and clean. Highly recommend it.", 
    "very enjoyable fantastic breakfast parking was very easy", 
    "The staffs are really nice. The shampoos are from Lavin. The fitness center is a little bit small but they have free water, bananas and apples. ", 
    "Hotel was very clean and comfortable. We were able to get a late check-out, which was great.", 
    "Enjoyed my stay. Thanks for the great hospitality.", 
    "A great hotel.", 
    "Didn't get to experience much of the hotel since we were out most of the time. I was disappointed that there's no mini fridge in the room for leftovers. Stayed in a king superior room and no mini fridge, what's up with that!? I think the only extra for getting the king superior was the nicer bathroom, which was quite nice. Would definitely stay there agin. Staff were quite nice.", 
    "Good location, easy access to dining, shopping, entertainment. ", 
    "Appreciate the fact they accommodated an early check in because of my arrival time at the airport.", 
    "An amazing stay for so many reasons...",

    "one of the best in Chicago", 
    "My wife and I were celebrating our 25th wedding anniversary in Chicago and had not stayed at a Sofitel hotel. We were thoroughly impressed by the hotel staff and food during our stay. In my years traveling for business and pleasure no hotel compared to the personal touch, professionalism and sincere interest in ensuring that our stay was a distinctly positive, enjoyable and memorable experience. The Sofitel more than accomplished this. We will be making a point to stay at a Sofitel over other premier hotels whenever possible during our future travels.", 
    "The staff is great! Nice location! I think I will stay here for the next time. Near everywhere.", 
    "This hotel was perfect! Great location, beautiful rooms, and very friendly staff. We will definitely stay here again.",

    "Stayed in Chicago a number of times and this is a great hotel choice; The staff is sophisticated and pleasant and hotel room was very nice with a very large bathroom; Located a block and a half from Watertower Mall , it is close to many bars/restaurants in the Gold Coast area; also near Nordstrom Rack. ", 
    "Fantastic stay! Great property, staff, location and the bed was great. No surprises, the hotel exceeded our expectations and we will definitely return.", 
    "From the onset, this hotel provides one great experience after another. All staff go out of the way to make sure you feel at home. ", 
    "- very friendly and professional staff - great experience at all", 
    "Wonderful treat to stay in such a welcoming hotel. Brought my two girls and my mom to Chicago for two wonderful Broadway shows and to shop at the America Girl store. The hotel was wonderfully decorated for the holidays and the girls loved the cookies at bed time. ", 
    "Very nice hotel, great location. I would definitely stayed there again.", 
    "Great Staff, Great Hotel...We will come back!", 
    "Last Thanksgiving we ate at Cafe des Architects. This year we ended up returning at Thanksgiving so decided to eat there again and then extend our stay to the hotel. We are very glad we did. We had a long drive in to Chicago so arrived late afternoon on Thanksgiving. The valet man gave us a great tip to self park since we were not taking our car in and out. That saved us about $20. The front desk and bell hop people were very friendly. We booked for a cheaper, lower room and were upgraded to a lovely upper room. The room was spacious and well appointed. There is a luxurious 4 piece bath with great extras like loofahs and creams. There was a Keurig coffee maker and we had free wireless that was pretty good. The bed was large and extremely comfortable. It was quiet and beyond comfortable. When we booked I paid $10 more for continental breakfast. Well, Cafes des Architectes does not really have a continental breakfast.....they have a full, fabulous breakfast. Offerings are from bacon and eggs to omelettes to oatmeal. Juice and coffe/tea are included. I would say it was worth $30-40 so the upgrade was well worth it. This hotel is on Rush Street so it close to the Magnificent Mile. Both the restaurant and bar are worth a stop. The breakfast was unexpected, the Thanksgiving dinner was great, the wait staff is professional and friendly. The bar prepares a great Manhattan. Come enjoy this hotel.", 
    "the stay was great. the hotel was very clean. staff was excellent.", 
    "Spent 4 nights at the Sofitel, excellent location for the downtown area, great facilities and helpful staff. Would highly recommend ", 
    "Sofitel is great! I've been there for 3 times and also I will recommend the hotel to my friends. ", 
    "Just spent a lovely Thanksgiving weekend in Chicago and we had a wonderful time at the Sofitel. Many fabulous restaurants, more than enough shopping, and handy to the Second City Comedy venue.", 
    "Concierge was not very friendly or helpful . (Middle aged man with blonde hair)", 
    "Concierge service was awesome - best I have experienced.", 
    "Love this hotel. Beautiful, contemporary with style and great food.", 
    "From the moment the valet held the door for us upon check-in to the moment they wished us \"Good day\" on our way out, this hotel delivered top service. We were extremely pleased with all aspects of the hotel. ", 
    "We were in town for four days to see shows and do shopping, so we wanted to be close to Loop and near North. During our stay, the lobby had on display a collection of very interesting photos of 2oth century artists working in France.", 
    "The entire staff, including the doormen, front desk, bartenders, and housekeeping, were all quite helpful and courteous. Also, the holiday decorations were gorgeous. We will definitely use the Sofitel again.", 
    "Great hotel, great, helpful staff, comfortable room", 
    "My daughter had her first wedding dress appointment nearby and this was so easy to walk every where we needed to walk and pamper us for a special weekend.", 
    "Sofitel is a striking building and that inspiring look carries on inside as well. Beautiful design creates an elegant atmosphere. Our room was perfectly sized with a king bed, desk and comfy chair. Functional design hid the minibar and room safe and allowed plenty of storage. Kurig coffe maker was a nice touch along with the customary iron and hair drier. The bathroom had separate tub and shower and plenty of soft hot water, and a loofa! Some people may consider the room small, no separate sitting area, but we didn't go to the city and pay for an upscale hotel to sit in the room. It is comfortable and well appointed. Great design gives good energy. The staff were all friendly, helpful and knowledgeable of the hotel and the local area. We did not eat at the restaurant but did enjoy the bar. An intimate urban space with soft LED lighting. ", 
    "Was an unforgettable experience in this Sofitel, very professional and friendly Staff with two wonderful features inside, the French restaurant and the modern bar.", 
    "For the high price I got a deal.", 
    "Wonderful stay!", 
    "Would definitely go back or recommend to a friend..", 
    "This hotel is very well located, being in walkable distance to almost anything, rooms have a red carpet that looks run down and old fashioned. Barhrooms have a wallpaper that looks from a nineties movie. The staff is incredibly friendly and helping.i would stay here again if its the cheapest in its categorie. Crowd in the hotel is nice, the bar is always ful ", 
    "Always a relaxing pleasure at the Sofitel. Great hotel in great location. Breakfast is excellent. ", 
    "Great location, and staff, the hotel overall it's great, will stay here again !",

    "Had a horrible time at the airport..staff made me feel like I was at home with my family..excellent service.", 
    "Staff always up to help people, our room always ready, very nice bar, one of the best on Chicago, recommended 100%", 
    "It was good, I won't stay there again because the hotel charged me $125 for incidentals. It will be reimbursed, but annoying now I have to follow up and make sure it's refunded. I have have experienced that in my travels.", 
    "Very nice hotel, great customer service and excellent location to Michigan Ave. We had the breakfast and it was fabulous", 
    "My daughter and I just stayed one night at the hotel but will return next time we need a hotel off of Michigan Ave. Great location. We had dinner and breakfast at the hotel restaurant - Cafe des architectes - French Restaurant. The meal was outstanding, the service was outstanding and we would eat there again. When we arrived to our room there was a dessert and two bottles of water waiting for us with a card wishing me a happy birthday. In the evening there is a turn down service and we found chocolate chip cookies in the room by the bed. These small touches really made the stay memorable. In the morning in the cafe there is free coffee and tea but I recommend having breakfast there. My daughter had the nutella pancakes and I had crepes. They walk around with fresh breads and crossiants that are made daily. We take a trip once a year to Chicago and we will book this hotel again.", 
    "Always a comfortable and pleasant stay. Hotel conditions still look good. Rooms are nice size and very quiet when compared to a stay at another nearby hotel.", 
    "Everything as expected for the price. Great service, great room, great location.", 
    "This is a very nicely appointed, quiet and comfortable hotel. The staff is eager to please and very professional. This is the second time ( in 5 years) that we have stayed here and it has been the same story both times. If you valet the car, they give you a number to text when you want your car brought up and they text you when it is ready. That is smart. The room is very comfortable, we had a Junior Suite on our first visit and got a Luxury Room this visit and I didn't miss the extra space of the Suite. The bed is superb.", 
    "Have stayed here many times. Excellent hotel in every way in a great location.", 
    "One of our top hotel choices in Chicago.. The lobby area, restaurant, rooms and staff are excellent.. Great location - walking distance to all shops and restaurants.. Love Sofitel :)", 
    "The hotel is great - modern and clean, and focused on customer service. The location is wonderful. Near Michigan Avenue, but not on it so it's away from the madness. Also just a few blocks from the subway, super convenient. We would definitely stay here again.", 
    "Great hotel in a fun area", 
    "Great hotel with an amazing location. The only reason we didn't give it the highest rating was because the telecom closet was right next door and there was a constant tapping/ratcheting noise in the bathroom that we could hear throughout our stay.", 
    "My friend and I enjoyed our stay at the Sofitel near the Water Tower. The location is great for walking to various sites. The staff were all friendly and helpful. The room was clean and well-appointed.", 
    "Beautiful hotel, friendly staff! Room was clean and comfortable. Bathroom immaculate. Love the fragrance in the lobby!", 
    "Perfect location for business and pleasure. Easy access to everything a visitor may need in Chicago.Staff are very nice and could not be more helpful", 
    "After a less than stellar appearance I decided to stay here again with my family. Check in was fine till they could't figure out where they stored my luggage and I walked with the bellman through all the storage areas to find it. Room was great. The guys at the front door were obnoxious and always seemed very involved with themselves. I wanted to use the Equinox around the corner (the fitness center is quite small at the hotel but certainly usable) and having worked there years ago I knew the policy for age was 16 and over. The concierge was pretty sure it wasn't. I made him call the place to confirm I was correct. Rather than just say sorry and enjoy your workout he blamed the place for false info. Dining service was chaotic and the food trickled to my table. First some pancakes for my daughter which she loved. 2 minutes later some eggs for me. 4 minutes later my toast arrived. There was just 2 of us. Sure this is all sort of minor stuff. If this were a discount motel I'd be pretty impressed but at between 400-500 per night these little details become glaring. I really wanted this to work but I think my colleagues and I are done with you for now.", 
    "Meridith, the bar tender was our first encounter with service excellence and it never dropped from there. Everything was an A+ (except the decor seems a bit dated and the finishes are a little worn). But I would stay there again. The rooms are large and VERY comfortable. They even have a bathtub, which is wonderful. Although a little short. ", 
    "I stayed at this hotel when I was running the marathon. The hotel is in a great location; easy to get to North Michigan ave and from there to all major neighbourhoods. The staff were always extremely friendly, personable and attentive without being overbearing. The room was big, clean and well furnished with great facilities. The views were great too! A big plus was the restaurant.... The food for both breakfast and dinner was always excellent and although a touch on the high side, I felt overall was pretty reasonably priced. I will absolutely recommend this hotel and would like to express thanks to al staff who made my stay so relaxed, comfortable and pleasant. ", 
    "We had a great experience staying at Sofitel Water Tower North. It was expensive due to the Chicago marathon that weekend but we ended up very happy we stayed here due to its convenience to all downtown had to offer. The amenities were very nice. It was clean and comfortable. The staff was superb.", 
    "All excellent except the ladies at the restaurant desk had us wait for a table when there were plenty available with the explanation they were not cleared as get. The organization of the dining room at the top is less than perfect. The waitress was very nice.", 
    "The staff was great and the hotel was a treat. The neighborhood setting and easy access to shopping and restaurants made for a fun and unique experience. We will definitely stay here again.", 
    "Service, Lage, Einrichtung und speziell das hilfsbereite und freundliche Personal - einfach alles sehr,sehr gut.", 
    "Great Hotel. The room was great but was very dry. Never drank so much water in my live. The concierge gave us some misinformation on the road closures. Thought that was their job. Over all loved the hotel.", 
    "The hotel is absolutely amazing. It is very modern, and the staff is incredibly professional and accommodating. I cannot recall being waited on that well since vacations to all-inclusives in Mexico. It is one of the best hotels I have ever stayed in. My only complaint was that it was difficult to get cold, yes cold, water in the morning at the sink. For some odd reason the water was often unbearably hot at the sink. Other than that I would definitely stay at the Sofitel again. It's pricey, but well worth it given the amenities and quality of service.", 
    "Staff went out of their way to make sure our stay was a pleasant experience. My future daughter in law had a suite the night before her wedding, I also stayed due to convenience with my 5 year old grand-daughter who was the flower girl. The morning of the wedding we headed towards the lobby for breakfast, asked if they had any crayons to keep my 5 year old entertained, but they did not. They went out of their way to sent some-one to the store to get crayons and immediately brought them to our suite. Thank you so much", 
    "Service was poor. Room was clean but mattress extremely soft and in need of replacement. Had to call for repairs to cable TV. Unimpressed compared to other Chicago hotels I've stayed. ", 
    "Pleasant experience even though the staff appeared short. The reception guy mark wanted me to stay there longer because of his kindness. ", 
    "Best lux hotel in Chicago. Period.", 
    "Courteous staff clean and modern with excellent locstion", 
    "Love the Chicago Sofitel! While the hotel is large, the friendly and accommodating staff always do a fantastic job of making me feel like I'm an important guest and not just a room number. I like to take my business to companies that place an emphasis on Customer service, and for me, Sofitel is on that list. The hotel itself is very desirably located just a few blocks away from Michigan Ave, Lake Shore Drive, Hancock Tower, the river, etc - all places that an out-of-towner might like to visit. The rooms are lovely with floor to ceiling windows and very large bathrooms. I'm sensitive to my surroundings, and I love that the rooms are decorated such that they feel modern, yet comfortable and inviting. I also love the view. Since Sofitel is situated amongst other buildings, you won't have an unobstructed view of the lake, but rooms on higher floors facing east will see parts of the lake in between some of the fabulous Chicago architecture :-) Overall, 2 enthusiastic thumbs up! Can't wait to go back.", 
    "We spent four nights here early October and enjoyed our stay. The bedroom was spacious and very comfortable. The hotel bar was good. Breakfast was OK. Staff very pleasant and helpful. Had a great stay in Chicago and would definitely stay here again.", 
    "We have visited Chicago many times, and this is by far our favorite place to stay. The location couldn't really be any better if you are looking for shopping, dining, and entertainment along the Gold Coast, or the north end of the Magnificent Mile. Being just a block and a half off Michigan meant we were close to everything, yet the heavy traffic was not on our doorstep. Loved the little park across the street. The complimentary breakfast was actually a breakfast! Well done all around. We have found our new go-to place for staying in Chicago.", 
    "Grat business stay.", 
    "Sofitel water tower Chicago was fantastic, the service was very professional and made you feel very important. The room was clean and the bed very comfortable. Would highly recommend this hotel to a friend.", 
    "Very well designed and comfortable hotel at a good location next to the Lamborghini dealer :-)", 
    "Wish I would have found this hotel sooner! I have been traveling to Chicago for business every month for the past two years. I always make it a point to try a different hotel each time in order to get the full flavor if such a great city. Had I found the Sofitel sooner, it would have been my go-to. This is a terrific property, very comfortable, clean, good restaurants, and located in the perfect neighborhood. Easy walking distance to Gibsons and Del Frisco's, and a ton of great shopping. You won't be disappointed here!", 
    "Excellent hotel in a very convenient location, great staff and fantastic bed.", 
    "Sofitel's beds are absolutely the most comfortable I've ever slept on. While I'm not a fan of the Hermes bath products provided in each bathroom, I did hear from the Manager who kindly offered soaps/shampoos/lotions in a different scent upon request. I will continue to be a patron of this hotel.", 
    "The hotel was very nice. the room was clean but not as impressive as we were led to believe. The desk was all scratched up and the carpet a bit worn.", 
    "Great hotel stay and concierge advice. Close to many attractions. We would come back.", 
    "Our wedding weekend was a total success with the help of Sofitel Chicago. We had three rooms, a King Suite, a JR Suite and one King Bed. The two suites were used for bride and groom prepping. They were great rooms to entertain friends and family prior to the ceremony. The Sofitel Chicago is a wonderful place in a perfect location. We have stayed here several times and enjoy it more and more every time. ", 
    "Never stayed at a Sofitel hotel before and had a wonderful experience. The rooms were very clean and a good size. The beds had extra padding for comfort, which was very nice. The Bathroom was nice and big. The staff was very nice and friendly. Enjoyed my stay. Thank you. ", 
    "The whole experience was wonderful. Staff were very friendly, helpful and accommodating in so many ways.", 
    "Our room was small but very nicely decorated. Minimalist and clean. Bathroom was lovely, shower was dreamy. Really nice Lanvin products in bathroom. The service was not Four Seasons quality, but it was very very good regardless. Had drinks and snacks in the bar and they were great.", 
    "This hotel is modern, spacious, luxurious and situated very close to both the key shopping areas and dining areas of the northern part of the city. We were on the 17th floor and so didn't have much of a view but the upper floors would be able to see over the lake. Separate shower and bath was a real bonus and the king size bed was both large and comfortable. Had all the usual amenities for a good quality hotel and the work of the cleaning staff couldn't be faulted. Peter the concierge was extremely helpful with a couple of our requests and the check out/in was seamless. The walk to Michigan ave was only a couple of minutes as was the walk to the restaurant strip. Being in the more ritzy area of Chicago the cost of meals in the various restaurants was towards the upper end but we couldn't fault the food or service at any restaurant we visited. Overall the Sofitel was excellent and our stay was most enjoyable.", 
    "Enjoyed the hotel. It was conveniently located and very comfortable. Would highly recommend.", 
    "Due to some mistakes on our part we had some problems at check in. Michael (at the front desk) went out of his way to make things right. It was greatly appreciated.", 
    "Michael at guest relations was awesome Great location Great staff Makes a great hotel", 
    "Food was way too overpriced. I was also surprised on the size of the rooms,a bit small. Overall a good experience.", 
    "la atencion del personal fue muy buena,los precios del restaurante caros", 
    "Very enjoyable. Excellent service by all staff. Good gym.", 
    "Excellent service but very average room and value for the price. I am a Chicago native and I have stayed in other, comparable hotels with nicer rooms for less money. Location is good but other hotels are in the vicinity. In addition, I have stayed at other Sofitel locations that had much nicer rooms.", 
    "The hotel staff are cold and lack the sense of customer service. This is a reflection of the hotel attitude toward his guests. I am an expedia gold member legible for upgrade. Despite my 6 nights stay the hotel management showed zero interest to accommodate my request. The phrase they used ( subject to availability ). There are many other much nicer and courteous hotels in chicago magnificent mile area and I I do suggest to look for other hotels before some one consider this hotel", 
    "Staying af Sofitel Water Tower was a pleasure. Room was fine, staff was friendly and the location is fine for a quick tour down town Chicago after working hours.", 
    "My husband and I stayed one night in the Sofitel. The hotel is easy to find and in a great neighborhood. There is say access to the Red Line and constant cabs so you can go anywhere. It is a big, modern hotel and very European. If you want to save $20 plus valet tip, consider parking at the garage next door. It's very easy and about a minute walk. The rooms are bright and comfortable. We had a gorgeous view of the Hancock from our 23rd floor room. Love the beautiful marble bathroom with the Lanvin products. It was a nice stay and I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone--although it's not cheap!"

    "Nice hotel. Rooms well appointed. Staff was very pleasant. We were able to check in very early (around noon), which was a pleasant surprise. No pool or hot tub, which is fine with me, but would probably be a disappoitment to kids...thus the tile. Didn't eat in the restaurant, so can't comment there. I would definitely stay here again.", 
    "The hotel is a historical figure in Chicago that has gone through over a million dollar renovation. However, the standard room is a little on the tight side and would have enjoyed a tub in the bathroom. The room we stayed in had a snag in the carpet that had sharp pieces of staples coming out. We expressed the issue after stepping on it and we were compensated with a complimentary breakfast in their restaurant. The day we stayed was filled with events so the hotel and everywhere else around was hummming with people. So if you are planning on visiting this lovely city, I encourage you to book your reservation way in advanced. The plus side to this is where the hotel is located, it is in the heart of it all in my opinion, there are bikes for rent in almost every corner to enjoy the city without having to break your wallet. ", 
    "Over-all good experience. Front desk acted skeptical when I questioned a charge from the in-room bar. ", 
    "My husband and I were in Chicago to visit our daughter for Mother's Day. The Millennium Knickerbocker was so close to the bus stop we needed to catch, making it very easy to navigate our way around the city with out having to pay cab fare constantly.", 
    "Friendly and welcoming atmosphere. Great historic location in the best part of the city.", 
    "Staff, service, and overall hotel experience was perfect!", 
    "Excellent staff, nice rooms, great location! we were there for 6 nights and would go back if ever in Chicago again!", 
    "We were treated as royalty. We were given free martinis and appetizer at the gorgeous hotel bar while we waited for our room to be prepared. Furthermore, the staff was outstanding at every hour of our stay ", 
    "My husband and I can happily check Chicago off our bucket list with smiles. From the start, our surprise upgrade to a suite set the tone. The hotel was clean, room was very comfy, from the bedding to the room size. A martini bar is located in the lobby manned by the cordial Humberto and the concierge desk is manned by the best concierge we've ever encountered. Sheryl helped us plan our 3 days so that we made the most of our trip. She was a gem and was invaluable to the success of our trip. The hotel is located around the block from the John Hancock Building (great brunch on the 95th floor) and within walking distance to Lake Shore Drive and the beach. Don't miss the Architectural Cruise on the Chicago River or the free Lincoln Park Zoo amongst all the other attractions. Loved it!", 
    "The was very friendly and helpful ,they were very attentive and more importantly they were knowledgeable ", 
    "We had a great experience here, the accommodations were fantastic, they let us check in early at no charge which was great. The staff was very pleasant too! The only downside is that they charge for Wi-Fi which is crazy in this day and age. ", 
    "Very comfortable bed in a well-located historic hotel. We had a room right beside the elevators and were concerned about noise. As it turned out, noise was not a problem. The bed was exceptionally comfortable in the standard room. As an older hotel, there were some things that were a bit worn. However , overall it was a very good stay. I would have granted more stars in the facilities category if there were better in-hotel restaurant options. The hotel has a martini bar (with a limited food menu) and a breakfast restaurant. There was no room service option other than delivery from external restaurants (that were advertised in the room)", 
    "Excellent staff, beautiful historic hotel. Due to historic nature, rooms are small but renovated and well appointed. Bathrooms are well done but dimly lit. A lighted makeup mirror would be helpful. Great location for walking, catching a cab and 6 blocks from a red line station", 
    "Staff are friendly and helpful, hotel condition is ok as far as an old facility goes, the fan in one of my bathrooms wasn't working, for one night stay, I didn't bother to call the front desk. Other than that, it was good experience.", 
    "I have been staying here for 30 years. Incredible staff and best location in Chicago. Rooms are spotless, concierge is the best in the industry. The doormen spectacular. Best best bar staff in the world. And location is where you want to be.", 
    "The room was uncomfortably warm and we tried to adjust the thermostat to cool. Even at 65 the cool air would not come on. When we asked the desk we were told it would only work depending on the temperature outside. What that had to do with anything we could not understand and were told to open a window or that they would send up a fan. ", 
    "The old Knickerbocker has a lovely lobby and a marvelous Crystal ballroom. The bar area is very comfortable and calm, with fine service and good food. It's a cosy hotel at a good price. The location at the top of the Magnificent Mile (North Michigan Ave.) is convenient for shopping and restaurants, and it's an easy 20 minute walk to the river (if that) with lots of buses and cabs, if you're in a hurry.", 
    "The hotle room was beautiful, clean, and well kept. The bathroom facilities were wonderful although I am not a big fan of the rainfall showerheads. The hotel does not have in-room dining services but the bar and restaurant are great. Overall, this was a great place to stay.", 
    "I loved this hotel, but did not like that they would not change my original accommodations after one of my party was unable to join us. ", 
    "We stayed at the Knickerbocker for our first anniversary, and our first time staying downtown. It was just off of the Mag Mile, and the location was great! Quiet enough, and the old buildings are so beautiful. Highly recommend this hotel, and am looking forward to the next time I can stay there. Room was smaller than expected, but very nice nonetheless.", 
    "Hotel was a nice experience, good location for getting around to various attractions by walking, bus and subway. Only draw back is no breakfast and you had to pay for anything extra such as Wi-Fi. Staff was helpful but not overly friendly. Room was a bit small but the bed was fantastic.", 
    "Nice location. But, very mediocre hotel. The lobby is so generic, not welcoming, concierge rarely there, checkin desk tucked away and hard to find. I don't think anyone should pay for wifi when staying in an expensive hotel. Would not stay here again. ", 
    "Great experience and location. Great Walking distrance to restaurants, train stations, Michigan avenue, etc.", 
    "Great! Very clean. Very organized. Cozy lobby with piano music. Central to everywhere in downtown Chicago. ", 
    "The hotel staff, most notably the management, do not seem to care one bit about you or your concerns. The exceptions were the restaurant staff (wonderful food and professional service) and the bartender, who was very helpful. The room had no air conditioning. We were told it was because \"it's not hot season yet, so the A/C isn't turned on yet...this is a very old building.\" This was our honeymoon, and we hoped to receive the \"4-Diamond\" service for which dearly paid. This was a huge problem. We both agreed that the staff and amenities at the airport hotel we used the night before flying to Chicago were nicer than the Knickerbocker. Also, the remote hardly worked, and the channel selection was very limited. This wasn't so much a problem for us, as we were on our honeymoon and didn't watch much TV. Just FYI, though; some people like TV, and theirs was sub-par. The place smelled funny. There was no ice machine on our floor. The water pressure was terrible. The toilet would hardly flush. The bed was too soft (probably worn out). The bathroom was barely well-lit enough to shave. They wouldn't allow for a late checkout, even though we offered to pay for it. NOBODY GAVE A HOOT that it was our honeymoon. They covered all the bases with the \"sir, we apologize,\" etc., but it was clear that nearly nobody really cared if we were there or not. We paid good money. We had an awesome trip regardless. However, the hotel did not in any way contribute positively to our experience. ", 
    "Everything was pleasing. Nice bar. Lovely breakfasts. Great service. Everything was very nice.", 
    "Room was updated, comfortable beds, decent size, great location to michigan ave., & rush st.", 
    "Staff was friendly and helpful. The rooms were clean and towels were soft and clean! Good size room and 42 in.flat screen TV. No cigarette odor! Great accommodations. ", 
    "The staff was very friendly and helpful. Our room was very clean and comfortable. We especially loved the shower and the computer with dining and entertainment recommendations. The location was in perfect walking location to everything. We had a great stay at this hotel and will probably return! ", 
    "We always enjoy our stay and breakfast at the restaurant downstairs. The staff is always fantastic and friendly.", 
    "Don't think twice about choosing this hotel. Service was excellent and very helpful. Our room was the best!!! ", 
    "Heating was awful. No room service. Probably wouldn't have stayed there without Expedia special for it", 
    "Extremely gracious accommodating and hardworking staff. Very clean and an excellent design balance of old school Art Deco and streamlined modern amenities. We truly enjoyed our stay. Fabulous location. ", 
    "Enjoyed all the Chicago sights and in being such a central location was so easy to use the hop on hop off bus However was not impressed with the deposit taken by credit card in case services are used", 
    "Great Location - Quiet - Comfortable Bed - Friendly Staff - Excellent Value", 
    "Wonderful staff, housekeeping staff was wonderful as well as the valet service!", 
    "Sheryl was a wonderful staff member who assisted with reservations and recommendations. hotel was perfect!", 
    "I got a King size bed so the space around the bed was a little tight. There was also no tub. ", 
    "Centraal gelegen (Gold Coast) nabij de Navy Pier en de Magnificent Mile. Lekker rustig, goede kamer en vriendelijk personeel. Nadeel was de hoge prijs voor dagelijks internet op de kamer (niet meer van deze tijd). In de Lobby was wifi gratis. ", 
    "Nice, modern decor in hotel room with pleasant staff. ", 
    "My husband and I stayed at the Millenium Knickerbocker as a stay-cation during my spring break. The doormen greeted us in a very friendly manner and check in was smooth and quick. They even checked us in early. The room was small but clean and the bed was comfortable. It would have been nice to have a chair to sit in for reading or watching tv other than the desk chair. The curtains hid the terrible view, but I guess we didn't go there to stay in the room. Which brings me to the best part of our stay - the hotel's location. It is close to the lakefront, the beach, great restaurant, tons of shopping and public transportation. We discovered a great restaurant just a block away on Walton called Doc B's Fresh Kitchen and revisited a fabulous Belgian bakery on Walton for their extra special chocolate almond croissants. Yum! If you are looking for a breakfast or lunch with a view, go to Oak Tree, it's on the 7th floor of the 900 N Michigan shops. We would definitely stay there again. ", 
    "Great hotel to serve as a base for enjoying Chicago's Miracle Mile! Got an early check in and had two really nice rooms with the most comfortable hotel beds experienced in years. The lobby bar had a Friday night piano player, followed later by a jazz trio, and large screen TVs for sporting events. Although we caused a minor accident with broken glass in the lobby, Junior Therriauix, the manager on duty, eased the tension with humor and took care of us and the mess, allowing us to remember why staying at a great hotel enables great memories. The 80+ year old conciegre is wealth of knowledge who provided information obout restaurants and travel that allowed us to take advantage of things we otherwise would have missed. Definitely worth a return visit! ", 
    "Nice hotel... Clean, comfortable, and great location!", 
    "Everything great except for the fact that room wifi is not included and costs $11/day.", 
    "When I booked, complimentary wi-fi was supposed to be included. When I arrived, it was not. Edward at the Front Desk fixed that for me without a question. He was fantastic! The room was nice, but you could hear everything in the hall and a good portion of the neighbors. The bed was one of the best ever. Housekeeping didn't come until after 5pm on the first day, and then the second day was there at 7am - 14 hours later, which was odd. Everyone was very nice and helpful, it's a very clean hotel and room, and the location cannot be better.", 
    "got there and their system was down couldnt check in until half hour after I got there. Lobby was very nice with piano player. Get up to the room Wifi did not work for 2 days. Sheets smelled like cheap detergent. Ordered a wake up call and nobody even called me. For a 4 star hotel with good reviews it was a joke.", 
    "Stayed for 6 nights, the room was comfortable but a bit on the small side from rooms we normally stay in. Staff were very helpful, had a nice breakfast in the hotel on one of our days there. The only complaint I would have was the extra 11 dollars a day for wifi which you need to factor in to your budget if that is an essential", 
    "Everything was great! The beds were not as comfortable as I would have liked. The staff are very helpful and friendly! ", 
    "I enjoyed my stay at the Millennium Knickerbocker. The location is pretty good because it's not too far from shopping, the John Hancock building, and some really great restaurants. I also thought the bed was comfy, the room and bathroom were nicely decorated and clean, and the rooms were surprisingly quiet for being so close to Michigan Avenue. My only issues with this hotel are that it's a bit far from the 'L' (maybe a ten minute walk) and the room I was in was kind of small. For one person the room size is fine, but for two I think it would be too cramped. I would still suggest this hotel to friends though and would recommend they upgrade to a larger room if more than one person was going to be in a room. All in all, I would definitely recommend this hotel to someone who wants to be close to some of Chicago's best shopping.", 
    "This was a charming hotel to stay at with a great location close to the magnificent mile and many other attractions. The staff was friendly, the room was nice. The only complaint I had was the shower didn't have warm water. I only stayed one night so never called to have it fixed. ", 
    "The shower in our room leaked, causing all of our luggage and some of the contents to get wet. Upon checking out of our room, I mentioned this to the front desk staff. The employee not only not offered an apology, but seemed inconvenienced by the whole thing. ", 
    "One of the most uncomfortable beds I have ever had the misfortune to sleep in. I stayed another hotel the previous night, rated much lower with ten times the bed this establishment had to offer.", 
    "Hotel was well maintained and has a nice character. Bed was a bit uncomfortable, but everything else was what I was expecting. ", 
    "Beautiful hotel with attentive staff. Just a few steps from the magnificent mile. Our hotel room was larger than expected after reading other reviews. Definitely a great experience and we would stay again. ", 
    "Nice, great location ! Staff ver friendly, helpful and polite !!!", 
    "The high rating and exuberant reviews were a reason for me to book this hotel. It started out good, the hotel is located in north loop, close to many shops, restaurants and pubs. Let's check the ups and downs + Entrance hall is representative and the staff is friendly. - Rooms are mid size, with two and some luggage it fills quickly and a third person would not have a place to sit. - Bathroom is small, with a single person it is completely filled - neighboring rooms can be connected. But sound isolation at these doors is absent and you can follow the conversations in the other room in detail. - no customer washing oppotunities - parking is expensive in Chicago, you pay quickly 40$ a night, this hotel tops that easily and was the most expensive offer I've seen. - on one day we left late, about noon. The room was not cleaned when we returned late evening. + when cleaning is done, it is just fine. + many elevators and you never have to wait long + wifi in room was included!", 
    "Staff was poor customer service. Slow check in and checkout. Receipts for stay were incorrect and staff did not know how to correct them. Placed cash for incidentals on account and always a slow process to get cash back in morning. Will stay somewhere else. Hyatt is usually friendly , but not the Knickerbocker. Staff had poor English. ", 
    "Room was small but very nice. Small bar was good and had a nice breakfast at the hotel the last morning.", 
    "Loved the Martini bar in lobby! Very convenient since it was so cold outside. Hotel staff extremely friendly! Would definitely stay again!", 
    "Great hotel - great location, clean, well run.....only complaint is cost of parking car - however, so goes the big city....", 
    "Fabulous decor and amenities. Excellent value. Staff very professional.", 
    "We didn't spend much time in our room during our weekend in Chicago but the staff and room were to our liking. We had a smaller room without a view but the downtown location made picking up the bus or the red line easy meaning we didn't have to splurge on taxi fare. ", 
    "This is a really good hotel with a great location. The only complaint I had was the in room bar and lack of vending machines. I don't want to spend $3 to buy a coke. Other than that, everyone was helpful and kind and they were able to give a good recommendation of a quick place to eat. The housekeeping staff was very helpful as well. Overall a great place to stay and somewhere I would stay again.", 
    "I would recommend this hotel to anyone. The location is great. It's within walking distance to many shops and a couple of museums. The staff are warm and accommodating. I would definitely stay here again. The only thing about the hotel is the steep security deposit. It wasn't mentioned anywhere in the booking nor when I checked in.", 
    "We have stayed here several times and always find it pleasant. The location is great, close to michigan avenue. Very pleasant and helpful staff. Prompt maid service. Rooms are comfortable and attractive, although room size varies. All in all, a very nice hotel in a great location.", 
    "Stayed one night. Loved the location--right in the heart of it all. Great staff, room. Bathrooms were especially nice. Highly recommend.", 
    "Parking at hotel was $67/night. It would of been nice if the booking agent informed us of this before we booked!! That made the price much less attractive. Not cool!!", 
    "This was our first time in Chicago so the staff was very helpful in making our stay a great experience. Loved the hotel!!!", 
    "I have stayed here seven times over the past 5 years - always great. Fantastic location and hotel. Bar is great and food is outstanding in the restaurant.", 
    "Excellent place to stay for a Chicago visit, just off Michigan Avenue. Close to night life, Navy Pier and Hancock Tower. Excellent staff - very helpful and accomidating. We were upgraded to the King suite for our anniversary. Very nice room, comfortable furniture and every ammenity imaginable. Loved the shower and whirlpool tub combination. Can't wait to go back!!!", 
    "Nice hotel. Clean rooms and friendly staff. Quiet, can't hear the hustle and bustle of the city from your room. No wait time for elevators! ",

    "MostOfThePersonnelWereAwesome. Ali In DiningTerribleAttitude. We NeverWentBackToEatThere. i",

    "Great customer service.... very accommodating.... Best bartenders....", 
    "Good hotel, centrally located to Michigan Ave shops and entertainment", 
    "Comfortable room and wi-fi included in the price. Breakfast off the lobby good and reasonable. Weekend edition of the Wall St Journal free. I was a happy camper.", 
    "Lounge! Excellent Piano player during happy hour and amazing trio that evening!", 
    "short weekend getaway for us. Despite the frigid cold temperatures, we felt a warm welcome every time we entered the door", 
    "Very pleasant. I was actually surprised about the condition and cleanness of the hotel. I plan on staying there on future trips.", 
    "I stayed for three nights for a romantic getaway. It was a nice hotel and clean and comfortable. The weather was terrible though and made sightseeing hard. We had a great time anyway and the staff was very good.", 
    "The hotel was very beautiful and everything was very clean. The staff was helpful. The room was on the smaller side but still adequate for a king-sized bed.", 
    "The desk clerk (male) was very rude about our wifi service the next morning that included in the hotel offer & told me I could come downstairs to speak to someone really !!!! Instead of reviewing the offer never got an apology once he was proven wrong . Didn't appreciate that.", 
    "Hotel staff was very friendly and accomodating. We arrived for late check in and were upgraded to a junior suite! It was very roomy and spacious. We loved the room and were greatful to be put in such a nice suite, however there were a lot of lights burned out in the room and was not fond of the showers (but just minor things!) other than that we loved our stay! So close to shopping etc! Restaurant had delicious food! We would recommend this hotel and loved our stay!", 
    "I stay in hotels all the time and the Knickerbocker was outstanding. Old hotel charm but beautifully renovated with first class ameneties. Rooms were cozy, comfortable, just the right temp, quite and well appointed. Service was good, breakfast delicious and fitness room complete. Okay....$67 per night to park your car is a little steep, but that's Chicago.", 
    "Great location, excellent quality room for the price, the people were friendly and helpful for a tourist like me. The ambiance in the lobby bar was very nice.", 
    "Valentine's day weekend loved this hotel", 
    "Cold temperatures had the hot water working hard to keep up....but the stay was a good one!",

    "Great hotel but very difficult to get a taxi out of at night.", 
    "Great stay. Good location. Very clean room and modern. Quiet and friendly ", 
    "Very small room and bathroom. Friendly staff and great location. Would stay there again, but it's definitely an older hotel. ", 
    "The hotel was really nice.It was a little noisy if you are trying to get away for peace and quiet. Very close to shopping and restaurants. There is not any microwaves or fridges in the rooms to reheat food and no pool. Staff was very friendly and helpful. They charge your card for 150 to cover any thing taken from the minibar in your room and refund it after check out", 
    "The staff and hotel were awesome!", 
    "The bathrooms are updated and very nice. The rooms are okay with a stocked refrigerator, but the cost of the items is excessive. We had to 'purchase' one of the toothbrushes for $6 then found out at check out they also had complimentary ones. The carpets were quite drab and needing to be updated. Otherwise the rooms were okay. ", 
    "lovely...very quiet, clean. staff was very courteous and friendly.", 
    "My wife and I love Chicago. We also love the Knickerbocker and have stayed there twice in the last six months.", 
    "We booked that hotel for his location and needed a place to sleep and take showers. Total fail! We had a room with 2 double beds. One bed was broken. No hot water. The only thing that the front desk did was to change us room. This time it was taking 20 min to get warm water (not warm/hot enough to wash your hair). I slept better in a 2 stars hotel in a 3rd world country. Be aware that the hotel charges $75 usd/day as a deposit and it takes 3-7 business days for them to refund you after your stay.", 
    "Upon arriving, there was no TV remote in the room. We called down, they said they would send one right up. We waited an hour, the remote never came, we called AGAIN. They AGAIN said they would come right up. Another hour goes by,still no remote, and we leave for our evening activities. Still no remote upon our return to the room five hours later. Only when we called down again THE NEXT MORNING, did they bring up a remote. IN ADDITION, the computer in the room DID NOT WORK, we called the help desk extension about it, and got billed for making a local call.", 
    "upscale and classy, valet service was very good, room had good view including lake michigan, bed was VERY comfortable plus flat screen tv. all in all a good place to stay in downtown chicago !!", 
    "I was in Chicago for business. 10 min cab ride to where we had to go for work. At night great restaurants around. Rush St is 2 blocks away. Great shopping and restaurants. If it wasn't so cold while we were there we could have walked a couple of blocks to the River. It seemed centrally located and would definitely stay here again.", 
    "Went downtown for a Bachelorette Party. Me and a friend got a room together. We loved it. Very nice. Especially for the unbeatable price! The party planners even included the Murder Mystery Dinner as a part of the weekend festivities. It was so convenient having everything in the hotel.", 
    "It was a wonderful hotel. Great location and everything was clean and comfortable. Everything you could ask for.", 
    "The staff was very friendly and helpful. It was our first time in Chicago and they answered any questions we had. ", 
    "Enjoyed the city, dining and shopping. Hotel staff were very helpful with directions and suggestions. Price of room was very reasonable. Room was clean, comfortable and accommodating. My daughter and I drove however, and parking was outrageous. We were told the parking garage across from the hotel didn't take credit, only cash. That left us with hotel valet parking which for us, was crazy expensive, approaching the cost of our room. Would caution travelers about parking costs at hotels in Chicago,.We would plan ahead next time with a different plan for parking (although it was very convenient), this was our only disappointment. ", 
    "We have stayed here many times ----twice a year----for a trade show we always attend. We love the location ----just off Michigan ave ----one block from water tower shopping. Everything is fine -----beds very comfortable ----attractive bathroom. Small boutique hotel. Shower needs a bench of some sort -----for ladies shaving legs ----& doors were put on in way that you get blasted & soaked with freezing cold water as you reach in to turn on water more soap needed as well ! Think we had one little bar total in bath.", 
    "No room service. No high definition channels. Annoying computer monitor with ads.", 
    "Took my son for college visits. Location was perfect. Close to restaurants, shops and public transportation. It's a grand old hotel with personality.", 
    "Just here for a night. Was fabulous! Awesome!", 
    "Horrible. Rude staff, unclean rooms. We booked a King and were given a queen room. No apology, nothing. Furniture and rooms are dingy and dirty. I would not recommend this place.", 
    "Great", 
    "I work at a five star, five diamond hotel in Beverly Hills, so I expect exceptional service everywhere (including McDonalds) and am rarely satisfied with costumer service now. However, I was quite pleased with the service here, the bellboy was always very helpful and the front desk even upgraded our room for free. Plus there was free pizza and wings at the bar downstairs for the Super Bowl. The drinks at the martini bar were very good also. Would recommend.", 
    "Great hotel close to Water Tower Place. Easy 6 block walk to the nearest CTA line. Beds were very comfortable.", 
    "The hotel is situated in a great location within blocks of Michican Avenue, Oak and the lake. The room was perfectly laid out and spacious for a non-suite.", 
    "I will start by admitting that I love the Millennium Knickerbocker. I love the feel, the ambiance, and the location. The small bar feels like it is there just for me. The only unfortunate part is that the place is starting to look a little threadbare, little worn out. Some updates would do nicely. There are too many other options available to let these little things go by unnoticed.", 
    "Great", 
    "Great room, comfortable and quiet.", 
    "It was great, great location, great customer service. Enjoyed my stay.", 
    "My husband and I flew in for a brief trip to Indiana. He was coming for an interview, and I tagged along to spend a few days with our daughters and grandson. We only stayed one night at the Knickerbocker, but the entire stay was second to none! Extremely attentive and friendly staff, immaculate room, and delicious dining all contributed to me rating the hotel as A 5-star establishment!", 
    "I have stayed here a few times. It's always clean, friendly and comfortable. I would stay here again. The location is good and in a nice area.", 
    "We had a nice stay at the Knickerbocker. Room was small, and we found the bed a bit too soft, but it was quiet and clean and in the perfect location for shopping and dining.", 
    "The hotel has charm with updated modern feel in parts. Our door was busted, as the spring did not work, so the door would slam shut every time. Also, we clumsily left our tablet behind, amidst the chaos of the winter storm at the hotel and lost and found 'claim' they couldn't locate it. Also couldn't check in for our flights because the computers in the business centers were slow, and also didn't recognize the airline website.", 
    "What a beautiful hotel! Easy to get to taking public transportation from MDW. Near the Water Tower and Cheesecake Factory (yum)! Hotel restaurant has amazing food for reasonable prices. Room was gorgeous with lighted closet, safe, mini bar, and bathroom. Rooms are updates nicely with a rain shower I indulged in! I would definitely stay there again the next time I travel to Chicago.", 
    "Great hotel at a great price! We were even given a more spacious room due to a birthday weekend visit and a lack of peak season traffic! My only complaint would be noisy neighbors at times, but nothing the hotel could necessarily control, and it wasn't enough to keep us awake or too disturbed. ", 
    "The hotel was very nice and updated for an older hotel. We got a great rate on Expedia which made it even better! The service at the hotel restaurant was very slow, but the food was good.", 
    "I wanted to do something special for my girlfriend's birthday and found a great deal on this historically spectacular hotel. We got exactly what we expected. Beautiful hotel, comfortable bed, fantastic location. My only suggestion would be for the shower head(s) to be updated. It wasn't my favorite set-up. But it wouldn't keep me from staying there again!", 
    "Staff was very nice. Rooms were small and the hotel itself was a little run down. But, great location. If you can get for a good price, I would recommend staying here. ", 
    "Ho soggiornato per una sola notte per una breve viaggio d'affari Hotel buono in un'ottima posizione", 
    "The staff is spot on, and friendly. Hotel is super clean.", 
    "Loved our stay at the Knickerbocker! We have stayed there before and received the great service and friendliness! This time we took advantage of the bar/ music later in the night..... we loved it! Thank you!!", 
    "Great experience, I would book here again. Perfect location, great bar, friendly staff.", 
    "We spent the weekend in Chicago after a trade show near Ohare airport . The Knickebocker was fantastic !! Located right off Michigan Ave close to shops and restaurants . The room was a decent size and was completely remodeled ! Staff was friendly and very helpful ! Parking was a little expensive at $67 a night but the great price on the room made up for it ! We would definitely stay again !! John n Denise", 
    "Came into Chicago for almost a week. The Knickerbocker was the perfect hotel. It had the class and sophistication of Chicago combined with modern chic decor. Everything about the hotel was great. SOME of the front desk crew weren't the most welcoming but other than that, I'd definitely recommend it to anyone.", 
    "Great historic hotel, great location! Rooms are a bit small for space surrounding a King size bed, but great value for rate. Overall very pleased with stay and would definitely recommend it.", 
    "Will definitely stay again.", 
    "Great location, good service, clean...just wished they would have had free wi-fi. I also did not like paying an extra $20.00 for a roll away bed.", 
    "Very nice hotel, room a bit small, but to be expected in an older hotel. Service was excellent and accomodating. Very clean room. Shower was a joke, terrible water pressure. Parking nuts, almost as much as our room rate, ridiculous, but that's Chicago. I just don't get it. Elevators a bit slow too.", 
    "I was looking for an opportunity to see friends in Chicago, and a great price on a great hotel seemed like just the ticket. It's very close to many different things in River North, and it's only 14 stories, so it's not a mega-hotel. Everything is fairly modern, except for the elevators, and that's more about style than anything.", 
    "Most beautiful hotel lobby !", 
    "The bell guys were great - remembered us as we went in and out and very friendly. Sam, the person who checked us in, was also very pleasant. The only downside to this hotel is the elevator bank. Of the 3 elevators only 1 was working on Sunday morning which made for a LONG wait!", 
    "Stay was wonderful and good location. Room was a little smaller than I expected. Elevators were very slow and had to take the stairs twice.", 
    "We came for a 1 night getaway. It was a great place to stay, although the room was a little small.", 
    "Very efficient, friendly service. Noise in ventilator was fixed within 10 minutes of my call to front desk.", 
    "Great location, walking distance to museums, shopping and worl class dinning. The martini bar is cozy, romantic and the service is excellent", 
    "Stayed for a weekend trip to Chicago, had stayed here before a year ago and liked it so much I booked a room again. Nice clean, comfortable beds and rooms. Having all the shops and food within walking distance is fantastic. ", 
    "Loved it. I was very impressed with the quality of service provided by the staff and on how clean the hotel was.", 
    "Excellent historic hotel. Interesting architecture and style. Fairly clean. Helpful staff. Wonderful location. One noted issue was no coffee in room or lobby. Otherwise a great 4/5 experience. ", 
    "Excellent Hotel!", 
    "I enjoyed the suite, particulary the rain shower. ", 
    "Love the shower. Great location. Comfortable bed. Small elevators. Great trip", 
    "Amazing hotel close to everything. Excellent staff friendly and very helpful. Highly recommended.", 
    "Room was not as advertised (did not have tub), phone cover kept falling off (cheap), remote for TV worked sporadically, manager at first refused to provide a room as advertised with no \"upgrade\" charge and then stated would take room from another guest and deal with them separately (we did not want to displace another guest), new room was not stocked with shampoo (took over 10 minutes to receive), accidentally left bottle of wine in first room and, when requested to see if it could be retrieved was told it was probably thrown out ... just an overall disappointing and frustrating experience. Oh, and first room did not have hot water in shower and were told it was because the room had not been occupied recently so hot water was not easily reaching that floor. Did ultimately receive full comp (upon information and belief ... still need to confirm credit card/bank account) but only after lengthy, unnecessary, and persistent complaining. Considering the overall competition for hotels in downtown Chicago, we expected better customer service. Will not stay here again.", 
    "We had a great time. The hotel was cozy and comforting. The condition was great, we only had a problem trying to get the hot water to work. What the hotel lacked in hot water delivery they made up for with everything else. We walked every where, most places are within the mile. ", 
    "Good stay. Solid performance by all. Great location. Great price considering the neighborhood. Room small but clean. Not a lot of modern services but for under $100 it's a great option. Old-fashioned but nice.", 
    "We always have a great time when we stay there. Location is excellent and the best bang for the buck in that area. Hotel lobby bar is q special place.", 
    "Very nice place. Great service. Great martinis. Very clean and classy.", 
    "Excellent hotel for the price. Double rooms much bigger than King room. Got a corner room with double windows. Hotel staff very nice and eager to please. When I mentioned I was high maintainable and to please give me a nice room he put us in the corner room ;) can't hurt to ask :) lobby was ok but nothing beautiful to look at. That was really my only complaint. Very convenient to all. Mich ave 1/2 block away. Great history at hotel. Try to make the tour on Friday at 3. We missed it but wish we didn't! Kids loved the 'secret' passages.", 
    "I had a very good stay the customer service was really great!I will be staying there again ,I absolutely love that hotel", 
    "Great bar! Staff friendly and helpful.", 
    "Great location and a great history went along with this hotel. A little frustrated with the service fee for wifi. Overall it was a wonderful place to stay just off Michigan Avenue.", 
    "Perfect spot for a weekend get away. Walking distance to shopping, restaurants and sights!", 
    "My only complaint was that the room was stuffy. I couldn't open the window. But other than that it was excellent and a great price.", 
    "Visited the Knickerbocker when we were visiting downtown Chicago on a spontaneous \"Staycation\". Had a great time. It is older but updated in excellent condition. The staff was friendly, and we loved the Martini Bar and jazz performance. We will be back next time the mood grips us.", 
    "Great location , very friendly and helpful staff", 
    "Helpful staff, ideal location! Will stay here again.", 
    "Excellent hotel & excellent service! Very clean and super comfy! Best hotel I've stayed in!", 
    "Nice place for a quick trip. Friendly staff with clean room although somewhat small.", 
    "The staff at the Millennium Knickerbocker were very helpful and polite. The elevator is extremely small and the room was nice but the beds were terrible. All four members of my family woke up with backaches in the morning. The location is perfect for having fun downtown.", 
    "Excellent location, friendly staff, clean and comfortable room. Fantastic price. Would definitely stay here again!", 
    "We stayed for two nights, it was my wife and I 6 yr anniversary. The hotel and service were great all weekend. We had breakfast there as well, which was superb. My wife had the chorizo wrap and I their French toast, overall it was a great stay with friendly staff.", 
    "This hotel was clean and cozy. The restaurant serves an excellent breakfast, and the staff was quite accommodating.", 
    "Nice, relaxing and comfortable. Guest services was attentive and unnoticeable. Millenium Loyalty.", 
    "We came to Chicago to help our granddaughter celebrate her birthday, and this hotel was in a perfect location! Shopping and restaurants were within short walking distance. The hotel was lovely, and all employees were friendly and helpful. We would definitely return!", 
    "I booked a one night stay at the Knickerbocker on a Saturday for me and my boyfriend for his birthday. The location is very close to the train so it was very easy for us to get to the hotel without a car. The hotel is surrounded by great restaurants, shopping, bars, and other great attractions like cafe's, salons, coffee shops, etc. Our room was on the 11th floor and it was absolutely perfect for us. Our room had a very comfortable king size bed, a jacuzzi bathtub, flat screen tv with HBO movies that we watched all night, a full stocked fridge, and our view was nice too. We got dinner at the Cheesecake Factory which was a 3 minute walk from our hotel. ", 
    "Very pleased with my stay. I enjoyed how clean this hotel was.", 
    "Had a room on the 11th floor that included a slice view of the lake. I was expecting the room to be loud as it was around the corner from the elevators, but in reality (or maybe I was one of few occupied rooms on this floor) I slept wonderfully with no interruptions. In the morning, the shower took 20 minutes for hot water but since it was before 6AM I didn't take this as a detraction since I was probably one of the first to run the water on this floor.", 
    "The hotel staff was very welcoming and accommodating. We were able to check in early and book an additional night. The hot water in the hotel room was very irregular and often times warm at best. The sound on the t.v. worked on all channels except HBO. We called the front desk and had a quick and pleasant visit with an engineer, he looked into and had it fixed within 45 minutes. Overall a very good experience.", 
    "I loved the stay and you want to known why because my wife loved it so a happy wife a happy life.", 
    "Not far from the shopping district. Parking is $28 dollars overnight, more for valet. Rooms are clean, minus the vent when you first walk into the room but it's something even I forget to clean in my own house at times. I did not get to eat there for the restaurant was closed at the times I was in the hotel. The bar has the basic and even had a LIVE piano player. I would stay here again, the staff is friendly and very helpful.", 
    "The location was fantastic. The staff was incredible. An the room was very, very clean. The staff was very accommodating, as was the Valet. On the not so positive side: The room was tiny. Very tiny. The heat/cooling fan did not work, or ever turn on. Kind of important in the winter, you would think. There was no exhaust fan in the bathroom (did I mention the room was tiny. Now imagine that mixed with no exhaust fan in the bathroom and a girlfriend who is lactose intolerant). This was my first stay at this hotel, and will be my last. Which is unfortunate, because all the staff was incredible, and the hotel was excellently located.", 
    "I came into town for the weekend with my boyfriend to go to the Bulls game on Saturday evening. The Expedia deal was too good to pass up, so I booked at the Knickerbocker hotel. The staff was very accommodating and the room was very nice - kind of small but that was to be expected. We had a drink at the bar on Saturday night and the service was great. We didn't eat at the hotel but the food looked and smelled phenomenal. ", 
    "Great experience , great location, nice staff, clean and nicely updated. Wish it had cheaper parking and free wifi. Appreciate your customers!", 
    "Great price, location, service, cafe and rooms!", 
    "Clean, safe, friendly and perfect location. While it was expensive to park there, there are in and out privileges at no extra charge. It is convenient to just about everything you'd want to do while in Chicago, whether business or pleasure.", 
    "We enjoyed the history of the place- up until we were trapped in the elevator. Many people we were with for a wedding had experienced issues with the elevator, then it got stuck and we were in there for about 20 minutes. Otherwise, the rooms were nice but small and the staff was friendly but not always accommodating. ", 
    "Great stay. Affordable rate and really close to everything. The staff was very helpful and easy to access. Rooms were large enough and had very large bathrooms. Overall great hotel option.", 
    "Very nice stay, service was great, comfortable bed, wonderful shower and great location. However the room was very small and considering the cost, a complimentary breakfast would have been more appropriate.", 
    "Great location. Bathroom facilities need to be updated;in the shower,the hot water was coming after a long while and at a quite low pressure. Poor isolation of the windows which caused a sensitive difference of temperature between the side of the bed close to the window and the other one. The staff was kind.Worthy the money I spent thanks to its location.", 
    "We enjoyed our stay. Hotel room was very small and only had a desk chair. Not so good for two of us staying 3 days and having snacks and drinks in our room. Bathroom was great, though, and bed and bedding was terrific!! We love the lobby bar, too. Will stay again.", 
    "Great hotel if you can stomach $67.00 each night to park your car. Cleanliness was okay, found several left over pieces of food under our bed and furniture. The rainfall shower was wonderful however. ", 
    "Beautiful hotel conveniently located near the Michigan street shopping. I had to wait beyond check in time for a room to be available, and when checking out was charged for Internet connection even though it was free with the room. This was quickly corrected on my request. Overall a very nice place to stay.", 
    "New years stay, had good time.", 
    "Hotel staff (front desk, restaurant, bar, etc.) were very helpful and pleasant.", 
    "The hotel was very nice and staff was very friendly. I would not book it again for a few reasons that are purely personal preference. The room only had a shower (no tub) and the water pressure in the shower was horrible. It never really felt like I got totally clean while staying at this hotel. The bed was also extremely soft which sounds nice but I woke up with a backache almost every day. The hotel also did not have room service which really disappointed us because we were having a romantic couple's week away and just didn't want to leave the room for breakfast or late night snacks. When we did call to inquire about room service, the staff did run menus up to us immediately for restaurants that deliver, so they were as helpful as they could have been. We had a great stay at the Millennium Knickerbocker but these small details are the reasons we will likely choose a different hotel on our next stay.", 
    "The hotel is a bit outdated and historic, but charming. The concierge and staff were incredibly friendly and accommodating. The location is fantastic! My only complaint is the size of the room, it was quite small.", 
    "Great location close to shopping, clean and good sized rooms, helpful staff, overall a very nice experience.", 
    "Great place to stay for our quick visit to the city. Cannot beat the location and the rooms are nicely updated.", 
    "The Millennium Knickerbocker is a great location for downtown Chicago activities! The Water Tower Place is practically right around the corner. We easily walked to the Bean @ Millennium Park and onto the Willis Tower lookout. The hotel itself is clean, quiet, and well appointed for your everyday needs. I'd definitely stay here again.", 
    "Had a very nice stay here, but nothing about the hotel would make me rave about it or choose it over something else. Hotel bar was nice.", 
    "The hotel is a nice hotel. We had a double queen, roll in shower room. The hotel was clean and the staff was awesome. The only downfall of the room was it took roughly 10 minutes of constant water running for the water to get somewhat warm. We were on the 8th floor. We told the staff the first night about it and the maintenance staff that was on call was to our room within seconds. He said he would reset the water heater and it should work. We just went with it. The day before end of our stay I wrote a statement on there room computers and they worked with us on a couple things. ", 
    "Girls getaway, so double room, but one robe,refrigerator,which seemed available only for the purpose of overfilling it with their things, in hopes of charging an arm and a leg. No microwave,big inconvenience, not in room or hotel. Called desk for help with screen, never showed up. Room was nice, clean, no view, front desk was a tad bit unprofessional,and, inattentive, I'm from Chicago, so I'm familiar with several hotels, while the decor and location were nice, I wasn't blown away by anything.", 
    "Close to Michigan mile and very affordable! The hotel was great and was in a fabulous location. Will stay there from now on!", 
    "Beautiful hotel, great location, friendly, accomodating staff. Would return anytime.", 
    "Need to take a cab to all museums, but good location for shopping. Door man on first night was not nice when we went to him to ask a question, telling us, \"I'm not the concierge! Don't you see that sign?\" (the sign saying the concierge was gone for the night.) Rude! All other personnel were nice, especially bartender who referred us to 'The Local' restaurant right around the corner for late night food because their kitchen was closed. ", 
    "Friendly staff, great location for shopping!", 
    "For the Price I thought the room would be a little bit bigger. The room was very noisy, I could hear everything going on in the hallway and the room next to us. Also, once we had turned on the heat to warm the room up it would not turn on again to cool the room down even though we had it set to \"fan\" mode. Hotel was nice and well kept but when you need to sleep at the end of the night it is very hard if your neighbors aren't quiet.", 
    "This was a brief stay for my daughter and I to do a little after Christmas shopping. Check-in was a breeze, no line, nice room, a little small but we weren't planning to spend any time other than sleeping in the room. Room was VERY clean. Only complaint was the temp in the room was too warm, temps outside were in the high 50's and we had the thermostat set at 60 but it never cooled down. We tried to open the window but couldn't get it open. Who would think it would be in the 50's at the end of December, right? Only service we used was the bell desk to hold our luggage after we checked out before our flight. EXCELLENT LOCATION!", 
    "Nice room, bed very comfortable. Check in was very good.", 
    "The location is great, a block from Michigan avenue. The hotel staff was friendly and helpful. We did get to our room and there was no tv remote in the room so we had to call for that. The room was small but clean and the bed was comfortable.", 
    "The location is the best!", 
    "This hotel is in an awesome location! Just steps away from Michigan Ave. it was really easy to get to and loved being in the heart of the city. I can't wait to stay there again.", 
    "The Knickerbocker was extremely well located for our purposes (we were in town to see an exhibit at the Museum of Contemporary Art)--close to the museum, the lake, and the hustle and bustle of Michigan Avenue (but far enough away to allow for peace and quiet). The hotel was well appointed, comfortable, and very quiet. Rooms are small, but nicely updated.", 
    "The room was very small but everything else wonderful.", 
    "We were looking to spend the day/evening on North Michigan Avenue. This hotel is conveniently located and nicely kept up.", 
    "2nd trip to hotel...still one of our favorites!", 
    "The room was small but well decorated and comfortable. Parking was outrageous at $65 per night. No Sunday paper, had to walk across the street to the Drake to purchase. Elevators were out of service on Saturday night for a period of time. My expectations were higher.", 
    "We loved our very comfy bed, great location......but, the front desk person.....(Mike was his name) was a complete misrepresentation of the hotel. He was oblivious about how you should treat all incoming guest. It was so bad that I hesitate going back to the establishment", 
    "Great location--was able to check in early and they even upgraded our room. Very clean. Was a little noisy from outside the room but not terrible. Overall, a great value.", 
    "Great service, nice room, excellent location for overnight getaway to Chicago. Would definitely rebook in future.", 
    "The staff were fabulous - nothing was too much trouble! We loved this hotel and will definitely stay here again! ", 
    "Great time in Chicago. Clean hotel, friendly staff ", 
    "The Millenium Knickerbocker offered a pleasant stay - comfortable bed, clean room, nice shower, and in an absolutely prime location! We found a fantastic deal on Hotels.com. Thanks for a great night!", 
    "Great experience, great location fantastic restaurants near by ", 
    "Stayed for my wifes Birthday and the room was nice and was at an excellent price.", 
    "I stayed at this hotel rather than the more expensive one across the street where the convention I was attending was located. The rooms, although slightly smaller, offred the same ammenities as the more expensive hotel. It was quieter nd the staff was very attentive. I would stay here again with no second thoughts.", 
    "Location is pretty good. Staff overall was friendly. Great drinks at the bar! Problems were, the fan didn't work on the air in the room, the computer didn't work in the room, the shower leaked onto the bathroom floor and the exhaust fan didn't work. I told all of this to a guy at the desk when I checked out and he acted like he didn't care and didn't want to hear about it. ", 
    "I really enjoyed my stay at the Knickerbocker. The room was lovely and the service terrific. I booked at hotel.com and got a fabulous rate.", 
    "NICE HOTEL, BUT TO FAR ( FOR MY OPINION) FROM RESTAURANTES", 
    "The bathroom was beautiful, had to get the maintance engineer to turn up the water temp. Then all was great.", 
    "It was fabulous! Lots of character and at the end of all the shopping. All the employees were so great and friendly. Definitely would stay there again.", 
    "Loved this old (but remolded) hotel, in this fancy part of Chicago. People seemed genuinely nice (I think they tell the staff to be yourself, but be nice. No fake \"thank you sir\" stuff here. My only comment, is that they could get the furniture upholstered in the lounge. Loved the Thursday night Flamenco dancing and guitars! Ole!", 
    "We had a terrific time...This hotel met our expectations in many ways...", 
    "Good experience. Nice hotel. Close to the magnificent mile.", 
    "Excellent location staff very helpful and friendly. Room nice and very clean. As there was 3 of us staying in the room we could have done with a comfy chair each, opposed to only 1. However would definitely come back . Martini cocktails delicious x", 
    "Every employee was extremely helpful and friendly.", 
    "Albeit short, the hotel staff are some of the friendliest, most welcoming people I've come across in my stays in Chicago.", 
    "The hotel staff very nice. Decent location and easy walking distance to many shops on Michigan Ave and the night life on Rush St. My biggest complaint was the shower. In order for us to get hot water we had to let the shower run for nearly 15 minutes the first night and even then the temperature fluctuated during the shower. The second night the water didn't warm up within 15 minutes so I gave up. We were driving home early the next morning so I didn't bother calling the front desk. All in all the room was clean and nice. I'd probably stay here again but I'd have to make a call to get the hot water fixed. ", 
    "My wife and I wanted to get away for the weekend , so we choose Chicago . I wanted to pick a hotel with character ,not too modern . If you have the time , look into the tour of the hotel . It is not a long tour but it is interesting to find out about the top floor . The room was updated and clean . The staff was nice and helpful . The hotel is in a great location for all things you need . I would pick this hotel again . ", 
    "We stayed here for my daughter's birthday. The staff went out of their way to make her feel celebrated. We had a wonderful stay. I would definitely stay here again.", 
    "Been looking forward to staying here for a long time. The hotel is in a great place, and is great. The room is really nice and the shower was fantastic. The only drawback was the elevator. I was on the 3rd floor so I could use the stairs, but if you are further up, it could be a pain. There were 2 working elevators and 1 not working. They could only hold 6 people, without bags, and they were slow. Used the stairs a lot!", 
    "The hotel was very close to Water Place mall and Oak St. shopping. Great access to the miracle mile..", 
    "Had a great time. Close to main shopping areas. Staff at Hotel was great. No surprises with room. Food was great in hotel restaurants. ", 
    "The hotel was great although service was less than average.", 
    "Wonderful experience. Had special request which they handled perfectly. Lovely room. Good breakfast. Will be back. ", 
    "The front desk staff and Consear were very helpful. Only complaint is of the rooms look directly into other rooms ", 
    "Very nice & great location.would definitely consider next time in downtown Chicago. Staff was excellent.", 
    "The first room we got smelled like someone just smoked in it. I called the front desk and they said okay we will move you. They took about 25 minutes so I called back. Shortly after someone came up to move us. The next room was much smaller than we had paid for but it was smoke free so we did not say anything. Later that night we wanted to take a hot shower. Come to find out the hot water was not, well hot. I called the front desk again and asked what the deal was. They said they were having issues with the hot water. I asked them was this a all night thing and the lady said to run the hot water in the shower and sink and in about 10 to 15 minitues we would have hot water. The water did get hot and it took all of 15 mins. For the price I would have thought it would have been a better place to stay. ", 
    "Quick and easy check in. Lovely room. Great location.", 
    "I was lucky to get my reservation upgraded to a suite, which was very comfortable and spacious. But I have stayed in the regular rooms previously and they are great as well. The location of this hotel is perfect, just off Michigan Avenue with all the shops. The hotel bar is a great place to stay in the evening (though the piano music was a bit too load). I will definitely recommend this hotel to anyone visiting Chicago.", 
    "I travel about 95% of the month for business spending most of my nights at hotels. The overall quality of service and room was very inline to what I was expecting for the Knickerbocker, yet the deal that I received via Hotels.com was truly exceptional. The staff is incredibly courteous and the rooms reflect the staff in a clean sleek and modern way. Also if your looking to unwind and have a drink, the first floor offers a very reasonable bar (for Chicago prices) that's just a short stumble from your room."

    "This hotel is on Michigan Avenue one block from the Chicago River - fantastic location. Walking distance to shops, restaurants, river tours, Navy Pier, etc. The hotel was clean and the staff was very pleasant. The only (minor) issue I had is that one of their upgraded rooms (on the 39th floor) appears to be a converted utility space, for which they charge a premium price. We were unhappy with the lighting (unlighted hallway that separates the room from the bathroom), layout (a utility door to the emergency stairwell is right next to the bed), and view (you look over a barrier on the roof to see the view). The staff gave us a new room right away when we told them we weren't happy. Other than that, and the fact that you have to pay for internet connectivity, I was happy with our stay.", 
    "Great location and very friendly staff! The particular room was one of the tiniest I've ever seen, but functional. ", 
    "Rooms were very clean but a little small. The staff is friendly. It is very well located on the magnificent mile!", 
    "Great place, should tell you ahead of time that there is a $67 per night parking fee", 
    "Fantastic place to stay and great location. Highly recommend it. ", 
    "The room itself was fine. There was a lot of functional comfort, and nice touches like the charging station on the alarm clock, but there were some holes too. I called a week before and asked for extra pillows. I made the same request during check-in and over the course of 4 days never got them. Speaking of check-in, the 375$ 'incidentals hold' would have been nice to receive advance warning of. No one likes to have a surprise 400$ chunk taken or held out of their account. Also the coffee maker was a sad experience. A real coffee maker is a one time investment. If people can have them in an office, surely a hotel room can manage one.", 
    "Great hotel on Michigan Ave just north of the River. Close to Apple Store, Bandera's Restaurant, Andy's Jazz Club , Shaw's Crab House and Joe's Steakhouse. Michael Jordan's Steakhouse off the Lobby. Plenty of cheaper eateries just west of Michigan Avenue. Has great Art Deco pool. My only negative was the weird carpet which is supposed to have a weathered look which was really successful. I thought it was just on my floor and that they must be renovating but it is the carpet theme throughout. Talked to some of the staff and was told this was a conscious choice of decor. ", 
    "Old hotel room too small. Staffs are not friendly.", 
    "The rooms were nice - pillows were great! The lobby was very busy and there weren't enough people at the desk to accommodate the line of customers. That was a bit frustrating. However, the staff was friendly.", 
    "I really enjoyed my stay. The room was excellent and the staff was exemplary - from the front desk to the bell captain to the concierge, they all made my stay better with their service!", 
    "Went for a night out with my daughters who are 4 & 9. The min depth of the pool is 4 ft. and goes to 10 ft. My 9 year old is a great swimmer, and she was not happy in the pool. she complains that the sides Phelps fly me to if she tried to hold on. the room was pretty small and cramped which I know is pretty usual for the area. However we noticed a ton of dust all over the fixtures along the ceiling. We weren't looking for it but it kind of grossed us out none the less. The location is fabulous! Close walking distance to everything.", 
    "Newly remodeled rooms are beautiful. Proximity to navy pier and lakefront is perfect. ", 
    "Great location, on the magnificent mile, near rush street and Navy pier. comfortable beds, even the coffee maker and glasses were spotless, most beautiful pool in Chicago. Room was a little small but doable, parking was $67 a day ouch", 
    "Some elevator issues. Took a while to get up and down the modern tower. ", 
    "We had a great time at the hotel, definitely memorable way to spend our 25th wedding anniversary!", 
    "hotel was nice and close to a lot of attractions we wanted to see. Also very accessible to the red line needed to get to Wrigley field. Only down side was we reserved a double bed room and when we checked in they really didn't care much that they were over booked. To make it right they did send a roll away bed to the room but we were told that they were out of pillows, go figure. The next day we had a great lady name Shayla who was really apologetic and got us into the proper room and really took care of us. I would go back based on the experience with Shayla and because of the location of the hotel.", 
    "The hotel was great, very clean, great staff and the room was in mint condition. Located in the heart of Chicago Downtown it was very easy to walk to many restaurants and shops. The only thing that I noticed was odd, was the loudness of the room heater. It was considerably louder than most HVAC systems that I have seen, making sleep a bit tougher than usual.", 
    "Hotel in a great location. Starbucks within the hotel! Bob at the Concierges Desk (probably the most important position in the hotel for guests) was wonderful. He was so helpful and has a great personality. My sister-in-law also stayed at this hotel last Spring Break a year ago, and she told me that Bob was so nice and very helpful to her too. The Bellman who looks like a Jamie Fox was so nice and charming; and, wow, he is handsome!! The only drawback to the room was the fan on the air conditioner was always on unless you turned the whole unit off, and it blew directly on you in bed. ", 
    "The Hotel concierge was not friendly but overall the stay was nice.", 
    "The overall cleanliness of the hotel was managed well. I was disappointed in four primary areas; there was a $12 charge, plus tax, to use the fitness center, we were in long lines to get access to a room to be told a room was not available and had to stay in the long line again to retrieve a key, check-in staff did not treat everyone in our large party (10) very well, and there was not an adequate level of seating in the lobby area for guests. I've stayed at other hotels on Michigan Ave, have paid less, and received better levels of service. I was expecting more.", 
    "Room a bit barren. Bed, TV, empty space. Is this enough info, thanks.", 
    "Fine accommodations. Great location. Room was fairly large but sparsely furnished. It looked as though they'd removed a lounge chair and that left a big empty space. Bathroom was average and had absolutely no counter space. Lighting was bad in the bathroom as well. I can't rave or complain about anything; the lobby is small but nice, front desk and bell staff was friendly, rooms were fine. I will say the elevators ran smoothly and the hotel was packed--that's a plus. And, it was quiet. I'd stay here again if the price was right but I wouldn't pay a premium for this hotel. You expect a certain level of service and accommodation at an InterContinental hotel and we're not sure this met expectations, if we'd paid a higher rate we'd be very disappointed.", 
    "Had a great time at the hotel. Friendly staff; top-notch service; beautiful pool that stays open late.", 
    "We've stayed here many times, and love the hotel and location. ", 
    "Booked this as an unpublished rate/hotel. Asked for a late check in and a king bed. Was given an absolutely huge corner room in the renovated tower on the 31st floor. Spectacular view. Incredibly comfortable bed. I tend to dislike sleeping in hotels and have issues with insomnia, but I fell asleep in a heartbeat. Huge sparkling clean bathroom with a separate tub. We were only staying a night but I didn't want to leave. ", 
    "Would stay again in a heartbeat. Right on mag mile. Starbucks on site a plus.", 
    "The room was a bit smaller than I would have predicted or liked. The pool and fitness center were very nice. The hotel staff was very accommodating, however I would not stay here again not would I recommend this hotel to a friend.", 
    "The entire staff tried to make a guests stay pleasurable. What a nice experience", 
    "my daughter and Zi were there for a Stylemax Trade Show and it was in an excellent location. ", 
    "they renew the rooms in a top floors which they so nice ", 
    "We enjoyed our stay and the hotel is excellently sited on Michigan Ave. but it is irritating to be charged for internet access, $15.00/day, and health club access, $12.00/day, at a time when the lowly Motel 6 offers these amenities for free. ", 
    "I have always been aware that parking is $67 a night, but thought that the Expedia deal included parking, just assumed, was very disappointed to find out when I checked out that I owed for 2 nights parking, wondering how much I really saved by using Expedia?", 
    "Very pleasant and courteous stay. Short walk to all business centers, very easy access to cabs as hop on, hop off. They Magnificient Mile is kept very clean and most important very safe. I would defitly go back and this time enjoy as a tourist.", 
    "Everything was great! Staff was very nice, helpful and accommodating. Very convenient location to everything in downtown Chicago. Comfy room and don't miss the junior olympic pool and workout facility which is amazing!", 
    "I was unimpressed by the room size, very small quarters. The beds were doubles and the bathroom was small as well. The water pressure in the shower was not very strong. The parking price was EXTREMELY overpriced. My best experience was the man in the bell hop at the front of the hotel. He was very kind and generous with his assistance even though he was busy!", 
    "I would not recommend this hotel. They charge you for everything. I had to have them lock the mini bar because they said if we move anything they would charge us the full price of the item that was moved. The hotel only allows 3 people to a room (this is not stated on their website). They also charge you for any local calls that you make. They gym is not available to everyone. If you want to use the gym they charge you $12.00 a day. The staff was not friendly. They make you feel like you are not worth their time and that they are better than you. It was unbelieveable. While talking to the staff at registration they kept saying that their hotel is not the same as other hotels, aren't all hotels different?? It was like they were doing us a favour.", 
    "I reserved three months ago...... Standard Room $210 Rate (with Breakfast) Room was too standard........ The adress is really good for all our schedule. Consierge really good...... (he help us many times) Food was good ++ the hotel facilities are oldies (in the limit) I think they capture our loyalty if they offer an upgrade considering they have lower rates when we check in on march.", 
    "Very unhelpful staff. Reservation problems. Greed.", 
    "Very nice hotel. Great location near all the stores. ", 
    "Rooms were small. We had a room with two double beds with 3 people and we were on top of each other all the time. The staff was great. I think paying for internet service in a hotel of this stature is ridiculous. ", 
    "Compared to other hotels we tried, this room was nicest. Awesome pool. Beware in-room snacks / mini bar calling out for you at outrageous prices. ", 
    "all in all, nice place to stay. but, our room's hvac was extremely noisy- to the point we had to turn it off to sleep. room was a bit cramped, especially at entrance but view was good and location is excellent. would stay again", 
    "Intercontinental is located on a great spot, not far from the train station and directly on The Mile. The hotel overall was very clean and well kept but not kid friendly in any way. It is also old fashioned in the fact that internet is not included and almost everything is an up charge. We actually received a charge for a drink in the refrigerator after it was tipped over which generated an automated charge. The pool was nice, but separated for lap swimming and not a good shallow end for kids. I would probably not stay here again since I travel for business (do not want to pay for internet) or I travel with family (zero kid benefits).", 
    "The location is great but the amenities are not too updated. Besides, you have to pay for the wifi. ", 
    "Beautiful hotel, great staff and perfect location on michigan avenue ", 
    "Fantastic stay! Cab service so convenient. Loved the Magnificent Mile! ", 
    "Superb location. Great quality hotel. Amazing value when you consider you have the best of Chicago on your doorstep. Stores including Nordstrom, a shopping mall and lots of lovely shops directly opposite. Macys, Bloomingdales, Apple, Nike and another huge mall just down the street. Bit of a squeeze for 4 people in the room with 2 double beds, but it's workable. Breakfast is good (buffet style, lots of options) and is better value to pre-pay than to pay when you're there unless you won't have the breakfast every day. Starbucks in the lobby is open from 6am every day. Beware the usual vastly inflated hotel prices for water, snacks etc from the minibar. Get your supplies from the Walgreens across the street in the Wrigley Building and you'll save a fortune. Pool is superb although some of the guests (understandably) don't appreciate young children having a loud splash-about so it's a good idea to choose your times carefully to avoid the very early mornings or evenings when business people are more likely to be using the facilities. The changing rooms are well equipped and the showers are good (better than shower in room). Didn't use the fitness equipment but there's plenty to choose from. Free wifi if you join the hotel's loyalty scheme while you're there (or if you're already a member of IHG). Bus stop right outside which will take you to all the (amazing) museums. Excellent staff and altogether an extremely pleasant stay. Will be staying here again.", 
    "Great location. Bed comfortable. Bath products nice. Nice staff. Room 960. Window drafty. In this day and age, charging for WiFi is just cheesy. Even 2-3 star properties give free Wifi.", 
    "Three days in Chicago for sghtseeing, museums, shops and restaurants", 
    "Enjoyed a Romantic Valentines Day weekend at the hotel. Hotel was centrally located and had great amenities.", 
    "We had the King Deluxe in the old tower for a Valentine's Day getaway. Nice enough room, but nothing special for a hotel with such a high rating. Mini fridge was warm, very slow elevators, no sitting furniture other than the bed, no hairdryer until we called, ice located three floors down and was shut off, and the parking is VERY expensive. Most of the staff was very professional, but one was relatively rude when we told him about the fridge. I will definitely pick different similarly rated hotel in the future.", 
    "Location was very convenient to shopping and dining.", 
    "The room was very clean and had everything that we needed. The view was marvelous! I could see Michigan Avenue just outside my window. The staff was friendly and helpful. You can't beat the location! I highly recommend it if you need a weekend getaway or if you are staying there on business. I've stayed at hundreds of hotels and this ranks as one of the best!", 
    "Hotel was lovely; staff was snooty. Just because one has money doesn't mean one is entitled or is a snob. It was difficult to tell who was more distasteful; the clientele or the staff. I'll take my money elsewhere thankyouverymuch.", 
    "The room was clean but it was a little small. Location is perfect and located near all the wonderful shopping on Michigan Avenue. The hotel robs were very thin and cheap. I would stay at this hotel again.", 
    "Got asked on my room preference but wasn't always available. 3 out of 3 stays will be enough for me. ", 
    "It was an ok hotel, but I wouldn't stay again. While it might seem strange, the carpet in the hallways was AWFUL, it looked like a huge mistake, The green and the brown, just horrible. Also, the room was small and the bathroom was dated. And finally, my main complaint is overnight parking was a whopping $67 per night. I thought Vegas was bad at $25.00 per night, but $67 per night is just asinine", 
    "it cost 67 for a overnight parking and 39 for 2 and a half hour... If you have a car, never park here!", 
    "The suites are worth the upgrade. Pretty views of Michigan ave", 
    "I HAD A HORIBLE EXPERIENCE WITH THIS HOTEL NEVER AGAIN WILL I STAY HERE! I'M STILL WAITING FOR MY REFUND THAT WAS PROMISED", 
    "Older, but very nice hotel. Rooms are a bit small, but very comfortable. The amenities are impeccable and hotel staff was magnificent! Plus, you can't go wrong in this neighborhood as there is something for everyone.", 
    "Great stay. Excellent location. Professional staff", 
    "For example, the front staff was very friendly enough to find out my membership number since I didn't bring it with me. ", 
    "overall disappointing, the rooms are old and dated, and the hotel staff was not adequately responsive this is far from a 4-star hotel ", 
    "We checked into our room and it was much smaller than anticipated. It was also dirty. There were stains all over the lampshade and on the windowsill. I called to switch rooms and ask for an upgrade. They were will to change rooms but they weren't willing to give us a discount on an upgrade. We ended up paying for a larger, nicer room, and only after asking them multiple times did they give me $25 off the room. Also, the woman at the front desk forgot to send s cot up to our room. I was surprised at the low quality of the room as this hotel was once one of the better on the mag mile. We stayed away from the newer boutique hotels bc we thought the rooms at IC would be much bigger. We thought wrong. We also had to pay $12 just to use the workout equipment.", 
    "Not bad for the price and location. Awesome neighborhood, parking costs were insane. And DON'T even TOUCH the pistachios because they'll charge you for just picking them up!", 
    "Always an amazing place to stay in Chicago.", 
    "Average to below average for this hotel, I dont know the hype about this hotel, nothing spectacular other than it is located in michigan ave heart of the magnificent mile, room is too cramp and be careful looking in your frig, it is rig if one of the drinks is misplace you are going to be charge.", 
    "Rooms very small", 
    "We stayed in a two bedroom which was small in size. Very nice indoor pool & workout facility. It is convenient that Starbucks is located next to lobby area. We also had many restaurants at walking distance from hotel.", 
    "We asked for an accessible room for various space needs and what we received was a disappointment. Housekeeping stopped on day two when we were there and never came back. The room looked as if it hadn't been updated in a while. I could be wrong on this but that's the way it appeared to us. The one bright spot was the location. It was good.", 
    "Great hotel in a great location. Very nice rooms, shower, and restaurant. Parking was the most expensive I have ever seen even when compared to Tokyo, London, or NYC.", 
    "The hotel its situated in a very convenient location, quick five minute walk to Millenium Park and all of its attractions. The service is pretty good, no complains for that aspect at all. I must say that valet parking its a bit pricey, and there is no park your self. You can still park In the street at your own risk, and then walk to the hotel. The breakfast was included with our room and it was good.", 
    "I booked a 2 night getaway at this hotel for my kids and myself, mainly because of location and that it has a pool.The hotel staff was very courteous upon checking in. Once inside the average sized room I noticed there wasn't enough towels and the the window shade was broken. I called the front desk and alerted them to these two things. The receptionist told me she was going to let housekeeping know we needed more towels and let maintenance know about the window shade. Housekeeping came within the next few minutes with more towels but maintenance never came, neither day. It was a little disappointing because we had a good view of Michigan Ave and I like natural light. The pool was bigger than expected but I didn't like there wasnt enough room for open swim or playing. The six lanes were set up for laps. Maybe a few lane markers could be taken out so kids can have room to play and really enjoy the pool. The location of the hotel is perfect. You will be in the thick of it all. Steps away from mass shopping and restaurants. All in all we enjoyed our little getaway from the norm.", 
    "The hotel staff was very accommodating for our needs and requests. The room was clean and comfortable.", 
    "We had a blast!! Great location on Michigan Avenue in downtown Chicago!! Room service was excellent!! I will definitely be returning on my next vacation!", 
    "Although I cannot say anything bad about the hotel, I feel it does not have anything special, except the pool. ", 
    "Love the hotel and it is in the heart of everything I love about the city", 
    "This is a great place to stay. It is very conveniently located.", 
    "Loved the location. Rooms were small, but we were hardly in them anyway so it worked out fine.", 
    "Overall good stay, received complementary WIFI during stay , staff very friendly, check in and out a breeze. Only cons our room was near the elevators heard patrons long into the night. Bathroom was in need of cosmetic repairs. Water stains on vanity area wallpaper pealing etc. room #860", 
    "Only concern was room was too hot. Otherwise everything was comfortable and clean.", 
    "Room was a little tight but still an excellent place to stay. ", 
    "The phone was difficult to use try not using wireless phone keep it simple. No one answers the phone promptly either", 
    "Staff was friendly , elevators were backed up. Rooms and bathrooms outdated and small", 
    "Quarto muito pequeno. Atendimento fraco. Elevador um caos. Estacionamento muito caro: U$ 67 por dia.", 
    "Great service and wonderful comfort. Very quiet despite being full of guests. My wife and I would stay here again gladly. And location location location !", 
    "Great hotel, excellent neighborhood, service, food, concierge, everything. Rooms are small tough, but nice.", 
    "We thoroughly enjoyed our stay--it was a return visit.", 
    "Attended a family wedding and stayed the weekend. While everything about the hotel is great, at peak times, they were obviously understaffed, and the elevators need a waiting area. Both are extremely slow at the worst times.", 
    "Fantastic hotel. Well designed, clean and the staff were very helpful and accommodating to anything asked of them. Especially all the concierges who's recommendation were fantastic every time. Would recommend to everyone and you will not get a hotel in a better location.", 
    "Overall we liked the room, the location and the service was really great. The only thing that bummed me out was the pool area- the pool only had swimming lanes built in, so it wasn't set up for a free-swim situation, and there was no hot tub- something I think they need there. Otherwise, a nice place.", 
    " My stay was to short,. but sweet and comfortable . I look forward to returning again very soon", 
    "Great location.", 
    "Great hotel in a fantastic location!", 
    "Everything was great but the air conditioning unit was so noisy we had to turn the heat off even though it was the coldest time of the year. Bathtub was so annoying to adjust temperature I am actually writing about it. Everything else about the hotel was superb. Complimentary Starbucks vouchers for 2 free drinks at the Starbucks located in the lobby. The bar was more than accommodating for the 4 wine glasses we needed.", 
    "Very expensive, poor quality. I stayed in many hotel in Down Town Chicago and this is the worst. Cost-quality is poor. They charge you for everything, and is very expensive!", 
    "Staff was very pleasant, helpful, nice having the steak house and Starbuck on the premises.. Kinda expected a lil more wow factor with the accommodations.. Definitely noticed some wear and tear in the bathroom area, could be better..... Maids were very good with cleaning the room on a daily basis, the mini bar was fully stocked, and lots of Outlets in the room... The Historic part of the hotel is beautiful, almost Castle like, very nice....", 
    "I really enjoyed my stay. The hotel was in a great location, and the staff was extremely friendly and helpful.", 
    "Hotel is fine. We were only there for sleeping. Staff is friendly. Hotel is immaculate. Only complaint is size of elevators and wait to get one. There were lines to get on one of the four elevators almost constantly and they only held 6-8 people and if there was a bellhop with a luggage cart, only 2 or 3 could fit. A minor inconvenience, but and inconvenience nonetheless. No complaints otherwise. Checkin was fast and easy and very friendly staff.", 
    "We were celebrating our anniversary! We had a king suite overlooking Michigan ave. The room was absolutely beautiful! Very clean! I'm very paticular and was very happy! My only complaint...and its a big one, is that the bedding (the blanket)looked and felt like a mattress pad.The one that's between the sheets I found that to be really gross for such a high end hotel!", 
    "Did not like the service at front desk", 
    "This is a great place to stay. The staff are very professional and friendly. The breakfast buffet is excellent and the pool is a one of a kind phenomenal experience! My only complaint is the idiot parents who don't control their idiot kids.", 
    "Just a night out away from the kids. Great location for restaurants and things to do. Some of the fixtures in the room were in need of replacing (hook in the bathroom, tub faucet) but nothing that would make our stay less enjoyable. Very quiet despite loud location, comfortable, clean, and nice and friendly staff.", 
    "The room was perfect for our New Years stay in Chicago. Fitness area and pool were great. We would definitely stay here again. Only downside was the $65 per day parking fee.", 
    "The experience was great. We were there with our extended family which included 2 adults and 2 children. The children loved the pool. They love to swim. The location of the hotel was excellent for us to walk on Michigan Avenue to the Watertower and several restaurants. All employees were friendly and were very helpful.", 
    "We stayed in an updated room. The rooms are not spacious but fine for a family of 4 staying one night. Beds were very comfortable. There was usually a line for the elevator but it was a very busy time over holiday break. Pool was great for the kids. Loved the location of hotel.", 
    "Simply stated, the hotel is unable to host the amount of rooms available. There were times where we literally waited for elevators between 10-20 minutes, because they were so slow or due to over crowding. also, for some unknown reason, we were charged to use their fitness area? How the hell is that possible as it is already a sunk cost??", 
    "I came, I stayed. The guy who checked us in was nice (Elijah?). Other than that, the hotel staff pretty much was not seen or present.", 
    "At check in, the first room smelled damp, so when requesting another room it was not ready till 9:00 that night. I would say the location was great. In this hotel be aware that you have to pay to workout.", 
    "Great location, very nice hotel. We'd stay again. ", 
    "Bathroom amenities at a minimal. They could offer a cotton ball or q tip. Asked for extra robes. Waited 20 min called again housekeeping said never got call too another 10 minutes", 
    "Everything was great. We went for NYE! It's located near all of my favorite shoppes and restaurants. I hated that the room didn't have a fridge or a microwave, other than that I'd stay here again.", 
    "Very clean room and helpful staff. Convenient location right on the Magnifcent Mile. ", 
    "The elevators took forever, front desk staff rude, valet slow, overall rundown and appeared worn, elevators confusing being unable to get some floors from certain elevators due to renovations at hotel with poor signage and no way finding instructions given. Great location on Michigan ave but that was it.", 
    "All great", 
    "The hotel is in a great location. You walk out and your on Michigan Avenue. We were lucky enough to get a view of Michigan Avenue from our hotel room. The only compliant about the room that I have is that the bathroom did not have an exhaust fan. It was extremely hot to the point where we turned of the heat in the room becuase we were sweating while we were getting ready. The pool is nice water is heated and is very clean. The only other problem was the check in/check out, the line was extremely long and there were only two attendants working to assist customers. All in all the hotel was very clean and would stay here again.", 
    "Was very surprised at the size of the room. It was very spacious and an overall great experience!", 
    "Perfect location for Magnificent Mile. Great price for the luxury. Only negative was poor wifi quality.", 
    "This was a one night getaway for our 30th wedding anniversary and this hotel was perfect. The room was very clean and comfortable. The location on Michigan Avenue is excellent. Service was prompt and friendly. The room was very clean and well appointed. It was fairly small but plenty of room for two. The bathroom was very clean and updated. Good partial view of Lake Michigan from the 31st floor. The room was very quiet even though it was right next to the elevator. There were only 7 guest rooms on our floor so there wasn't much traffic. We paid extra so breakfast was included. It was excellent. Food was delicious with a good variety and impeccable service from the staff. We highly recommend this hotel.", 
    "Very busy at check in and out. Staff seemed a tad overwhelmed and construction was going on in the building which could have factored into things. Thought the pool could have stayed open a bit longer thatn 10. ", 
    " Find him a comfortable bed and a quiet room and smelled wonderful and his breakfast is excellent and wonderful price to book from expedia and deserves five stars .", 
    "Good hotel.... Great location On Michigan Ave ..... Makes sure you eat at geno's pizza .... Read details mini bar if item is move you are charged ..... Parking is $65 but great service and car out of the weather. . Resonabe nightly hotel rates.", 
    "The staff never asked us if we needed anything. I'm talking about 6 rooms and 21 people.", 
    "Great location - close to shopping on magnificent mile, ice skating at millennium park and not to far from a couple of L stops of you want to venture out to other Chicago neighborhoods. Bed was very comfortable!", 
    "$65 parking, remember .", 
    "My daughter and I really enjoyed the history behind this hotel. There is a free recorded walking tour you can take to learn about the history. There has been lots of great restoration done to this hotel.", 
    "It was bit on the small side but perfect for our needs. We were pleasantly surprised that the breakfast that was included was one of the best we ever had. The bed was very comfortable and the pool was amazing with full of historical beauty and elegance.", 
    "Terrible hotel and staff is rude! They charge more for less!! The concierge service is awfull and disristpectfull will never use intercontinental in chicago agai", 
    "It was my 25th wedding anniversary and we had to wait 1 1/2 hrs for our luggage I finally went down and got it myself. There was a line at the elevators all the time even though there was 4 of them. I have stayed on Michigan Ave at least 12 times on different hotels and I won't go back to this one. Just wish I didn't have to figure that out on my anniversary.", 
    "Got super faded and met zeds dead. Hotel wasn't bad coulda been bigger", 
    "Excelente", 
    "Excellent location, great hotel. Check-in team leaves allot to be desired. It took us 4 hours to get a room, and took 3 attempts. Each time we were told to simply wait, and a bellman would get our bags and move us to a new room. No one showed. I've stayed here sevenl times, but this was the worst. We feel one of our three days was wasted.", 
    "The lobby is unimpressive. Room was well-equipped. Location great.", 
    "You can't beat the location for downtown. The hotel is old but has charm and was well maintained. ", 
    "this is a great location for shopping, the parks and many dinner options. great combination of an older formal setting with updated beds and bathrooms and a very friendly staff. the pool is awesome!", 
    "We have just returned from a 5 night stay. Location is amazing, perfect for shopping, close to great restaurants. Hotel was clean, rooms were a little small for 4 of us, but no big deal. Food in bar was great, waiting staff were attentive and friendly. Bar staff not so friendly, especially one gentlemen. Shame! Reception staff great, friendly and helpful. Thank you for an amazing stay. We have made some fantastic memories. ", 
    "We stayed here for New Years. Great location and luxury at an affordable price. My only negative is that this place is busy! We needed to wait in line for the elevators, service, and coffee shop.", 
    "I had my 8 y/o grandson with me and everyone made sure he had a good time! Very helpful! I stayed there with my son 20 years ago and also for a conference. Always a great experience!", 
    "Wonderful location, hotel staff was absolutely amazing and helpful. Would stay again for sure ", 
    " Check-in was quick. Receptionist explained services offered and room was ready early which allowed us to relax for a few minutes before sightseeing. Room was very clean, comfortable and quiet.", 
    "Loved it.Very nice experience.I would love to come back.", 
    "Was great", 
    "Very nice in many ways, but especially appreciated the friendly and smiling staff!",

    "The room got warm so we put the air conditioning on but it was loud and never shut off. Staff very helpful.", 
    "Shower had mold. Elevators took excessive time to get and move in. Charged me for checkout. Terrible time . Was here 2 years ago and it has taken 10 steps backward ", 
    "Got a room on expedia for $103 after-tax for a Monday night before Christmas. Great overnight vacation while back in the Chicago suburbs.", 
    "When you get a good price on this, grab it. Spacious suite, huge buffet breakfast pool jacuzzi, very clean, and for a family of four...great deal ", 
    "It was exactly what I had hoped for, the comfort of home. Everyone I dealt with were personal, friendly, and helpful. I would recommend this hotel to anyone who inquires. I look forward to visiting Intercontinental Chicago, my son lives in Chicago and I will be back. Thank you for a wonderful experience. ", 
    "Long lines at check in. Staff was not friend or helpful", 
    "Fantastic location. Front desk helpful. Great pool to swim in, we enjoyed it.", 
    "Night downtown with the kids to enjoy the pool and see the lights. Service was friendly and very responsive. Super comfy bed!", 
    "I requested a handicap assessible bathroom at the time of booking the room. There were hand rails near the bath tub but the toilet was too low and made it difficult for us to use. The room itself was nice but smaller than it appeared in the pictures seen on line.", 
    "great location for shops in Michigan and restaurants. Park the car and walk everywhere from here. ", 
    "The location is great. Hotel room with double beds was not ready even an hour after checkin time. There was a wedding there and the music on our floor felt like we were at wedding - music finally stopped at around 11 pm. We were on the 9th floor. The indoor pool was warm and filled with lots of kids. They was someone on staff but the pool area was left messy with no housekeeping cleaning the area neat. ", 
    "We arrived around 4:00PM and the the valet outside was quick and took our car right away. The check-in process was long and arduous. The line of people that was out the door, and six or seven reservation agents were either busy with their head buried in the computer or vying with the manager to go on break. While waiting in-line, I went to find an ATM which required the assistance of three different people to find. Tough to tip your bell boys if you can't find an ATM. Eventually we were checked-in and then headed up to the room that we had reserved. We got a great rate through hotels.com - but overall the stay was poor. We ordered room service for dinner whose food quality was just beyond passable, yet unacceptable at a price of $59 for spaghetti and water!) The next morning we ordered pancakes and a belgain waffle which was so poor that we returned the pancakes. On check-out we were hit with unexpected charges. The room-service group said that they were going to remove the charge for the pancakes, but they did not, and then I saw a charge on my account for $65 for the overnight parking! All-in-all, a pretty disappointing experience at the Intercontinental. If I had paid full price for this room, I would have lost it.", 
    "Called ahead for early check-in, gave arrival time and they confirmed. Upon arrival, we waited in line 30 people deep, 20 minutes, to check-in. Room wasn't ready. We were advised via text that a room was ready twenty minutes after hotel check-in time. Stood in another line for 15 mins. Realized as I left desk that I had received only two room keys instead of the four keys I had just requested. Concierge wouldn't help me. I stood in line again for 15 minutes. No acknowledgement of error from desk clerk, or sincere apology for inconvenience. Room for four was narrow and small. Three bath towels, no wash clothes and no hand towels. Called for housekeeping to bring ASAP. However, 45 mins later, made a second call requesting the same, and 15 mins later towels arrived. Brunch was wonderful, although billing was incorrect and had to fix that. Bellmen was great, wait staff/hostess at brunch was great. But....Management was no where to be seen with the above errors, long lines, chaos. I couldn't recommend this hotel because the hassle-factors were too high.", 
    "Excellent location for shopping and sight seeing. Excellent and knowledgeable staff. The only complaint would be the wait for elevators, however this was occasional and could be excused since it only became an issue during the 2days prior to Christmas eve (high occupancy) Would choose again", 
    "Service was abysmal, updated rooms were small and construction quality was poor. Older rooms were comfortable but in need of an update and the windows were filthy, blocking our somewhat decent view of downtown Chicago.", 
    "We had a 2-hour delay getting into our room at 5:30 pm check-in. We didn't get into our room until 7:30 pm. We had to wait in line again for 30 minutes just to get our keys at 7:30 pm.", 
    "Room had a view of the alley. It took the front desk a long time to check us in. A bit overpriced.", 
    "STAY WAS OK. Room was not ready at check in time and there were many guests waiting for a room and had to wait to check in. This was difficult for those of us with reservations for dinner! ", 
    "Great staff, very accomodating.. Great location..", 
    "Good stay!", 
    "We wanted to visit the Christmas Market, Millennium Park, Eataly, and Water Tower Place. All within walking distance.", 
    "Very interesting historic hotel with great reconstruction to detail.", 
    "Excellent hotel. Had a very romantic stay with the gf here. Awesome pool, friendly staff, accommodating valet service, and a great location for doing downtown Chicago.", 
    "InterContinental Chicago Magnificent Mile.. Michael Jordon restaurant was very nice too. food was fantastic... Late check out..", 
    "We stayed here during the holidays and chose this hotel mostly because of the great rate we got. We were able to get 3 rooms, enabling us to spread out and be comfortable. Great location, comfortable rooms and beds, clean with good service.", 
    "We enjoyed the Intercontinental very much. Every year we spend the weekend before Christmas in Chicago, and every year we choose a different downtown hotel. We've always been lucky & this year is no exception: great price, great service, great atmosphere, great location! Thank you Intercontinental for a wonderful stay! PS - the old pool is amazing! ", 
    "Visited Chicago to look at wedding dresses with our daughter. Hotel location was perfect, Michigan Avenue a block from the Tribune building. Stayed in the historic tower which was charming. Fitness center with 1930's pool was very nice. Very comfortable, would stay again without reservation. Only shocker was the $65 a night parking. Management was very responsive to the one little problem we had getting a bag to the room from the valet.", 
    "Stayed at the Intercontinental for one night during Christmas week. Would give it 3.5/5. Location was great, staff extremely polite. Room was adequate, though could use a little work. Wallpaper was peeling off at the seams. Tube-shaped pillows not the most comfortable. Was very warm, had to blow cold air most of the night (Chicago in December?) to balance room temp. For one night in the city though it was a decent stay for the money. Starbucks entrance from lobby was a big plus in the morning. One note, I pre-booked overnight parking down the street from an online site and saved $37. The hotel valet is $67, pretty steep...", 
    "We had a great family get away for the weekend at Christmas time. The location couldn't be more perfect, right in the middle of Michigan Avenue attractions/shopping. We used the pool and room service for late night chocolate chip cookies in bed, a huge hit with our 3 and 5 year olds! The check in desk staff couldn't have been more efficient or accommodating during a very busy holiday weekend. Overall a great weekend getaway!", 
    "Great location but small rooms and housekeeping staff weren't welcoming. The checkin staff were very personable and friendly! Gorgeous pool but a little hard to get into for small kids and the elderly!", 
    "Keys to the room had be remade 3 times. Lack of elevator capacity and also often long lines in the reception area. Rooms ok, but not great.", 
    "Check in was delayed 2 hours. Room was mediocre. You can find better for similar price in area. Over 20 min wait for bell stand and valet pickup. Don't stay here", 
    "Very spacious room,very clean. Busy location but very helpful staff", 
    "Great room and lobby. I upgraded to a room with a view of Michigan Ave which didn't happen. Nonetheless, it was a great price.", 
    "they did not have two doubles as requested given a queen with a roll away very tight could not get in bathroom. gave us 1 morning of breakfast but did not makeup for room.", 
    "Not so friendly staff, but good location.", 
    "The hotel was wonderful and the room was great. Very happy with my stay and would highly recommend", 
    "The swimming pool and entrance to the hotel is elegant.", 
    "As other reviewers have noted, room is rather small. Staff friendly and efficient. The incidental charges are outrageous. My cellphone temporarily had a problem and I used the hotel phone for a long distance call to Miami of no more than 5 minutes. Was charged $30.00 for the call. Charges for wifi start at $15.00/day. Although I did not have a car, the posted rate for parking was $65.00/day.", 
    "Great location on Michigan Ave, service was impeccable, amenities were great. Only complaints are no lower-priced eating options in hotel (even in the bar) and no microwave in room.", 
    "We were supposed to have two beds but when we checked in they said they only has king size bed - and one rol away. Luckly - we were able to secure a second roll away = but it a rely fit in the room. Hotel was in a good location - but if you are used to staying in 4 or 5 star hotels you might be disappointed.", 
    "Excellent location and great hotel", 
    "Wew arrived in the early morning hours, 4 AM, and were still greeted with a wide awake and gracious clerk at check in. She was very helpful, and efficient considering the hour. She probably recognized the \"traveler fatigue\", and proceeded accordingly. We are planning another trip to Chicago in the spring, and will most likely stay at the Intercontinental. Everyone we encountered from the front desk clereks, concierge, bell captain, housekeeping, and valet was gracious, and made our stay there a wonderful experience.", 
    "I was disappointed that neither of the rooms I requested were ready at check-in. I was there at 4pm and a long line was formed to do the same. Your staff worked quickly to help everyone. I did accept a change of bedding for one room (2 doubles to a king with roll-a-way). My deluxe suite would not be ready for an hour or so. As we had reservations for dinner at 6:15 p.m. I was inconvenienced to use a friend's room to clean up. I realize that the hotel was busy due to the holiday season but I had thought I would be able to get into my room to freshen up before my dinner plans. Jeryl Lundberg", 
    "Rooms are very small compared to other hotels.", 
    "Parking was a problem for us after traveling 600+ miles. Did not know where the nearest parking area was", 
    "We have stayed at the Intercontinental before yet we were on the nice side. There are 2 towers and one is much, much nicer than the other. This stay we had a very cramped room that was no better than a 2 1/2 star hotel. Our shower curtain was ripped and hanging off, the bathroom was subpar. Overall, the room was way below expectations for a \"4 star\" hotel. The location is great...close to everything. Staff was very friendly as well. If booking, request the updated tower! Kind of disappointed....", 
    "the IH treated us like second class citizens because we booked on Hotels.com. We were stuck in the north tower which has very tiny rooms, even smaller than the surrounding boutique hotels. We won't be returning. Hotels.com should explain the room you are selecting at the time of your reservation. The Superior Room equals the north tower and means you will get a cramped room. The IH manager couldn't confirm that they offer any of their larger rooms on Hotels.com. Buyer beware!", 
    "It was great location and hotel. Would def go back", 
    "The hotel and staff were kind and courteous. Valet parking was prompt and very convenient.", 
    "It was a very nice stay in a beautiful hotel at a great location on Mich. Ave. We've stayed there before and will do so again.", 
    "This stay was a gift I gave my daughter. it was a romantic get away. They loved it and raved about it. They asked to have their room changed to the old historic section of the hotel which had more charm and character. It was like going back in time , but with all the modern conveniences and perks. The location in Chicago was perfect. They can't wait to stay there again.", 
    "The first room that we were given had a door connecting it to the room next door. It quickly became apparent that there was not much insulation between the rooms as we could hear the conversation of our neighbors. I found this surprising for such a nice hotel. However, after asking the front desk, they gave us a new room without a connecting door.", 
    "Awesome location. Very comfortable bed. Nice pool. Helpful staff. Bus system easily accessed.", 
    "Great hotel experience. By going mid-week, the cost was extremely reasonable.", 
    "This is a beautiful hotel. No doubt. I know my room was discounted and in hide sight I should have said something at the time. But I have thought about it and I need to speak up. Room 469 should not be used for occupancy. It was SO loud due to some mechanical system that sits directly outside the window. I literally could not sleep. I am a very experienced traveler with tons of international experience so I feel I am qualified to compare. This very attractive rate will interest the likes of tourists and young families. I promise they will have a bad experience/memories if they are given this room to sleep. This is the first time I have ever responded to any review request with anything but a positive comment. But I wish management would consider making Room 469 a utility closet. Thanks.", 
    "Parking is expensive and everything is an extra charge. But nice. ", 
    "The hotel was nice in the lobby and room. The lobby Christmas decorations was beautiful.", 
    "They didn't have our reservation when we arrived so the check-in was quite delayed. Apparently the communication between Hotels.com and the Hotel Intercontinental had a breakdown. I left my phone in the car with the confirmation email. When I went to get my phone from the car to supply the confirmation number, the retrieval was delayed because the Valet had an accident with my wife's brand new BMW. The overall stay was nice but I think I'll be parking my own vehicle unless I have rental cars. Off to the Body Shop.", 
    "The room was nice and clean and the people were friendly. The hallways and elevator lobbies were a little run down and not very clean. There was a half eaten slice of pizza on the floor in the elevator lobby and someones dinner dishes sat in the hallway for hours.", 
    "Great location. Nearby parking is expensive. Hotel shows some signs of age but is generally well kept. Pillows on the bed were too thick and gave me a sore neck.", 
    "Great stay, as always! Can't beat the location for shopping convenience. A fun place to stay as there is lots of activity and the close proximity to stores and restaurants is perfect!", 
    "Friendly staff, everyone was attentive, room was great. Only had one small issue. I placed my order for breakfast room service on the door knob at least an hour before the deadline and found it still hanging on my door in the morning when I looked down the hall to see if my food was coming yet after it was an hour late. It was minor compared to the great service otherwise.", 
    "Beautiful hotel with traditional hospitality and comfortable contemporary rooms. Amenities fantastic, even a small area in the mini frig for personal items. Well appointed and well thought out.", 
    "I went to a concert, that was great. Great location", 
    "On an overnight stay with friends, we enjoyed viewing the Christmas decorations, seeing a play, and relishing the excellent food experiences that Chicago has to offer. The hotel location is outstanding and convenient. Our room was quite large, most comfortable, and quiet. We needed non-down bedding because of allergies, and we were delighted with the bedding and the firmness of the mattresses. The bathroom was also large, with both a tub and a stand-up shower.", 
    "Short stay with my son, bit of Xmas shopping, sightseeing etc", 
    "Over rated I got the feeling that the lobby was in a mall food court.", 
    "They overbooked the first night and had to move us to trump towers. Not complaining about that. Staff at the intercontinental was great. ", 
    "Great location, would easily recommand a friend. Easy access to everything. Cleanliness. Friendly. And good value", 
    "Overall very nice. Wish they had a moderately priced resturaunt on site. Also the goodies in the room should be under lock and key with a better way of keeping track...we were charged for OJ and never touched any of them.", 
    "Received double beds wanted queen had to use my cell phone phone didn't work was left on hold for 40 minutes would not let my wife up to room after 1 she called me on cell to get dress and come down to lobby ", 
    "The location is perfect for downtown shopping and fun. One issue was they wanted to charge extra for both wifi and the workout facilities.", 
    "Staff very helpful...room very small but nice Had a beautiful view of all the air conditioners on a roof Since it was only one night and I grew up in the city it was fine", 
    "The service was very good but the rooms were very small. The photos make them look a lot bigger. I actually called the reception when we got to our room because it was so small and I thought it would be bigger based on the photos at hotels.com The room I booked was the superior king. Maybe the deluxe rooms are bigger?", 
    "Great location, close to shopping and restaurants. The basic rooms are very tiny not great for more than two guests. Staff very courteous and friendly. ", 
    "Expensive and inconvenient parking. Out dated room condition. Not so bad, but not so good.", 
    "Fantastic location for our pre-holiday getaway!", 
    "perfekter, schneller + unkomplizierter Service! ", 
    "The hotel staff was well-trained, friendly, and very helpful. Thisi is our 6th visit and certainly will not be our last. These comments apply to the entire staff. ", 
    "I was very displeased when upon check-in, I was informed the room I had reserved (two people, two beds) was not available. I was told since I had booked through a third party, they weren't required to honor my confirmation. I ended up with one king size bed, which was not at all what I wanted. I was told I could have a roll away bed brought to the room. Again, not at all what I wanted. The next morning, I really wanted food... the area that had once been a very nice dining area, is now a Starbucks. (not at all what I wanted for breakfast)", 
    "My wife and I were looking for a place to stay the Wednesday night before Thanksgiving in order to be close enough to walk to State Street for the parade. The Intercontinental was the perfect location. A 15 minute walk down Michigan Avenue to Randolph then to State Street and we had a great view of the parade. The hotel is very comfortable and clean. We had drinks and appetizers at Michael Jordan's restaurant bar in the lobby, the bar tenders provided superior service and the restaurant menu is available at the bar, a good option if the restaurant wait is excessive.", 
    "Great hotel, perfect location, staff friendly and helpful. Room clean and well appointed. Breakfast was included in our stay, excellent in quality and presentation.", 
    "Perfect location...We'll be back!", 
    "Found hair on the pillow. Bathroom was not clean. Towels's color were gray and not soft probably the color was white ", 
    "When I checked in they only had one person working the checking in desk although they had room for 10, there was only one person in front of me checking out and they had a dispute with their bill so it took over 10 minutes before I was helped. The rooms are extremely small. The pool area is not clean, there was water all over the floor which made for a hazardous experience at the pool.", 
    "Great hotel, in a great location. Rooms a little on the small side, but clean and comfortable.", 
    "The hotel is a bit worn out and in need of a refresh. Faded carpets; small threadbare towels you expect to find in a two-star hotel; and a saggy old arm-chair in the deluxe room. The shower/bath combo was also two-star stuff, complete with erratic caulking. At least the shower curtain didn't stick to me. Bed was comfortable and the location and view was fantastic.", 
    "Room was very small..felt a lilittle claustrophobic..", 
    " My airplane delayed and I arrived at Intercontinental hotel 2am in the morning. I was tired. The Intercontinental hotel manager was especially kind and gave me a really very nice big room at high floor. The room is more like a junior suite with nice sitting area , sofa and desk. The bath room is all marble with both tub and glass shower. All elegant and well designed. the towel was fluffy. The bed was fantastic. I slept soundly after a day of hassle in traveling. The hotel manager also give me a complimentary coupon of Starbucks fresh brewed coffee. Next morning , I picked up a nice cup of hot coffee, walk out of Hotel , it is right on Chicago's Magnificent Mile. I Walk to AON center up to the 80th floor, Mid American Club for breakfast and enjoyed the wonderful view of Lake Michigan and awesome city skyline.I walk back in pleasant sunshine on Michigan ave which was lined with beautiful shops. I stayed at the same Intercontinental during 2013 Christmas holiday with my daughter. I reserved a suite. I was pleasantly surprised, the hotel gave us the 2 bed room suite occupied the hotel's entire top floor with living room and private elevator. We enjoyed the precious Christmas accompanied by the lights of city of Chicago. We went to a beautiful opera not too far from hotel. The Chicago opera house is elegant, cozy and very nice. We had a memorable vacation. Great hotel, Nice staff.", 
    "nice and clean, lots of space in room", 
    "Always want to stay here. Convenient and lots of good restaurants within walking distance", 
    "Weekend getaway with the family. Have stayed here before always clean rooms, great service. Never had any problems. this time stayed in the 'Newer' side of the hotel, still very nice however the rooms are a bit smaller and therefore more crowded, also the carpet in the halls is amongst the ugliest carpets I have ever seen. Still a great place to stay, and we'll likely stay here again for our family getaways to downtown. BEST SWIMMING POOL IN THE CITY.", 
    "We liked hotel in general. Pretty from outside and comfy inside (beds were wonderful). Staff was slightly rude and unhelpful. Otherwise good value for money spent. ", 
    "nice hotel, very friendly staff, but the room was tiny!", 
    "Staff was friendly and courteous. Location was great! So close to all the good shops and restaurants. Parking was a breeze!", 
    "The location is perfect right on Michigan avenue and walking distance everywhere nearby Rush street and Magnificent Mile. Intercontinental name with cheap hotel quality. Rooms are fine, bathroom needs some update. They are selling location and the Intercontinental name, but inn quality of accommodation.", 
    "Great location, great hotel and excellent staff. Everyone was very knowledgeable and quick to fix any issues we had. The concierges in particular were phenomenal at recommending things to do and companies to do them with. I would definitely stay here again!", 
    "My first impression was from the bellman....he was gracious, smiling, informative. Next the lady at the front desk was very friendly. The room was perfect. The soaps and shampoos were top of the line. But....the best part.....was the pool. It was magnificent."

I have been using for several years now. I go to Europe at least twice a year and do not have a problem. Do not put a blame on me when Conrad have incompetent personnel.", 
    "Room was very comfortable - lots of lobby room to relax in.", 
    "The check in staff were awesome. Upon check in they gave an updated weather forecast that instantly took care of the fear I had of spending a rainy day in Chicago. The cleaning staff provided me with extra bottles of water which is always a plus. The bathroom did leave me a little uncomfortable as their was hair in the shower faucet and a strand of hair on top of the comforter. The room size was great. The view was great. The staff was great.", 
    "We planed to look around navy pier and millenium park, and to cruise in Chicago River. We parked our car at public parking lot with a reasonable price, which was just across this hotel. We took a taxi to move to the Loop one time because of rain, but would never do that if the weather was fine. The location of this hotel is so convenient that walking is just enough to look around the center of Chicago. The room was average but clean, and complimentary apples and sample breads for breakfast was also helpful for us. Thanks to this hotel, our trip was more enjoyable!",

Overall I was delighted with this hotel, will stay here again next time I'm in Chicago.", 
    "Staff very helpful. Rooms clean and well appointed. Only small complaint, no buffet breakfast and dinner was very average", 
    "The location was ideal. Enjoyed rooms next door so the sisters could go between rooms easily. Cabbed to 900 N Michigan and shopped our way back to the hotel. Arrived early afternoon. And rooms were ready. There is an enclosed walkway to a shopping mall. So many great restaurants within one block of the hotel. Joe's Stone Crab is must visit. If you are a foodie, then another must visit is Eataly around the corner for imported food items, including chocolates, and many dining options upstairs. Nice, large bathroom with separate water closet. Would definitely stay at the Conrad in the future.",

This past weekend was our first visit to The Conrad Hotel...and we loved it! The location was great, the staff was friendly and accommodating, the lobby, room, elevators, and room were all very clean, and the amenities comfortable. We have been coming to the city for about five years, and The Conrad is now in a tie with our favorite hotel downtown! ", 
    "The Conrad Chicago is a beautiful hotel & has everything you would expect from a 4 star hotel. When we stayed, it was the most affordable hotel in its category and despite being cheapest, quality was not sacrificed at all. This is a great hotel and a great value! Location can't be beat - it's perfect. ",

    "Easy to get to without fighting a lot of traffic. Perfect location for shopping and bar hopping", 
    "The Conrad Hotel has a good service, the people was very kind, the hotel was very near from everything and the food was really nice. ", 
    "Staff was very welcoming and professional. The room was spacious, clean, and very comfortable.", 
    "Great hotel with great staff, food and cleanliness!", 
    "Met my daughter & granddaughter for the weekend hotel, staff, amenities and location were fantastic!", 
    "Fantastic hotel in a great location - close to everything on Michigan Avenue and attached to a shopping mall. My daughter and I met in Chicago to celebrate our birthdays, and when we told the gentleman who was checking us in, he upgraded us to an executive suite immediately! It was HUGE with a gigantic rooms (living, bedroom, & bathroom). The bed was absolutely wonderful and the city view was amazing. I would DEFINITELY stay here again!!", 
    "Your staff are very helpful and courteous. I loved the location, cleanliness, and layout of our room. Our family plans on making Conrad our choice each time we visit Chicago. The doormen were very helpful, while being professional.", 
    "The room service response time was horrible. There were three phones in my room and only one worked which was in the bathrroom. I booked the room for a double bed. I received a one bed. The hotel didn't have any other rooms. Not even a suite. I was very displeased and will not stay at the Conrad chicago ever again. I need to be compensated for not meeting my specifications. Thanks", 
    "Had a good night! King deluxe room . The rooms are spacious, bathroom is nice, good location(connected to mall that leads to magnificent mile), and staff is great!", 
    "Exceptionally nice hotel. Given a choice, I would avoid the roll in shower, but this amenity was probably factored into the reasonable price.", 
    "Very convenient location, near shopping mall and public transportation. Great service, clean room, good view ", 
    "Parking was an ease. If you're like me and can't afford valet then this hotel is great. Self parking is literally right across from the hotel so you don't have to go far. Plus the street wasn't too busy when I was there so I wasn't waiting forever to turn into the parking ramp. Room was great nice and spacious. overall experience with this hotel was amazing", 
    "The Conrad is a very nice hotel for the price. It's really nice hotel, period, but given I was able to book this for such a reasonable rate and be right downtown is amazing. The rooms are clean, the beds are thick, the hotel has a good vibe to it and there are plenty of staff there to take care of your needs.", 
    "The staff was friendly and inviting. The hotel was immaculate. It's costs more then the typical traveler may care to spend. But if you want to treat yourself, or your family to a stay that may rival tourist attractions, then this is the establishment for you.", 
    "Great location. Luxurious room. Great staff. What more could you want", 
    "My daughter and I went to Chicago for a long weekend vacation. Our stay at the Conrad Chicago was excellent from the moment we were greeted by Mauricio. The room was beautiful and the staff friendly and welcoming. Every recommendation they made for dining was excellent. The bartender (sorry I cannot remember his name) was exceptionally friendly and nice. Our overall experience exceeded our expectations!", 
    "The stay was excellent. The staff was extremely helpful and made our stay memorable.", 
    "My flight was cancelled and I had to book a hotel quickly--The Conrad was beautiful, the staff was super friendly and it is attached to Nordstrom and a mall so it was easy to get a few things I needed Will stay on my next trip to Chicago", 
    "As someone who is extremely nit picky when it comes to selecting hotels I would say it was a great experience. Great location easy access to the food court at the mall, so your not stuck eating the resteraunts food etc. Best pillow selection ever! Lol just book it.", 
    "The hotel was close to everything downtown. Great experience....", 
    "Walk everywhere in a reasonable amount of time with a variety of food for every palate. ", 
    "Great location. Room was well appointed and quiet.", 
    "A block from Michigan Ave and connected to a mall, this hotel is perfect for anyone who wants to shop in Chicago. The room was nice and clean, the only complaint is that the minifridge didn't work very well and all of their appliances were compatible with the old apple chargers (4/4s), but that's knit-picking. The workout room was AMAZING. Lots of treadmills/elipticals, free weights and even some machines and medicine balls. ", 
    "It was very sofisticated, comfort and relax stay in US. Conrad is located in Downtown's safe area, it is also very convinient to enjoy Jazz or Blues at night though I visited Chicao in business. It is highy recomended to book.", 
    "We try to stay at different hotels when we visit Chicago. But this one is going to be tough to beat. We did stay at the \" the tall shiny one on Wacker a few years ago and all I can say is the Conrad is right up in that category. ", 
    "I booked through Expedia with one rate, at checkout they had charged me a different (higher) rate. Thankfully I caught it and they resolved the issue quickly. The hotel is really pretty, has a boutique feel. The room was large, there was a shower stall and bath tub rather than a typical shower/tub combination. The beds were really comfortable and there were enough pillows for 4 other people to stay with me! It was perfect. I grabbed a yummy latte on my way out of town at the coffee shop in the lobby, passed on the yummy looking baked goods though. ", 
    "I had a wonderful night at this hotel, and I will be back again to the same hotel if planning to come again to Chicago.", 
    "Beautiful room and comfortable beds. Great location for shopping. My daughter and I had a wonderful time. The staff made it very easy to check in and out. Also told me I could park across the street in the parking garage instead of paying extra for the valet to park it in the same garage. They even put it on your hotel bill for you. We will definitely stay there again.", 
    "Very nice hotel, convenient location and will be returning!", 
    "Hotel was overbooked and had no rooms. They made arrangements at a nearby hotel and sent me off with a voucher and cover letter to cover the 1 night stay. I chose to walk even though it was frigid. The Conrad had no cabs waiting and the Bellman was absent. The staff was apologetic and very effective.", 
    "The Conrad is everything that one looks for in a fine hotel. Great staff. Superb location. Wonderful rooms. I would recommend to anyone. ", 
    "Great place to stay and super close to Mich Ave for shopping. Hotel bar a bit pricey. No other complaints!", 
    "We traveled to Chicago for a weekend get-away and stayed at the Conrad Chicago.", 
    "The staff was great, the presentation of the hotel was amazing and I couldn't get enough of the attached shopping center. I look forward to returning soon. ", 
    "We got a large corner room with deep soaker tub. We were also given two vouchers for breakfast. It was the perfect weekend trip. Nothing negative to say.", 
    "Great property, very comfortable. Excellent staff. Had a little trouble with a broken bathroom door. I reported in and didn't get any response but otherwise a great property!", 
    "This is Absolutely the Best Hotel I've ever Visited! If you are looking for the Best then you are looking for Conrad!", 
    "Beautiful stay...loved it & would like to come again & again.", 
    "Great experience - I have already recommended to friend", 
    "Great. Everything was top shelf", 
    "The location of the hotel couldn't have been more central in terms of the Chicago city. I was extremely appreciative of the staff's helpfulness and generosity throughout the duration of the stay.", 
    "The customer service was great. The rooms were clean and very comfortable. The food was good. One draw back - room service and the restuarant are highly over priced. I ordered two waffles, coffee and a juice and the bill was $60.00 with tip! Otherwise it really is a fantastic hotel.", 
    "The hotel did not have Comcast channel for the Hawks game. Everything else was great. Location was excellent.", 
    "I had a great experience!! The check-in/check-out service was really fast and easy", 
    "Rooms were great, and the beds were comfortable. Small hotel bar, but very nice.", 
    "Room 1528. Beds were terrible. Mattresses need to be replaced.", 
    "Shopping and dinner in 10 degrees weather and didn't need a coat ", 
    "The hotel was beautiful. Found a GREAT rate thru hotels.com. The woman who checked us in was rude but all other staff was amazing and pleasant. I just wasn't expecting the $100+ fee for incidentals/per night. I think that's excessive. Most hotels have a flat rate that doesn't exceed $100....I just I should've inquired. Otherwise everything was great! I love Chicago. Many tourist attractions were in walking distance. I will be back in Chicago for vacation ASAP and if the price is right, I'll stay at the Conrad P.S. I really like that they provided qtips and cotton balls in the bathrooms! lol", 
    "It is a great hotel, overall the staff was very service oriented, helped a lot on recomendations on the area attractions and restaurants, except for the bar tender that was rude to us and in a bad mood all time we spent at the bar, and we received the same comments from a couple that were sitting next to us. Room is very nice and comfortable with a great bathroom. Bose system in-room was a great feature!!! WiFi included throughout the hotel and room.", 
    "Well located close to shopping. Self parking is across the street. Large, nicely finished room. Comfortable bed. Overall an above average overnigHt experience.", 
    "Good location, close to stores, a mall on the first 4 floors. Nice clean rooms. Good environment. ", 
    "Awesome hotel and staff. Everything about is perfect!!!", 
    "The hotel is in good shape in general and well located. Although the restaurant is weak in terms of service quality and variety of choices, the overall service quality of the hotel is very good. It has 2 entrances, one for cars and one for the pedestrians (via a small shopping mall), which makes it convenient as the weather in Chicago is not welcoming in winter. The shops, cafes, restaurants and other points of interest makes it perfect for staying. As a usual Conrad guest, I would recommend it highly.", 
    "Great hotel close to tons of restaurants, eately, and the parks. ", 
    "Great location, lounge, room, etc.", 
    "I stayed there for two nights. Everything was fine except the WIFI. I needed the help of a call center clerk in order to access the WIFI. It took almost one our. ", 
    "Caught a deal on expedia and had wanted to try this hotel for some time but it's usually price prohibitive (on weekends). Booked king room. Check-in was super quick and hotel staff? Amazing and helpful. Room was nice size, no view, but we didn't expect or need one. Bathroom was huge. Awesome huge. Loved it. Huge tub, nice separate shower. Room temp was adjustable and stayed comfortable. Bed was super comfy. Black out drapes-loved. Checkout was perfect. Can't wait to stay again. Oh and location could not be more perfect. ", 
    "convenient and very accommodation staff. I was notfeeling well and the staff took care of eeverything. ", 
    "Great price, awesome location! Our new go to hotel in chicago!", 
    "Enjoyed the room, nice huge bathroom and comfortable. Very convinent to have the stores and food court as well. Enjoyed the huge king size bed and definitely need to come back. ", 
    "This hotel was first class in every way. The rooms were large and immaculate.", 
    "We had a great stay at the Conrad - the staff was friendly and helpful (great Concierges) - and when we were stuck in Chicago for about 12 hours extra due to blizzard, they let us have a late checkout.", 
    "One of the best locations in Chicago. It's even connected to shopping that leads you onto Michigan AVE. They have a nice lobby bar and terrace. Service was top notch and felt well taken care of. The room was quite dated though... the bed, TV, stereo were new but everything else looked pretty old. A great stay though and would 100% recommend.", 
    "The location is vibrant in chicago with access to lots of fun things to see and do. The hotel is just beautiful. The lobby is sexy located on a floor above street level. I could gave gazed at the fireplace for hours. The rooms are larger than standard hotel rooms and just faboulous. Cannot wait to get back there. ", 
    "Fantastic hotel in a convenient location with friendly staff. Just perfect!", 
    "the hotel was lovely. all the staff was courteous, and concierge sent us to a lovely restaurant within walking distance of the hotel. fabulous! ", 
    "We've stayed at several MagMile hotels in the past year and this was the nicest by far. My only issue was that I was coming down for a medical procedure and staying 2 nights. I had requested that the room be cleaned while we were out for the procedure bc I would need to return to rest. Didn't happen. Waited over an hour in the lobby while they sent someone up. Finally gave up and went to rest bc I was exhausted. They gave us dessert vouchers for our troubles. Dessert vouchers? Really? That's exceptional service?", 
    "I will stay there every time I visit Chicago!! Centrally located. Attached to the Nordstrom Mall. One block off Magnificent Mile. ", 
    "Fabulous hotel and fantastic service from Hotels.com. We had to cut our 3-night stay early due to a threatening snow storm en route to Chicago and Hotels.com even refunded our 3rd night stay at 5 p.m. the same day. Will definitely return to The Conrad Chicago and book through Hotels.com again in the future.", 
    "Great location, wonderful service, super room", 
    "Stayed here for 3 nights, good location right on top of The Shops at North Bridge. Room was a corner room, small but good for 3 nights. You can walk in Michigan ave comfortably and near the Loop but if its snowing too much its better to take taxi to the Loop. Near restaurants: RPM Italian, Quartino, Grand Lux Cafe, Giordanos and at the Loop Wildberry Pancakes & Cafe.", 
    "Great location and good room. No spa and just ok workout center", 
    "Nicest hotel I've ever stayed at in Chicago to date. Definitely going back, very nice quality room and service. Easy, quick access to Michigan ave, restaurants, malls, clubs/bars. Only con I can think of is hotel restaurant is very expensive, eat/drink outside hotel. ", 
    "Centrally located in downtown Chicago. Connected to a mall. Around the corner from Eataly. You can walk everywhere. ", 
    "Very beautiful hotel, friendly service, excellent downtown location connected to shopping and very close to nice restaurants. We had a great stay, and would certainly stay again.", 
    "My experience was great. I had excellent service, not to mention a very nice, clean, and spacious room with wonderful amenities. ", 
    "Room was just what we needed. Restaurant service was slow for lunch, but all else was great!", 
    "very contemporary cool boutique hotel, close to everything including shopping and great chicago restaurants. also a short walk to the L to explore the city even more", 
    "Not anything opulent or really luxurious(which is what I thought it would be). However, very solid - good sized rooms and large bathrooms, very comfortable, nice lobby, friendly staff. ", 
    "Had a great time staying in this hotel. The room was great, the staff was great, and the food was as well. Wonderful place to stay. ", 
    "The room size was large compared to others we've stayed in while visiting downtown Chicago. The beds were very comfortable, but we would have preferred two queen sized beds instead of two doubles.", 
    "From the moment we walked in we were greeted warmly and checked in quickly. The room was beautiful with a large bathroom. The staff at the hotel bar was friendly and knowledgeable. And the free wifi at a hotel of this caliber was a bonus. We will definitely be back.", 
    "Hotel was dead smack in the middle of every place I love to visit while in Chicago. Not only that but was able to walk to them all which saved me lots of money when it came to parking.", 
    "Booked weeklong stay for business taking advantage of the offseason rates. This hotel compares favorably with the best hotels in Chicago. The location is exceptionally convenient for my Michigan Avenue office. Dozens of restaurants within a few blocks.", 
    "Just a few things, I have stayed at this hotel before and had a wonderful time on both occasions. However this time, I was not impressed with the stay. Staff not as friendly as before, amenities not appealing, and just a general blandness about the atmosphere (feels like no one enjoys their job). My trip was extended a day but when I called to extend a day - was told NO we don't have availability, no problem went to Expedia and started to look for another hotel, and low and behold there was a listing for rooms available at the Conrad. Went with another hotel, where I was treated so wonderfully, that they are my new hotel of Chicago. See ya Conrad", 
    "Rooms were spacious compared to other comparable hotels in area and location was great", 
    "Excellent location. A great deal.", 
    "Outstanding hotel and service.", 
    "Great location attached to Nordstroms. Loved the room and especially the spacious bathroom with separate toilet. Most comfortable beds and linens in any hotel that I have ever stayed in! Nice touch with water bottles in the room and 24 hour workout room. When inquired about ordering coffee to the room they sent up a tray with a keurig and plenty of coffees and cream all free of charge Will definitely stay there again!!", 
    "My wife's first trip to Chicago and the magnificent mile was a \"wow\" Outstanding customer service throughout from the doorman, valet, front desk and restaurant staff. Treated with the utmost respect and kindness. Elegant hotel. Affordable. Clean and quiet. Fantastic location just steps from the magnificent mile. We won't be staying anywhere else!! This is a must do if you want to have an AWSOME experience in downtown Chicago. My complements to the entire staff !!", 
    "Clean, well located and accommodating. I would prefer not to add any more at this time.", 
    "Excellent hotel. Great staff! You can't go wrong with this one. ", 
    "Last minute, we decided to take advantage of a nice January weekend and head into the city. We booked a room last minute and because it was a slower time during the year, were able to secure a wonderful room at the Conrad. We will definitely return.", 
    "This hotel has always served us well for a weekend getaway. The location is perfect and provides close access to dining and entertainment.", 
    "Great service. All staff were very friendly and helpful. Nice bathroom with separate shower and large tub. Location is great and connected to the Nordstrom mall on Michigan Avenue.", 
    "Everything was fantastic. It's hard to wrap my head around a $69 valet parking fee for one night. Room service was fast. Called to have them remove the cart and no one ever came. Needless to say I put it in the hallway. Breakfast was really good. Pillow menu was a nice touch. TV instructions could be easier to understand. However, it was cold and you can text the valet to bring your car around. By the time you're checked out your car is nice aND warm. I would stay here again especially if they lower the valet price.", 
    "Perfect stay, very good location, nice room, friendly staff", 
    "Fully enjoyed and relaxing even with the endless shoe shopping. If you get a chance eat at Joes across from the downstairs extended lobby as the staff there were very nice and the meals were nice.", 
    "It was a great stay The location is really good And staffs are kind The hotel is connected to the Nordstrom", 
    "Comfy bed and pillows accessible to stores and restaurants ", 
    "Awesome location, friendly staff, great hotel!!!", 
    "Very clean and impressibe accomodations. Cool 5th floor lobbt. Within walking distance to great restaurants.", 
    "When I checked in at the front desk, I was told, I had requested a accessible room, I told them that was incorrect, that I asked for a regular room with double beds. I said, but I booked a regular room, the gentleman said well that's not what we have down for you. He said, you booked it through Expedia, that I would have to take it up with Expedia. I told him I booked through Hotel.com. The gentleman said he had a regular room with double beds, I said I will take it, he said he would have to charge me an extra $.. The rooms were going for the same price, why the extra $10. Upon checking out, I was charged $ for parking, in which I did not drive to Chicago, a real nightmare for my Christmas getaway. While standing line, I heard other people complaining about their billing. I was refunded my $.. dollars but I will Never stay at the Conrad hotel again.", 
    "Great location, good staff and service.", 
    "Nice property in a good location. King suite was nicely equipped and decorated. It was clean. The staff were pleasant and tried to be helpful. The service however had numerous missteps. Arrived early with prior notification. Had to wait over 3 hours for a room on a Sunday. Stored baggage was to be delivered to room when ready. Luggage misplaced and not delivered for over 1/2 hour after arriving at room. No bedding in the room for pullout couch. Calling for bedding at 10:30pm when discovered yielded another 1/2 hour wait. Candy found in unmade pullout couch.", 
    "Great Hotel in the best area. You can go north or south a few blocks and get to anything.", 
    "Comfortable rooms. Great amenities and hotel service. Location is perfect for shopping.", 
    "We travel to chicago often and have stayed at several hotels. This location was excellent and the rooms were very spacious. The Conrad is at the top of our list. We will definitely return.", 
    "Peaceful", 
    "Really nice to go from your room to Nordstrom without going outside when it is freezing! And when you do go outside, its a quick walk across the street to many more stores and restaurants. ", 
    "The Conrad was perfect for my business trip. It was very clean and quiet, and in a great location, near restaurants and the train. At the time, there was construction on the hotel, so one of the elevators was out of use, but other than that the stay was very hassle-free.", 
    "Perfectly priced", 
    "Beautiful hotel, wonderful service. Have stayed in pricier hotels with higher acclaim, will never stay anywhere else in Chicago. Clean, beautiful, perfect location right off of Michigan Ave. A FANTASTIC hotel.", 
    "Very nice hotel. The conbstruction was a small problem, but overall wonderful stay. ", 
    "Great location! Access to everything. Rooms were fantastic!", 
    "Beautiful hotel in what is, in my opinion, one of the best locations in Chicago! Service is top notch, and the bed is extremely comfy. We downloaded the concierge app, and that was really helpful too!", 
    "This was our second time staying here, and looking for many more in the future. Staff was super friendly and the location was perfect for what we love to do while visiting.", 
    "Just an average Chicago hotel I was expecting much more since it was Conrad hotel", 
    "Great place, great location, great service", 
    " I found the Conrad very standard but the price was luxurious. I expected a higher standard for the expense. Greeting was poor, nobody assisted me with my bags and I felt like a second class customer. As an international guest, I used a travel money card and nobody explained that my line of credit would be tied up with a hold on the funds well past my complete settlement of the bill. If I'd known this I would have used a different type of card. I had no access to my funds for several days follwing check out because the room fee plus $100 per day was not cleared immediately. Conrad blamed the bank and the bank blamed Conrad.", 
    "Great Hotel for a family stay in Chicago. This review is of a King Junior Suite - cant comment on a standard hotel room but the suite was perfect. The Hotel is impeccably clean, the suites are very roomy and comfortable. Nice Fitness Center, great location. Really, the only downside considering this is a luxury hotel is the absence of a pool or hot tub.", 
    "I've traveled the world over and usually stay in four or five star hotels. I'm pretty demanding, but not unreasonably so. This hotel and staff exceeded my expectations in every area. I just can't say enough good things about the Conrad! High ups, guys. ", 
    "First time stay at a Conrad and in this location of CHI. Would definitely return. the only downfall was the lounge and the bar service. Very slow, non responsive to the arrival of customers and the staff on all 3 nights were obvioulsy very new or just not very good in the service industry.", 
    "Everything was good exempt I booked a handicap room on accident and the shower was a pain because water leaked everywhere. Other then that I love the location. Everything was very comfortable and the staff was very friendly. ", 
    "Excellent hotel, excellent location. Would definitely stay again. If i'm picking fault, the only thing I would change would be adding a bath to the bathroom (there is only shower).", 
    "Great location, nice price and lovely rooms, bathrooms might need a little updating but even then, the rooms were still great. Will stay there again next time we are in town. The location alone make it a must and such a great atmosphere inside the lobby.", 
    "Hotel was nice, room service was very poor. 3 of 6 meals had major issues. Rooms were comfortable. One of the ladies at the front desk was quite rude.", 
    "Could have used an extra towel", 
    "i have stayed at several hotels in the city over the last 12 years and this one is now my favorite, will definitely be coming back if I am able to get the great deal I received on Hotels.com. This hotel has everything and then some, and the area is perfect for all the city has to offer in entertainment, food and shopping.", 
    "My three daughters and I come every year for our annual Xmas shopping/bonding weekend. We wait all year for our time away. This is the second year we've stayed at the Conrad. Love, love love it. Very convenient to Michigan Ave. and everyone always wonderful. See you next year!", 
    "Great location. Attached to a mall which leads out to Michigan Ave so great shopping and nice restaurants are only minutes away. Wonderful breakfast menu. The only downside is the parking rate which was more than the daily rate for my rental car but this is typical for this Chicago neighborhood. And you really don't need a car because you can walk to everything.", 
    "Peanut butter stuffed French toast was awesome! Close to shopping.", 
    "Delivered what was promised. Staff was friendly. ", 
    "We decided to go downtown at the last minute. We got a great price and requested a room along with Michigan Avenue so we could view the light parade from our room. We go the room we requested and had a great view of the parade. The room was clean, modern and had everything stocked that you might need. The staff was friendly. I would book this hotel the next time we decide to take a weekend trip to the city", 
    "Amazing location. Had a great stay while celebrating our anniversary.", 
    "Great hotel overall. The bar and restaurant were a bit pricey. Nice room with comfy bed and the bathroom was plenty big.", 
    "The Conrad has always been a great choice of hotels for family trips to Chicago. The rooms and amenities have always exceeded my expectations. Also, the proximity to shopping on Michigan Avenue is excellent and the connection to North Bridge mall is good during cold weather. There are an abundance of restaurants and pubs in the area providing a great variety of food and entertainment options. Great location stay for the Magnificent Mile Light Festival.", 
    "Curbside check in was a breeze even with all the chaos of the Downtown Festival of Lights parade. Don't mistake The Conrad Hotel for The Marriott like several of us did this day bcuz they are adjacent to one another and their curbside seems awefully familiar. Other than that this Hotel rates a 10!", 
    "Hotel was clean, comfortable and quiet. I believe it was newly renovated. I would definitely stay here again.", 
    "Everything was great!", 
    "Great location, very helpful and informative staff. Would definitely recommend to others! ", 
    "Excelente", 
    "It was a great place to stay, and would recommend it to anyone for a getaway stay!!!", 
    "Very chic yet comfortable hotel conveniently located on Michigan Ave. Staff are very friendly & helpful. I've stayed in several hotels in Chicago but this is definitely my favourite.", 
    "We had a great experience at the Conrad. My husband and I went for a weekend trip and were very impressed with the staff and vibe at the hotel. The beds were comfortable and we were able to walk to tons if restaurants/bars.", 
    "Excellent location on Michigan Ave.; awesome service! Thanks", 
    "From start to finish, it was a lovely stay. Super friendly and helpful staff. Great amenities. Superb location.", 
    "The restaurant is small, but the food is good. Lobby is beautiful, concierge service was excellent and people from the front desk too. ", 
    "I love staying at Contads. Beautiful hotel, well-trained staff, nice amenities. I have ti say, though, these negatives were disappointing: the entrance through the mall takes too long, the tv in the room malfunctioned in an annoying way(horrible feedback when turningit on--until you change to a station; facilities guy said its true of all in hotel), lights in bathroom buzzed when on. I'd stay again but these weee drawbacks.", 
    "The only minor issue was the toilet handle being very loose and sometimes made it hard to flush the toilet. Other than that the room was very nice, the location was great and all service was outstanding. We really enjoyed our trip.", 
    "From check-in the check-out, this hotel offered excellent service and comfort. We had a large room on the 16th floor. The bathroom was especially well-finished with a sunken bathtub and separate toilet area. The bed was very comfortable, and housekeeping staff did a great job each day refreshing the room. The Conrad is in a central location in downtown Chicago. Concierge staff was helpful with recommendations. Thanks for the daily fresh, green apples! Nice details throughout.", 
    "Very central hotel. Our room was spacious and pleasant. Staff friendly and helpful.", 
    "Great stay.. If your looking for quality look no further.", 
    "Great stay. Convenient location. Highly recommend!", 
    "What a perfect location for shopping. Not impressed with the food choices in hotel but surrounded by plenty of other choices. Bartender could be a little more polite!", 
    "Hotel is in a great location downtown and attached to a mall. Water Tower place is just a short walk away. Very attentive staff and very nice rooms......but no coffee maker in the room. A Bose sound system on the TV, but no coffee maker.", 
    "All was amazing except for 2 minor issues: The room stayed a bit warm and the heating/air conditioning unit wasn't able to bring the room to desired temperature. The 2nd issue was the fact that the front desk staff answered and helped people who called in while there was a line of people waiting at the desk to be helped.", 
    "Fantastic deal on a terrific hotel made for a great weekend on the mile in Chicago. Ideal location.", 
    "My boyfriend and I stayed for one night for our anniversary. We had such a wonderful time, I wish we would have stayed longer. The hotel is modern, immaculately clean, beautifully decorated and just all-around excellent. The front desk staff was friendly and courteous, the restaurant and bar staff was polite and attentive, and the hotel had some terrific amenities. The hotel is located above a mall and right next to Michigan Ave. shopping. Perfect location! The hotel room (king bed for two) was spacious, clean, and comfortable. The decor was beautiful. The bathroom was huge and I'd even say glamorous. The giant bathtub prompted my boyfriend to take his first bubblebath in several years. The bed was large and very comfortable, and most importantly, the room was very quiet. There was a large TV with cable and available DVDs, a Bose stereo system, and a mini fridge. The hotel also offered free wifi, which was nice. There were some other perks offered (pillow bar (!), mini bar stuff, room service, etc.) that we didnt take advantage of, but it is nice to know a lot of things were readily available at our request. I loved the Conrad Chicago and will most definitely return for another stay. A fantastic hotel in a perfect location!", 
    "Awesome! Great price! Great location. Definitely will be back! Bar and common areas were beautiful!", 
    "We liked the hotel very much. Our stay was short but very nice and the customer service was great!", 
    "The perfect place in winter It is on top of the mall It's seems a bit old And if you don't pay for good view the view will be bad But I know I will come again ", 
    "Really nice hotel, close to the action, yet you feel you have a reprieve from the mayhem of Michigan ave.", 
    "Spacious room, average front desk , good location. Hotel bar staff were bland and unapproachable ; friendly housekeeping. Gym is well equipped.", 
    "Came to the Conrad after a weekend at the Courtyard Marriott on Ontario. Only made the change because the rate offered by the Conrad was so attractive. Didn't expect the beautiful room, comfy bed and spectacular bathroom. Location is perfect. Only disappointment was the view . . . but given the rate we were paying, I really couldn't complain.", 
    "I spent five days in the Conrad in October while attending a conference at a neighbouring hotel. I chose to stay at the Conrad, rather than the conference hotel, based on reviews I read online and believe me I made the right choice. I received excellent service from every employee I dealt with, and the facilities were both comfortable and attractive. My only quibble is the price of some of the onsite food, particularly breakfast items. 6$ for a mug of tea!", 
    "Perfect location for us. The service really was first rate. Very pleased with everything.", 
    "The parking expense was more than I had in CA so that was disappointing ", 
    "I chose the Conrad Chicago for a short stay in July. The trip was special as it was my mother's first time in Chicago. I wanted a hotel that was not only premium, but in a great location as well. I was definitely pleased to see how beautiful the hotel is. The outdoor terrace not only lovely, but a great place to take pictures. The room was spotless and the bathroom was spacious with a separate room for the toilet. All in all, we had a fantastic time and I look forward to staying at the Conrad again.", 
    "We really enjoyed our stay The rooms are quite large and the bathrooms are wonderful! The showers are huge. Staff is very friendly. Although there was free coffee in the lobby, I wish there were coffee makers in the rooms. I wish you didn't have to take two different elevators to go from the street entrance on Rush to your room. It is very convenient to have the Shops at North Bridge Mall attached to the hotel. We would definitely recommend this hotel.", 
    "Spur of the moment trip to Chicago. Booked room on expedia. Most likely the worst room at the Conrad. Extremely small with only a single small window in the corner. I feel that when I book on expedia, Conrad gives the worst room. Hotel was not full so we could have been offered a different room. Sound in the tv is terrible. ", 
    "Got such a good rate from Expedia I was worried the hotel wouldn't be so good, but it was excellent - in location, standard, quietness, service. Everything was all we could have asked for - and because we booked through Expedia we got free breakfast vouchers - something we weren't expecting but was a lovely finishing touch. Would definitely use again. ", 
    "The location of this hotel is excellent. Right off of Michigan Avenue in the heart of the Magnificent Mile. The lobby area is very nice and a great place to unwnd after a long day of shopping. The room was nicely appointed, although we had some issues with the toilet. After two attempts to fix it, they moved us to another room and we had no issues. I would certainly stay at this hotel again the next time I am in Chicago!", 
    "We were there for the Chicago Marathon and not in the hotel much. But it was very nice, clean and super comfortable. Great location in downtown Chicago.", 
    "Really nice hotel in a wonderful location. First trip to Chicago and found this to be a good homebase. High-end hotel without the stuffiness. The staff were very attentive and friendly. A little disappointed the windows don't open at all, but on the otherside they were so well-sealed there was very little noise (nearby construction, outside music at bar etc.). Made it a very restful oasis in a busy city. Large bath with separate WC and comfy tub. Easy walk to groceries (including Trader Joes).", 
    "Great hotel in the heart of the city. The room was the cleanest and most comfortable in Chicago. Great value for the price", 
    "Das Hotel liegt im Herzen von Chicago und viel kann zu Fuss erreicht werden. Best French Toast in town!!!", 
    "Nice hotel. Location is excellent (right on the magnificent mile next to Nordstroms) and rooms are large, quiet and comfortable. I don't know if all the rooms are handicapped accessible but ours was. For the location and niceness of the hotel, the price was fantastic. The staff were friendly and helpful. ", 
    "Great place!", 
    "The best hotel and location in chicago! We had such a wonderful time here. We will defently be back.", 
    "The hotel was the best I have stayed at in Chicago. Being from Chicago it is hard to surprise me but the Conrad did just that. Jes at the front desk was fantastic and our room was beyond what we imaged. Our new hotel when we go home!", 
    "All was great. The location was pretty ideal and the restaurant had a nice breakfast and great service. Outdoor cityscape with movie running and dinner location was fun to see.", 
    "Perfect location. Get a top room otherwise your view will not be worth the price.", 
    "The hotel staff was so nice, they went out of their way to make sure we had everything we needed. Great location. Very nice hotel.", 
    "This hotel seems to want to save on onduty staff. The hotel was clean and comfortable however whenever you looked for anyone on the staff they were hard to find. They had few people anywhere. Only one or two people were ever at the front desk even when very busy.", 
    "We were very pleased with our hotel. Nice and clean. Easy access. The restaurant is on the pricey side. Overall enjoyed our stay very much.", 
    "I had a great stay at this hotel. Location is fantastic, minutes from a ton of restaurants, shopping, and the subway. Service is on par with a hotel of this caiber. Friendly staff from concierge to front desk to housekeeping. Room condition was immaculate though decor is a bit conservative. Bathroom is huge and beds ultra comfy. At $200 a night out the door, this was a great deal in my opinion. I would stay here again.", 
    "We love the Conrad. Customer service is the best. Comfortable beds. Great space. Close to dining and shopping. Easy access to Nordstroms! This is our favorite hotel in Chicago!", 
    "Bed was comfortable, bathroom was nice and big. View was kind of terrible, but that's okay. The location is great if you like to shop and close to the El. Would stay here again in a heartbeat.", 
    "property was excellent and well situated. Staff were all efficient, friendly and helpful. My only complaint was that the fitness room did not have the cardio equipment that I prefer (generally found in fitness centers) but was open 24 hours and otherwise well equipped.", 
    "Beautiful hotel...wonderful staff...they kindly extended my check out time to accommodate my needs!", 
    "I had never stayed at a Conrad before and if I could, I would exclusively stay there from now on. The staff was incredibly friendly, the room was incredible and I can't wait to go back!", 
    "We stay in the city 4 or 5 times a year for a quick getaway.....with the exception of possibly The Trump....I think The Conrad is our our new favorite. It might not have the views that Trump has but at half the price who cares. The rooms are just as nice and for a $14 upgrade on here the room was huge. Not a complaint....room was spotless and the bed/pillows were outstanding. Highly recommend The Conrad.", 
    "Property's great but they would not accept Hilton Honors because we booked through hotels.com. Too bad. - all other hotels accept for rooms service and restaurant charges..", 
    "I was able to purchase a suite for the weekend and it was so amazing especially at night. The view cannot be beat.", 
    "Overall a great experience. My wife and I had a great weekend in Chicago. Lots of great restaurants close by. Breakfast in the Terrace room was fantastic.", 
    "This place is amazing. It had everything we needed and wanted and even more. The staff was extremely helpful and kind. I would recommend this place to everyone. Is was by far the best hotel I have ever stayed in. All I can say is wow!", 
    "The rooms were very clean although they seemed to be somewhat dated (the carpet was showing wear). Staff was pleasant. Breakfast was good. There was always quite a wait for service in the bar and we were disappointed that there were no in room movies to watch.", 
    "Staff was very gracious. Room was lovely. Would definitely come back.", 
    "Overall my stay was pleasant. The hotel looked very elegant, renovated and nice. I can't give 5 stars because my husband and I ordered room service on our first night, and it was just horrible. We ordered wings, gumbo, and s'mores. All 3 dishes were absolutely disgusting. They gave us 6 small buffalo wings, which were all dry and gross. The salty gumbo came with a spoonful of rice.... smaller than a child's serving...actually, smaller than a baby's serving. And the dessert, the \"s'mores\" came frozen with rock hard graham crackers. We spent nearly a benjamin for service that included 6 wings, salty gumbo with a dab of rice, and frozen/thawing s'mores. The hotel has nice staff and like I said before... it was clean and elegant... but I can't get the room service incident out of my mind. "

    "Very good. Concierge was great, desk personnel...there is room to improve. Chucks, food was yummy! Service a bit slow, but over all our experience was great.", 
    "Perfect location in the middle of everything, and the staff were fabulous, especially the concierge. No matter how many times we came down to them with questions they always had an answer and a smile ready for us. The only issue was the shower which made terrifying angry noises if you turned up the hot water too fast (or at all), but the hot water still worked so other than the scary noises it was fine. Good hotel, loved it", 
    "I recently stayed 4 nights at the Hard Rock Hotel, in Chicago. When I walked into my room, I was blown away. I stayed in room 2204, and it was amazing. Due to a bit of noise from the pipes (completely our of the hotels control), I was moved (reluctantly, because I loved my room). But then I went to 3101, and WOW again. The views, the feel of the rooms, and the sizes in both were simply great. As luck would have it, there was a small issue with the tub (did I mention there was a shower AND a tub in the suite? Pretty Nice.) The Hard Rock did everything they could to fix it, but they ultimately needed better access. Now, I'm pretty easy going, they could have moved me back to the first room and I would have been pleased. BUT NO. They UPGRADED me a SECOND time. I was moved to room 3502, which had a clear view of the river, TWO bathrooms, a living room, OH AND A POOL TABLE & PAC MAN MACHINE. Needless to say, overall, I'm equally impressed and awed with their facilities as I am with their customer service. I'll be returning again. ", 
    "We checked in Friday at 1PM and they had both of our rooms ready. We used the valet, and aside from a little google maps GPS trouble it was pretty easy to find! The valet was awesome, even ran to my car to grab my contacts box when I got to the room and realized I forgot it! The front desk staff was fantastic! Greeted our group with smiles even though we had Packer gear on for the draft. The gentleman that took all of our luggage up to our room came in and hung everything up and put our bags on fold out shelves (got a nice little tip for that!). Both rooms we got were very clean and in great condition. The water pressure was phenomenal. The only thing that was wrong was the toilet ran, but it wasn't too bad considering we basically got the rooms just to sleep! Overall I will definitely be back when I come to Chicago in August. I can't wait!", 
    "Old dirty hotel. My allergies were off the chart. There was an old rotten bottle of milk in the refrigerator. There was dirt in the corners and behind the doors. hotel in bad need of updates", 
    "I was not very impressed with the hotel or the staff. They did not seem friendly & when I asked them several questions it was quick short answers (there was no other hotel guests around or waiting to be helped). It was too dark in the hallways for us to see the room numbers clearly without getting up close to the doors. They did not ask how my stay was when I checked out. The refrigerator was stocked full of items & if you moved any of the items you were automatically charged, I had brought my own water with me. If you did not use the item, you had to go down to have them remove the charge.",

    "Large outdated grey rooms without any charm. Poor service for the astronomic prices they charge. The room service is a disaster. Nobody answer the phone to take your order. Poor service for breakfast. I was waiting for long time to be attended. The food is horrible. The only positive point is the location. ", 
    "We spent three nights at Hard Rock. We wanted to be close to the Symphony. Car park cost $65 per night! WOW!! The staff seemed to be indifferent. The room needed a real cleaning. The mattress on the bed was falling apart. It dipped in the middle. The stuffing was coming out. I was glad when it was time to move on.", 
    "Stayed for three nights this week, and I had a pretty good experience. The first night was unusually noisy (inside and out), so I had a tough time getting any decent sleep. The next two nights were much better, for some reason. The front desk staff is very helpful, and the maids did a great job of cleaning the rooms promptly and thoroughly. Prices seem a little high for what you get, because the rooms are not really out of the ordinary. I have stayed at several different places across Chicago, and this one is probably not in my top three. Still, the location is great, the rooms are clean, and the staff is friendly, so don't count them out if you get a chance to visit.",

    "Was disappointed there wasn't a Hard Rock Cafe inside the hotel. ", 
    "Stayed at Hard Rock Hotel, and staff could not have been more accommodating. We arrived early and needed you luggage held when leaving, they took very good care of us. I will be staying here again next time I visit Chicago. Room was very clean and comfortable. Loved the Rock n Roll themed items throughout the hotel.", 
    "First room was way two small, parking was crazy expensive. Got moved up to a larger room due to helpful accommodating staff. ", 
    "We came from St Louis for the weekend to see a show on the Near South Side. Although this hotel was more expensive than others closer to the venue, the extra price was well worth it. The area was clean, safe, and well-lit. We parked in a nearby parking garage and walked to the hotel late at night (midnight) with no worries. A CVS Pharmacy and Pop Mart within a few block radius made picking up any incidentals cheap and easy. The hotel had tons of amenities, such as valet parking and its own parking garage (with in and out privileges, but was also within walking distance from public transportation and other garages. The staff was friendly and helpful, the rooms clean and included extras (mini fridge, iron and ironing board, plus others upon request). Many attractions within easy walking distance, and others accessible through public transportation (also within walking distance). The area around the hotel is clean and safe--we had no concerns regarding walking from a nearby garage to the hotel late at night. ", 
    "Our stay at the Hard Rock was great. The room was modern, clean, and comfortable, however; it was in need of some repairs (loose bathroom tiles, drafty windows, etc). The hotel is in a very convenient location and is close to many great restaurants and stores. The staff was extremely friendly and helpful!", 
    "While this Hard Rock Hotel was great location, great price, you need to keep in mind about other things not included. Parking is a main thing if you drove. The hotel rents out fridge and wireless access is not free unless you purchased it as part of your room reservation. Overall, it's a nice place to stay.", 
    "The overall stay was great. The only concern was the bed mattress was a bit to firm for me. The pillows were to soft. ", 
    "Giordanos pizza, sweetwater tavern and Garrett's are right across the street. Several other food places and convenient stores are there as well. We walked to Millennium Park, Sheds Aquarium, and the Field Museum. Our room was clean and the staff was very nice. I would recommend buying your own parking from one of the nearby parking garages as we found 65 a night a bit on the high side. That being said, we would definitely stay here again.",

    "En el sitio perfecto para poder ver las zonas importantes de chicago, muy limpio comodo y muy buen servicio", 
    "The staff were very helpful; the room was clean and quiet. Our only problem was with a clogged toilet. It took two tries to get someone to fix it. . . two early morning calls. At check-out there were two incorrect items on our bill: one for overnight parking (we had arrived by train/taxi) and one for items from the snack tray (we didn't use anything). They were corrected . . .but still. Isn't this an old trick?", 
    "Only bad thing was couldnt adjust temperature. Was located close to all points we wanted to visit.", 
    "The hotel was nice. We reserved a city view room but the view wasn't as city as we expected. We were on the 12th floor but we didn't really get to see much of the city. The room was quite warm and we tried to get it to cool down but the fan wasn't working.", 
    "Hotel room temp could not be regulated, bathroom had hair on the floor before we moved a thing into it. We reserved the hotel with (5) known guests in the room. You would think there would be 5 towels and 5 places to sleep but there was not. Had to ask for both.", 
    "The staff was very nice and friendly. ..they made the stay for me and my 16 year old daughter very enjoyable. Restaurant was nice too. Drinks at the nearby bar were very pricey, however, so I'd recommend another watering hole if you were so inclined. ", 
    "First we were given a room that was already occupied. Our second room developed a leak while we were at dinner. The third room was good. The elevators are irregular and slow enough to make you late. ",

    "I booked a room with a \"city veiw.\" My city view was the top of a lower roof and the side of another building, nothing else could be seen. The hotel staff was very accomidating and switched me to a different room. When we got to that room it was evident that someone had been smoking in it. Again, the hotel staff was concerned and told me they would try to do something about it. Another thing was that my entire floor smelled like smoke when we came back at the end of the day. When I called the hotel staff they actually sent someone up to our floor to investigate and knocking on doors to find out who was smoking in their room so THANK YOU for that. I was impressed! After that I never smelled smoke the whole time we were there.", 
    "Great check-in to start with. Loved the location of our room, very comfortable and I will say the best bed I have slept in for a hotel!",

I tipped very well every time and don't expect better service but when told my car wld be there 15 mins I expected it sooner and before people that checked out after me. My husband and i were the last ones standing in the cold. Believe me the valet guy that brought my car didn't suffer but I will no longer stay there.", 
    "Will not stay at a Hard Rock Hotel again. Felt its ridiculous to be charged additional parking fee(an extremely high amount) on top of room charges. Parking should come with the establishment u are staying at, not be an additional fee. ", 
    "Personnell was professional and courteous although room condition was marginal...ripped curtains, stains on curtains and walls. ", 
    "Hotel was fine. Valet parking was not very timely. We waited about 45 minutes to get our car when trying to leave. We called and were told it would be 10-15 minutes and ended up being 45 minutes. ", 
    "No insulation...could hear everything in the hallway. ", 
    "I've stayed at 8 or more 4 star hotels in downtown Chicago and quite honestly many are a tad over rated. The Hard Rock was nice but it started out a little rough. I booked a King Tower room which is supposed to be a bi-level room with a king size bed. Well when I opened the door I was greeted by a full size bed that was less than 2ft away, next to the bed were 3 steps that led down into a sitting area with a couch and table. A horribly designed matchbox of a room. The view wasn't at all worth that struggle and the nice front desk hosts were all smiles when assuring me I'd love it. I didn't love and fortunately they quickly sent up keys to another room. Beware of the 36th floor. I was moved to the 14the floor in a standard room with a king bed and that was just fine. Of course no adjustment to my bill, like I don't know that the room I booked costs more.The bathrooms are quite nice though and the hotel bar and restaurant LOOKED nice.",

    "This was my first time staying at The Hard Rock Hotel and I absolutely LOVED it !! The room was a great size with an awesome bathroom. The hotel was clean and not filled with rowdy guest. The concierge gave great directions to local eateries and shopping locations. Beware of the extra $50 charge after your check out. The extra charge is dropped after 3-5 business days but, I'm just giving a heads up. Parking is another story. Chicago has horrible parking options. We parked in a parking garage behind the hotel and the cost was $42 a day !!! *Thumbs down* but, it is better than paying $60 for the hotel valet. Overall, this is a great hotel. I would definitely stay again only in another city with better parking. lol ", 
    "The hotel is soo old and there are a lot of noises. Also, there is a construction site right next to the hotel so sleeping was almost impossible for me and I was in the 25th floor. Basically, I will not stay at this hotel next time. Otherwise everything was great ",

    "A great 4 nights in Chicago. All was fantastic... especially Kyle working at Chuck's and the housekeeping service was awesome.", 
    "My husband and I stayed here on a little getaway. The Hotel staff were very friendly, helpful, and courteous. The bartender and waitress in the restaurant were especially nice! The room was large, bed was very comfy, temperature was good, and room and bathroom were spotless! The entire facility seemed very clean. We were on the 23rd floor, and the street noise in the morning was the only complaint I have. We were within walking distance of the Milennium Park, shopping on the Magnificent Mile, and the Theater District. We walked to all of these places/areas with ease. We will definitely go back, but may try for a room on a higher floor.", 
    "Hotel is ok. Almost everything in the room had an issue--bulbs burnt out, coffee maker broken, curtains would not close, toilet would not flush, mini bar never restocked. I reported each one of these issues and no one responded--nothing fixed. To top it off, I was seriously ill the last night--with a faulty toilet--and had to stay an extra night. It cost me almost the same for one more night than the entire three I had already paid for. I did not expect to get a night free, but felt taken advantage of. I could not sit up without getting ill so had no hope of checking out on time. I realize rates change, but that was ridiculous--have a little compassion. One dicounted night is not going to bankrupt an international hotel chain. But it does make for a bad review. Could be praising their consideration right now.", 
    "This was an awesome hotel. It was so close to everything, so nice and clean and updated! The staff was very friendly and helpful. Chucks was a great place to eat! The only downside was that we couldn't adjust the room temperature so it was a little warm for us. But all in all it was a great hotel that I will definitely stay at again!", 
    "I had one night in the hotel and arrived for check in around 11am in case a room happened to be available. There was, and the friendly front desk agent upgraded my room with no extra charge. He placed me in a corner room on the 7th floor that had fantastic views!! I LOVED the layout, the room was spacious, and the sizes of the windows/openness of the room only enhanced the \"big city\" feel. I left the blinds open all night for the full effect, and if there was noise due to Michigan Avenue below, it didn't bother me at all. The concierge also was super helpful. Perk: there's a ping pong table in the lobby.", 
    "Stayed on the 33rd floor in the tower suites, had great views up and down Michigan Ave, and also the lake. Had dinner at Chuck's, the food was awesome. Close to public transportation, so you could get around the city pretty fast.", 
    "nice clean rocking hotel with friendly staff and close to shops and a lot of things to do in the heart of Chicago its also one of the most interesting buildings in Chicago it has a plaque outside to prove it. it has great light airy rooms with mega comfy beds, I would have no problem recommending this hotel to anyone.",

    "Was in Chicago for a quick trip Great place to stay Very convenient to all sites to be seen Food at Chucks was awesome!", 
    "Perfect stay. This place is all about pleasure. The staff is awesome. ", 
    "Visited same hotel last year, Great staff, reasonable hotel.", 
    "The hotel location can't be beat, but we paid for it in discomfort. We expected city noise and live music noise, which was actually not too bad. The window was either not insulated or the seal was broken because our window covering blew in like the window was open and it was just as cold as if it had been. This may have been correctable if the thermostat worked properly, but the sensor must have been in an odd location because I'd set it at 72 and if felt like 62, but the thermostat said it was 80. The toilet wouldn't flush unless you held the handle down for quite awhile and it was very noisy for a long period after. The worse part was despite the room not being very warm it was so incredibly dry it woke me up at night.", 
    "This hotel was a very good value at a very convenient location to the Chicago Loop. The restaurant was excellent with a rather varied and unusual menu. A very nice change from the \"normal\" business hotel. The decor is \"Hard Rock\" motif and includes Fender guitars that you can check-out (like a lending library) and play in your room [BYOA = Bring your own amplifier]. The only unpleasant part of the stay was housekeeping beating on my door in the morning while I was sleeping. ", 
    "The biggest problem we had was when we first entered the room. The temperature was ungodly warm. We immediately turned down the thermostat and called the front desk. The front desk agent put us on hold. Whenshe reurned to the phone, she told us she had consulted the engineer who wanted us to open the window! First of all, it's very unusual to have windows that can open in a skyscraper. Second, it was not clear how to open them (couldn't they have come upstairs and done that for us?). Third, I had to move furniture to get to the window. Fourth, it was very difficult to get it open even a crack. Nevertheless, I thought we'd give it a try. We then went to the fitness room (very nice) for an hour. Upon our return we found half of the room very cold and the other half still hot. We called again, and this time we got the response we should have in the first place: they put us in a different room. The new room was great and the rest of the stay went as planned. First staff interaction: 1 star; second staff interaction: 5 stars.", 
    "Stay was great. Love the rock & roll vibe the hotel has and the wonderful amenities. We also had a great view of the city! Loved it. Would definitely stay here again! ", 
    "Needs better lighting in room, no vending machines.", 
    "The check in process was very quick and I was in my room within 10 minutes. The room was very clean and comfortable. However, there were a few little holes in the wall next to the TV. The mirror on the closet door also had a large dent in it. The only thing that I was very unhappy with was having a house keeper walk into my room thinking no one was in it while I was there, and coincidentally had just gotten out of the shower. Not a very nice surprise! ", 
    "This was a nice hotel the only problem is that there's extra charges for everything. We didn't even get a refrigerator or an microwave. I went in with high expectations for Hard Rock Hotel is very well known. I also visited the cafe, for me staying at the hotel I would expect some kind of discount but nothing, we didn't even have transportation to the restaurant ", 
    "First, before I say anything, I want to say how awesome the staff is at the Hard Rock. If the place did anything right it was the staff, that's for sure. But, for us, that's about as far as the good reviews go. So. Where to begin? Three o'clock rolls around and we decide to head to our hotel and check in. Putting the address to our GPS, we head that way and let me tell you... This hotel is horrendous to find! Though, surely not up to the hotel, the front street of the hotel was under construction. Now, we know this hotel has no say in the city streets but it would have been nice to know ahead of time. We got lost for over an hour. So, finally we find the place, and try to park. Not finding anything we call the hotel and ask for a suggestion. They tell us that the only parking the hotel \"supplies\" is a $60/day(?) valet with in and out privileges. Youch. That hurt. So we bite the bullet and give the car over to the valet then head inside. The staff was so friendly- I can't say that enough. We checked in quickly and then went to find our room. We push the elevator button and take the first one that comes open and try and press our floor number. The elevator zoomed all the way up to the 31st floor and we had a mini panic attack thinking, \"oh no! This things broken!\" Then, thankfully another staff member comes aboard our mini panic party and informs us that these certain elevators take us to certain floors. So we rode back down to the lobby and take our specific elevator to ", 
    "The room had an unpleasant smell but seemed clean. The bed was comfortable and the room was spacious. All of the staff we encountered were friendly and helpful. The fitness room was very nice with a good variety of equipment. A few machines were not working though and we did have an issue with the elevator. We had to figure out where the stairs were without any signs or anyone around to help. I tried the phone that was down there to call the desk but that wasn't working either.", 
    "Great location in the Loop area. Clean. Great experience. ", 
    "The hotel was great. Sadly parking is valet only and seriously expensive b", 
    "the workers were nice but the hotel wasn't all that the website said it to be then we arrived we were forced to pay for valet parking that we were not told about ahead of time.", 
    "Excellent - very nice staff and accommodating.", 
    "Had a wonderful Valentine's weekend, the hotel was amazing, the resturant down stairs was great..wouldn't stay anywhere else in Chicago. The view was breath taking. This is coming from someone who travels a ton. Great hotel", 
    "Hotel staff was very accommodating and let us check in early. Very close to lots of shops and restaurants! ", 
    "It was awwwwesome! Our Concierge - Ben was Outstanding. Bizzie at the Angels bar was super sweet!!! Eric at the restaurant bar was great, too!", 
    "Stayed for 3 nights at the Hard Rock Hotel for the Chicago Auto Show. Room was very spacious and fairly comfortable. The hotel is in the city yet it was a very peaceful stay. People working the front desk were very friendly and helpful as was the concierge guy. Valet parking was very prompt and professional. Would stay at the hotel again.", 
    "The room smelled like the bathroom hadn't been clean. The bathtub was gross. ", 
    "Very Welcoming Front desk, Little rude bell desk, but overall very nice rooms and fairly well maintained, Definitely worth for money.", 
    "It was good Put an itinerary of the bar music scene in the rooms and or lobby. Why do I have to ask 20 questions to the bar tender? Room was fun. Led Zepp. Great deal at $99 per night in the loop. Any classic rock ever or just Hip Hop. I know. I know. You gotta make $$$", 
    "Good place good peeps good food very knowledgeable homies ", 
    "Great Location, central to most downtown attractions and dining. Hotel staff, while nice were a little unprofessional in behavior, language, shouting, goofing off. Room was OK, showed signs of wear and tear, but generally nice. WOuld stay there again, but expected a bit more consiering price and Hard Rock brand image. Thier valetparking was $60 per day and nearby self parking was about $40 per day, so factor this into overall costs.", 
    "The bed was uncomfortable. The street noise from sirens kept me up.", 
    "Pillows smelled like body odor, bathroom was dirty (tub & tiles) Coffee pot did not work and when asked to please replace, we were treated like we were idiot's and did not know how to work it. Kureg, I have one at home. Most of the staff were very pleasant, but I expected much more for Hard Rock & Michigan Ave in Chicago.", 
    "Wonderful felt like a ROCKSTAR.", 
    "The Hard Rock was great! Edgy and super stylish but still comfortable! Only downside was parking. EXPENSIVE!!", 
    "Quick trip for family. Stayed Saturday night. Helpful staff and concierge when I left my toiletry bag. Chucks restaurant sufficed for adult beverages. $60 valet seemed a bit excessive but so be it. Clean comfortable rooms, theme wasn't oberbearing or too gimmicky. I'd recommend or stay again, especially for the price.", 
    "The Hard Rock is a nice hotel and convenient to much of what downtown has to offer. The rooms are beginning to show a little wear and tear--the lampshade was stained, and the linens were worn a little thin. But the staff is friendly and attentive, room service is good, and the rooms are comfortable and relatively quiet for being in the heart of downtown.", 
    "You know when the bars close as the young guests trickle in very loudly. If you are someone out partying with said guests, then this hotel is ideal for you. Otherwise, there are many other good Chicago hotels in this price range.", 
    "Had wonderful time during this trip and staff was good at the hotel and they made the arrangements for our wedding anniversary as I explained them. Scot was the one who took care of arrangements, special thanks to him. In room guitar was available but we didn't fet enough time to play with that.", 
    "Very welcoming staff, clean rooms and great price for the location of the hotel. Would definitely stay here again.", 
    "Everything was great, no issues to complain about.", 
    "I couldn't believe how noisy this hotel was - My husband and I got hardly any sleep. Plus the heat / air was broken so we were hot & uncomfortable. Location was good but I would have rather stayed somewhere in more of the heart of Michigan Ave.", 
    "Great views. Located right in the middle of Chicago.", 
    "Rooms and decor outdated, much smaller than they appear in . I would call this more of a 2 1/2 star hotel.", 
    "Convenient location, comfortable room, and courteous staff. I'll come back again.", 
    "Loved this hotel and the Hard Rock brand. Cool modern hotel inside, cool old building outside. Great location near shopping and dining. Staff was very courteous and helpful. Concierge gave excellent restaurant recommendations. Highly recommend!", 
    "Great time downtown. Great area. Blizzard didn't stop fun. ", 
    "I took a momcation for two nights for a break from work and family. I enjoyed the hotel, but it was a bit noisy due to location on North Michigan Ave. It was close to everything. The room was really nice and comfortable (although could use a little updating as it was a bit worn) and the staff was fine. Overall a positive experience and I would recommend this option.", 
    "It was a great location! Close to everything.Great service and very nice rooms:)", 
    "I really enjoyed my stay here. Its very clean, comfortable, and the view from my room was amazing.", 
    "Close to the magnificent mile . Close to millennium Park nice view from hotel very nice experience the hotel was real nice and clean everything is great", 
    "friendly staff, enjoyed the rock n roll theme. Outstanding restaurant in the hotel. ", 
    "Friendly staff upgraded us to a corner room with a fantastic view up Michigan Ave. Comfy bed, perfect views and great location. We were very happy.", 
    "Was in town for 2 days for work. Great location, great restaurant (Chucks), friendly staff and super clean! A great value too!", 
    "Great decor. Had issue with TV but was immediately fixed by the staff.", 
    "Beautiful place! Close to main Chicago attractions! I would definitely recommend it", 
    "Staff was great checking in but no help with my bill on at the check out. They did not know why I was overcharged and the others with me got the correct rate. I was shown the door and told to take it up with Hotels.com.", 
    "Room was in rough shape. This place used to be great, and has seen better times.", 
    "Great location", 
    "Great location right across from sweetwater tap house on miraculous mile in downtown chicago. A block away from billy goat tavern and plenty of shops. Saving money on the hotel allowed us to spend money on the experience rather than the stay.", 
    "excelente viaje", 
    "A disappointing experience. I had been wanting to try this hotel for some time. The hotel staff were all extremely nice and helpful. Unfortunately, I ended up next to a room of partiers. Had to call security a couple of times and ultimately get a different room. The second room had a strange banging noise in the walls that the building engineer couldn't identify or correct. I wouldn't stay here again. ", 
    "Breakfast, lunch, Museum, River walk , Dinner, nice walk and close to everything", 
    "Loved it cause it was near all the major tourist attractions of Chicago just a walk away...", 
    "Good area for visiting Chicago. Very nice building and design.", 
    "Excelente hotel muy bien situado y cerca de todo.", 
    "Great location near shopping, dining and entertainment. Loved the proximity (within 2 blocks) of Millennium Park. Easy access to all the great things on both Michigan Ave. and Wacker - including our favorite places like Giordano's Pizza and Garrett's Popcorn which were both within sight distance of The Hard Rock. We stayed on the 22nd floor and enjoyed a fantastic view looking north down Michigan Ave. at the Trump Building, the Hancock Tower, the Wrigley Building, etc. The staff was super friendly and helpful!", 
    "Overall I enjoyed my stay besides being overcharge for parking and finding a spider in the shower", 
    "Concierge was awesome!! Blackhawks and Bulls games where great.", 
    "Great hotel, very friendly and accommodating staff and beautiful rooms.", 
    "Overall a great place to stay. Walking distance from some great places. We had a blast", 
    "Enjoyed the get away and the hotel was great. The Concierge was a great help. The 3 of us had a good time. Only thing I would consider changes, I felt the parking was a little steep at $60 per day.", 
    "Hard Rock Hotel was very clean. Our room was spacious and located on a corner. We had a south & east view. The staff at the front desk and valet were efficient.", 
    "Close to Chicago attractions, shopping & theater. Clean room. Front desk help was very friendly", 
    "Nice enjoyed comfortable NICE view of Michigan ave and the lake.", 
    "Hotel is good if you plan to enjoy Chicago (City town )", 
    "every thing i thought it would be . then some.....'....", 
    "nice experience!!! Beautiful Hotel, great location...!!! very Roomy .... ", 
    "The stay was great,but i feel like they downgraded my room from the city view room to a regular king room.It wasn't my fault that the room had gnats in the bathroom when we checked in.", 
    "Beautiful location in the heart of the city in a beautiful art Deco building. Clean with a great vibe!", 
    "Perfect Location and awesome service! Loved it.", 
    "Love it", 
    "Awesome hotel in an awesome location. The only complaint I Have is that they had the \"indulgence bar\" (aka expensive food/drink in room) on a plate that charged you if the items were moved even slightly. Also, we couldn't use the fridge due to the same reason. It got to the point where I was afraid to touch anything for fear of being billed for it. Other than that, the hotel was really nice and the service was exceptional!", 
    "The cost of the room was reasonable for downtown Chicago, however the additional $60 parking fee was not disclosed up front and was automatically charged to the room. This made the price of the room jump from $130 a night to $190 a night. Well above other ones in the area. They did not provide the amenities that are standard for lesser cost hotel chains such as a fridge, microwave or other minor necessities. They did not provide any outside vending, so if you wanted something you have to pay in the room at the motion sensitive bar fridge or go outside the hotel. Overall, I would not recommend this as a place to stay if you want basic comforts. It was overly expensive with the undisclosed parking fee but adequate if you only needed a place to rest your head.", 
    "We checked into a room on the 4th floor and had an issue with the laundry shoot disturbing us and the view was less than desirable, so we asked to be moved. The hotel staff were more than willing to make the change. Our view on the 31st floor of the tower was breathtaking during the day and more so, at night! We would stay here again, any time!", 
    "quick post xmas holiday weekend in the city : ) Perfect spot close to everything river north despite being just south!", 
    "Nice", 
    "So,we booked the room for New Year's Eve so it was really busy in the hotel because they were having a party as well. The atmosphere was great!! It truly is a youthful modernized hotel. The room was smaller than I expected but very gorgeous and comfortable. My only complaints or more so dislike is that the lighting in the whole room was very dim. Me and my cousins were getting ready and doing hair and makeup and it just felt like the bathroom was not well lit. I know, I know that's really not that important, but when you need more light, you need light! My favorite part of the room was the bed! So comfortable! And the decor is very unique and Rock N'roll I inspired of course, very cool. I definitely would stay again.", 
    "My room was very bland and boring. Nothing special. After looking at pictures and seeing reviews I was very excited to stay at this nice hotel but when I arrived it was not what I expected at all. The staff was friendly but even when I offered to pay for an upgrade to have a nice room they didn't have anything. My room was no better then an average hotel just more costly. I will not be going back!", 
    "Not up to date bug n bathroom not comfy", 
    "This was a very nice hotel. We were able to walk most everywhere even museums. Clean friendly. Only complaint would be the restaurant Chucks. Had breakfast there last morning and it was terrible.", 
    "Booked my hotel through Expedia, so room was pre-paid. When my hotel stay was done, Hard Rock debited my account, then credited it back again for an amount that I had no idea what it was for. Again today, 5 days after my stay, Hard Rock is again debiting my account for what reason, I have no idea. Person I spoke with on the phone, just said that they debit our account on check-in. Two times? How many times do you need to debit my account?Would never stay here again. Not because of the hotel or room, but because this crazy accounting practice.", 
    "Have stayed at the Hard Rock several times since it opened. Seems to be getting a little worn and could use a little bit of an upgrade. Overall Great Stay and Good experience with staff and services.", 
    "We had a breathtaking view from our mini suite on the 33 rd floor. I always request a city view here. It is magnificent, as is the location, walking distance to everything. We will definitely stay here again.", 
    "Sadly, this is not the Hard Rock that we have come to love. Being our 6th stay in 4 years, we can see some disappointing changes. Or lack thereof. I will warn Expedia members, if you book here, they really don't care much for your business. In fact when I mentioned my dissatisfaction to the lady at the front desk she said \"I am sorry sir, but you booked through a third party, so there really isn't much more I can do.\" The issues I had this time were: The shampoo in the shower was half full and had obviously been used by the previous guest. The bathroom floor tiles were loose and the grout missing. The beds were poorly made and the fitted sheets, didn't fit. The room was not very clean. Smudges on the walls of the shower. Fingerprints on the mirror, empty minibar. None of these are really \"big deals\" but put together, i felt I needed to say something. I was sad with the response. We still love the location, and the feel of the Hard Rock, but it keeps slipping, and I am thinking our next visit to the Windy City may include a change of venue. We may give it one more shot...but it is debatable. ", 
    "would have liked a contintal breakfast, room was not as quite as i would have liked.", 
    "Hotel is in a great location, right on Michigan ave, recommend getting the rooms with a view of Michigan ave. Would stay again! Friendly staff that were helpful Downside Near the fire station and you hear all of the alarms. Hot water only Luke warm on Sunday checkout. Lastly our room was missing pictures off the wall :(", 
    "Short walk from hotel to parks, lake and downtown shopping ", 
    "Nice hotel but woke up early Sunday by the noise of construction that was next door off the hotel.", 
    "The check on process was very quick and the staff were friendly. Room was small but very clean. ", 
    "Family weekend downtown for shopping and dinner. The hotel location is great, the decor is very cool, but the room quality was not that great. The service was great at times and mediocre at times. Considering the choices in downtown Chicago, I would probably not stay there again.", 
    "Good service. Great vacation place. Definitely going to come back.", 
    "I have read other reviews that complain about the staff but that was not my experience. They were all very friendly even when we randomly ran into them in the halls. The room was a little cold when we got in (66F), but we just turned up the thermostat and then it was comfortable. The view from the hotel was fantastic. I would definitely stay here again. Plus the hotel looks very nice and was clean. They also have a restaurant and lounge where they have a DJ playing. We didn't stop by there though so I don't know the quality of the music. ", 
    "The stay were nice. I just didn't like the idea of them switching my king city view room to a regular king room.", 
    "I was in Chicago for a business meeting. Enjoy stay at different hotels and enjoy my stay with you.", 
    "A fine hotel at the corner of Michigan Ave and Wacker Dr. It is the closest hotel to the Brazilian Councel where you need to go to apply for visas. ", 
    "We stayed overnight on a Saturday. During the night or very early morning, I thought I heard vacuum cleaners running in other rooms. How early do they clean rooms at this hotel? On Sunday morning, we decided to have our bags stored downstairs with the valet while, instead of putting them in our car. I'm 99% sure my expensive bottle of Argon oil fell out of the side pocket of my backpack, along with a bottle of saline solution for my contacts & a phone charger. I called the hotel, spoke to valet & room service & there was no sign of any of these items. Strange.", 
    "Great location. Gorgeous Art Deco lobby. Good gym. Nice bars/restaurant. Dirty hallways. Totally unreliable room service. Front desk staff not empathetic/concerned about that.", 
    "The hotel was fine. Clean. Cool rooms. The hallway noise was way too loud inside room. Also the parking is a letdown. I won't go back there if I drive. The hotel should compensate for parking. ", 
    "Quick overnight stay/getaway for a romantic weekend. Easy check in. Unique hotel, nice amenities. Generous room size for a standard king room. Hard Rock is either walking distance to bars, shopping, restaurants or a quick cab ride away. Valet parking available with in and out privileges. I would stay here again.", 
    "Hotel was clean and staff was friendly. Nice finishes all around. ", 
    "I stayed for one night on business travel. I was pleased with the location, service and room. The hotel staff was friendly and helpful. The valet was super responsive. The room was clean and the bed was comfortable. It wasn't overly luxurious (fairly simple design) but it was better than most. If I had to nitpick I could say that the bathroom could be re-grouted but honestly, what does that matter? (I'm remodeling my bathroom or Id have never noticed!)", 
    "C grade. It's just \"ok\". Decorations are tired and need updating. But the carpet is cool and seems new. Lighting in room (and bathroom) is horrible, windows drafty, awkward closet but bed was comfortable. Bar was quaint...slow on Friday night but hopping when we returned on Saturday. Packed with almost all AA crowd with DJ. I'd recommend the hotel if you get a good deal. Great location in a historical building. I previously lived in downtown Chicago (River North) for 7 years, so I know the city well.", 
    "We were in and out in a flash weekend. The bar special was fabulous! The photo booth didn't have instructions posted, so we wasted a little time and money. Concierge was helpful, bellmen were courteous. Front desk staff was polite and efficient. Valet guys were great. Housekeeping was thorough. Room service was slow, but not terribly. Mini bar is unnecessary these days. We followed the \"save towels\" instructions, but all towels were taken. Not a big deal, for sure. But if you're offering the green option, you should follow through. Location is prime. Very pleasant experience!", 
    "My glasses were stolen out of my car When using the closest parking garage, I guess I should of used the hotels. P.s. Dont talk to the bums they will just hustle you trust me!", 
    "Really nice hotel BUT kinda overrated price wise and Wi-Fi wasn't working.Close to everything and Illinois Center was close for good eats of all kinds. Overnight parking was quite expensive as well. But, we enjoyed our stay and the hotel staff.", 
    "Would be nice if there was a casual menu at the restaurant, as we only wanted something simple but spent good money. Overall very good though.", 
    "It was ok. Room was small but nice. Water pressure in shower was weak. It's a nice no frills hotel.", 
    "They upgraded me for free. Perfect large corner room. So comfortable and a definite plus for my business stay", 
    "reserved the room ahead of time on my credit card. call the day before arrival I was told I could pay with cash so when we arrive we were told there was a $300 deposit required when paying with cash nobody told me that priorwe would receive the $300 back at the end of our stay.but we were using some of that 300 dollars for our weekend money. Nobody told us they require $60 per night for parking. no frigerator for our own cold drinks no microwave to heat up any leftovers. really not impressed with our stay", 
    "We arrived early so our room was not quite ready. We went for a walk and to have lunch. When we returned because the room was still not ready they upgraded us to a very nice room suite.", 
    "The location is fantastic! Staff was friendly and such a cool hotel for those of us who love classic rock. Each floor is themed for a rock star and there was a copy of Rolling Stone waiting for us in the room as well as a nice sounding iPod dock to play music. The room could have used a bit more lightning but we thoroughly enjoyed our stay here :)", 
    "I stayed at this hotel for a business trip. All I was expecting was a clean place to sleep. The hotel website made the hotel appear spacious, even boasts about the size of the rooms. They are actually small to average at best. The furniture is tired and worn. I was o.k. with that but thought I paid more than this hotel was worth and next time will not pick this hotel. The room seemed clean, except for some mold in the shower. The beds were comfortable, but sleeping was difficult with cars honking and sirens going all night and into the morning. I stayed on the 17th floor. I can't even imagine how bad it must be on lower levels. I have been to Chcago numerous times and have never had the street noise effect my sleep. I'm not sure if it's the position of the buildings or what, but it was really bad every night.", 
    "Enjoyed our stay", 
    "Good location right off of Michigan ave. close to shopping and food. Bed was comfy. Shower pressure was bad. Construction going on right next door was loud. Nice gym. ", 
    "Great location, cool hotel, staff was awesome and friendly. I'd definitely stay there again and recommend it to others.", 
    "We stayed at the Hard Rock for one night on November 8th. Check-in was a breeze and only took about 2 minutes. The front desk staff greeted us by name and were very friendly. They told us there had been a Red Bull conference in the hotel and offered us each complimentary Red Bull drinks. We had a room with a king size bed. We wound up with a corner room, which was great because it had windows on two walls. The windows overlooked the Chicago River and Michigan Ave. It was a great feature. The room was clean and the bathroom was large and clean as well. The location of the hotel was great too because we felt it was right in the middle of everything. We were able to walk everywhere we wanted to go. Overall, this was a very nice hotel for the price we paid and wouldn't hesitate to stay here again.", 
    "I loved the location and how convenient it was to almost everywhere I wanted to visit in Chicago. The staff was incredibly friendly! The food in the hotel restaurant was FABULOUS! In two days, I ate at the restaurant at least four times. I had an amazing visit and cannot wait to return!", 
    "The room and staff were nice. Most extras like breakfast and wifi in the room have additional fees. Also the king size bed is more like a small queen. But it was a good deal overall. ", 
    "Great customer service. Awesome atmosphere and really great location for travelers. ", 
    "I have never been in a hotel that had a fridge in it and not been able to use it without paying for what's in it that you don't want. Would have liked to have put my own pop and water in it. I also thought that paying the price for the room I should not have to pay 60.00 to valet my car at their hotel.. Sounds a little outrages to me. Also I had thought if you stay at the hard rock hotel the Hard Rock Cafe should be either in it or next to it , not 2 or 3 blocks away. Staying in downtown Chicago is very expensive and not very middle class friendly. I don't think I will go back, and didn't have time to see what I wanted to.", 
    "No complaints! There was an issue getting our room keys activated so for the wait they gave us a free round of drinks at the bar. Such good service! The room was beautiful and the floor was completely silent. For a weekend stay it felt like we had the whole place to ourselves!", 
    "Excellent view form our 33rd floor north west corner. Very good breakfast both in room and restaurant. We will be back....", 
    "Paying extra for Internet in 2014 ?? False Internet price on a room that's a few dollars under $300 for a Saturday night with tax . Then charge for Internet-. Hots in 3rd world countries don't charge for Internet. A Hotel on Michigan Ave needs to ?", 
    "great location, very nice hotel rooms. large rooms for right in downtown at this price. you can walk everywhere and just a few blocks from the train which you can get to the airport for $3 instead of a large taxi bill.", 
    "Lighting was bad in the room. Earphones went missing and there was nothing to the hotel would do about it, beyond an \"investigation\" (i.e. NO REFUND). Cell phone internet connection unavailable my entire stay. Major, major let down. ", 
    "Was given a spacious room with a great view. Bathroom surfaces need a little refreshing. Eager, young, professional staff. Close to both Millenium Park and Wacker Drive. A little pricey.", 
    "Not worth price for room. It's too noisy. Very expensive to park. ", 
    "Great staff. They let us check in early at 10:00 am with not extra fee! Awesome location!", 
    "Everything was fine - except for outrageous WiFi charges for terrible spotty service. As a business traveler, I need reliable service and usually stay at hotels that provide the service without a charge. This was a charge per device - per day and I was double charged. The desk clerk did not respond courteously and seemed indifferent to my concerns. ", 
    "Comfortable rooms, great location, close to many things, we got a great rate on expedia, would recommend to anyone staying in Chicago for the weekend, we loved it!", 
    "My wife and I went to see a concert in Chicago and chose to stay at the Hard Rock Hotel. The staff was very friendly and they upgraded our room to a room with an amazing view of Michigan avenue for free. The room was very spacious and extremely comfortable. I will always stay at this hotel anytime I'm in Chicago.", 
    "Although I am a die hard Hard Rock fan, I was not impressed with this hotel. There were items missing from the room and some of the \"details\" that you would expect from a hotel of this rating.", 
    "Waited 2.5hrs to check in after my arrival time of 2.30 in the afternoon. Shower water pressure is the worst I have experienced in 25 years of traveling . Must be flexible to reCh toilet paper !!", 
    "Other than the unfriendly welcome, service and conditions were great! Be careful to not move items in fridge, even for your drunk chicken ceasar wrap leftovers, because everything you touch is automatically billed to your room. The staff was awesome though and removed it from our bill. Location? 10 out of 10! You should stay here simply for this reason.", 
    "It was an average hotel that is over priced for the experience. Restaurant was one of the poorer experiences we have had and service mediocre. The elevator by floor was confusing. We had a friend staying on another floor and always had to go down to lobby and switch elevators. The coffee machine did not work in our room. The noise outside our room was awful. When someone went into their room, it sounded just like they were trying to get into our room. Hallway to the room is very dark and hard time seeing room #'s. My wife did not like going down the hallway alone. ", 
    "It's a very nice Hotel. The suff is so friendly. I had a fantasitc time there. The shower wasn't that clean but the rest was perfect. If I'm back in Chicago I will choose this Hotel again. ", 
    "For 300 would expect more than a comfort inn. Just nothing special for a high end price", 
    "Great hotel for a weekend getaway. Great entertainment and crowd.", 
    "Near everything that its turistic Comfortable beds Clean rooms Most important i didnt lost anithing at the hotel", 
    "Went for the Chicago Marathon. The location was great! It was an average hotel for paying as much as my mom and I did, but we figured the prices were up because of the marathon.", 
    "The hotel facilities, condition and cleanliness were excellent. The room was very comfortable and had a great view. I would recommended it to younger travelers, e.g. students or under the age of 35 since the theme of the hotel is very modern, but it is not something that would bother families or older couples and/or friends. ", 
    "This was a PERFECT hotel for the price it was offered at.", 
    "Room air did not work. Bathroom had mold and grout chipped out.", 
    "The staff at hard rock were fantastic 100% brilliant. The menu lets the hotel down or lack of menu. In the room lack of viewing on the TV would be more comfortable to actually have programmes on there. Stopped in a lot better hotels but never had a hotel were the staff are just amazing and it's the staff that make the hard rock hotel. ", 
    "Nice hotel but the Room smelled like bad bathroom odor. They switched our rooms though. Next was better. Comfort is excellent. I didn't like that I had to pay for wifi since we booked through. 3rd party. Parking was expensive. ", 
    "Good one TO visit", 
    "Booked for a Ladies Weekend and it was perfect! Location was best for great shopping, restaurants and theater. Could walk to ALL! Service was fast when we asked for more towels and coffee. Bar was fun on Saturday night for dancing. For a large busy hotel, it was quiet enough for a good sleep. View from floor 13 was good.", 
    "Overall, great location for the race and comfortable rooms - despite the pipes rattling in the shower and the window not shutting properly, so you would continually hear the construction and sirens.", 
    "Very pleasant experience. Most of the employees were friendly and helpful. The room was quite comfortable.", 
    "Very nice, and the staff very friendly and helpful. The only negative was the motion sensor snack bar that if accidently nudged could result in a charge on the bill. This item should be placed in a more isolated location in the room.", 
    "Fantastic hotel shame I was only there for one night!", 
    "great stay at the Hard Rock. Love all of the music playing, good vibe at this place", 
    "Excelente y de Maravilla", 
    "Overall great stay!! Did not care for the huge marylin manson picture on the wall but whatever. The lounge was nice good drinks, got dessert from the restaurant to take to my room and it was just thrown in some foil pans and was pretty lousy. Other than that i had a great stay", 
    "Well the Bears lost, who'd have thought?! But the sunshine, shops, lake front walk, Ditka's steak, and the hotel room made for a great weekend.", 
    "Muy amable el personal. Bien ubicado y suficiente en tamano de la habitacion", 
    "Great stay all around. Brought a fender guitar to our room and the hotel bar knows how to turn up on the weekend", 
    "Decor is very dark and gloomy bordering on depressing!! the comforter had dirty stains on it but toilet was roomy and very clean.", 
    "Excellent hotel and restaurant!!!", 
    "The outside of the hotel looks nice and is centrally located to lots of good places to eat and shop. The inside is not as nice. The bathroom floors had severe water damage which made waking on them uncomfortable. It was like surfing your way across the bathroom. If you want to change the pressure on the shower head prepare for a loud tea kettle squeal that doesn't stop. The magnified mirrors light didn't work. Sirens went off all night. You can't use the mini fridge because it has those sensors that charge you in them. The bed was smaller than expected and the pillows were miserably flat... Both of them. On the plus side they stored our luggage for us while we walked around. All in all our hotel was the most expensive and worst part of our trip. We won't be back here again as there are better options."
