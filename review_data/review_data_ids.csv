mturk,"Affinia Chicago is one of the worst hotels I have ever stayed at. Not in my life have I been treated so poorly as a guest. The front desk was very unaccommodating when I asked for a smoke free room when they had made an error in my reservation. There was no bellhop available for some strange reason so I had to move all my luggage to the elevator and down a long hallway to my room by myself. If it wasn't already a bad stay, I ordered room service and it took over an hour and a half to be delivered. If they didn't have air conditioning in the room, I would say just about everything about this stay was completely miserable. If you are traveling to Chicago for any kind of business, I hope you decide not to choose this hotel. I was quite surprised, I like Chicago as a city but this stay definitely made my trip quite a negative experience.",0,0,murk_n0
mturk,"I recently stayed at the Affina Chicago hotel and was really dissappointed. When I arrived, the desk clerk was really slow checking me in. I feel like turtles could have checked me in faster. I was finally checked in and my room was on the 8th floor. The elevator ride seemed to take forever. I arrived and the room and at first glance it looked great, but after looking everything over there were finger smudges on the glass table. I figured maybe room cleanin must have accidentally touched it. I went to the C-House for supper that evening and I had to wait for what seemed like forever. The meal was good, but my waitress was very uptight. On my way back to my room, I asked the front desk to set up a wake up call for 6 AM the next morning and they were very grateful to set that up. It would have been nice to actually get it though. The next morning I surprisingly work up at 7:18 AM and realized that I had not received a wake up call. I was very upset and let them know. Overall this experience was not worth the 4 stars that this hotel has been given. For the price, quality and ratings the Affina Chicago hotel has been given, I would expect better service.",0,0,murk_n1
mturk,"I stayed at the Affina Chicago for my anniversary. The hotel is in a great location, but that doesn't make up for the poor customer service and rudeness of the staff. It looked like the cleaning crew forgot to vacuum from the last guest since there was hair on the carpet. I spent more money than I would normally, hoping for a luxury experience, and left very unsatisfied.",0,0,murk_n2
mturk,"If you are looking for a high end hotel on the Magnificent Mile, the Affinia Chicago is NOT your best option. First of all, the ""central"" location is not so convenient - there is quite a hike to the Navy Pier (which this hotel claims to be the ""official"" hotel of) and to the shops on the Mile. Secondly, the hotel is small - only 215 rooms, most of which are miniscule by comparison to the other hotels in the area. Thirdly, they have one restaurant and one lounge, both of which offer the same menu which seems a bit bizarre for a high end hotel. Finally the Affinia has one of the most rude staffs ever witnessed in a luxury hotel. One does expect some courtesy at the outrageous prices but be ready for the attitude and snobbery that will greet you at the Affinia!",0,0,murk_n3
mturk,"I just returned from a long weekend in Chicago with my wife. We stayed at the Affinia hotel and I can't even begin to describe what an awful experience it was. When we arrived at 4pm on Thursday (check-in is 3pm), our room was not ready. We had to wait til almost 5pm before we could even get into the room. Once inside the room smelled like an ash tray. Obviously someone had deactivated the smoke detectors somehow and had been smoking in the room. We decided to just go out for an early dinner. After arriving back to our room around 9pm, our key didn't work. We had to go all the way back down to the lobby to get a new one. The next morning the maids started knocking on our door at 7:30 in the morning! Why would you try to clean the room that early??!! The 'do not disturb' sign was on our door for the rest of the stay. After that early wakeup, we went downstairs to request a different room due to the terrible smell in the one we were assigned. The front desk employee gave me a very condescending look and sighed when I asked. Eventually we did get a new room but I didn't enjoy the demeanor I encountered to do so. Our new room was fairly nice, and the rest of the stay was relatively uneventful, but I have a bad taste in my mouth and likely won't stay there again.",0,0,murk_n4
mturk,"My wife and I stayed at the Affinia Chicago last week (in a studio suite, which was NOT worth the extra payment). It was an absolute NIGHTMARE! To begin with, the room is listed as 'oversized', when it's nothing of the sort. We've previously stayed in the hotel and the regular guest room is only about 2 square feet smaller. I believe the only extra space was in the closet, which isn't very useful unless you plan on living there! We had our two sons with us, so we had to make extra sleeping space. Our oldest son slept on the couch and woke up multiple times in the time, complaining of bugs moving around. He must have been umcomfortable also, as I sat on the couch during the day and it was like a rock. The room service is horrible, they took 47 minutes to deliver a pillow for my wife around 10pm, and she had to wait up for that. My family would NEVER go back to this hotel, and I highly recommend you also stay well away.",0,0,murk_n5
mturk,"Terrible experience, I will not stay here again. The walls were so thin that I was kept up all night by the party going on in the suite next to mine. I talked to the management several times, but nothing was done. It may just be the people that I had contact with, but I thought the staff was standoffish and rude. Very unpleasant experience, especially given the cost of staying here!",0,0,murk_n6
mturk,"I stayed at the Affnia hotel in Chicago and was extremely unsatisfied. I would recommend everyone to avoid this hotel. I paid $700 overall for 2 nights in a cheap, small, untidy room. Granted, I've stayed at hotels of similar quality, but never have I paid so much for one of them! I could not believe what I saw when I walked into the room...it was tiny and there was small patches of mold on the wall (that had been painted over). The breakfast I ordered wasn't terrible, but certainly wasn't good. The wifi connection was horrendously slow. If you want to spend a big buck on a hotel, fine...just don't spend it here.",0,0,murk_n7
mturk,"After reading good reviews about the Affinia Hotel in Chicago, my husband and I decided to spend two nights there to celebrate our 30th anniversary. Unfortunately, the hotel missed the mark for us. I did not expect to find bedbugs underneath the mattress in a 4-star hotel. Because my husband and I have had a bad experience with bedbugs, as a rule, we always check underneath the mattress before settling down for the night in any hotel. When I brought this to the attention of the front desk staff, they practically accused us of planting the bugs there. I was very humiliated and disappointed in the way the situation was handled. Needless to say, we made the decision to pack our bags and went elsewhere to celebrate our anniversary. I have written a letter to the hotel chain and hope that they will be more responsive to the situation. I have also reported the incident to my credit card company to alert them that I will be refuting the charge for the one night the Affinia charged to my account because we missed the cancellation deadline.",0,0,murk_n8

When I arrived to check in, my reservation that I had made, (and confirmed), 2 weeks earlier, was not in the computer.I had to wait 40 minutes in the lobby while a room was being cleaned for me. The whole time the desk clerk gave me dirty looks and texted non-stop on her cell phone, while the office phone rang off the hook.

mturk,"The Affinia in Chicago obviously caters to wedding guests and corporations hosting business conferences. If you do not represent one of these groups with a large number of guests and revenue for Affinia, do not expect any measure of customer service and don't expect great accommodations, even at their high prices. When we arrived our reservation was lost, then it took forever for the concierge to tell us the room we were instead given was available. The furnishings in the room were cheaply made, the cleaning obviously superficial and our view was directly into the concrete wall of the hotel's L shaped corridor. I called for fresh linens and toiletries and a very rude phone attendant told me someone would essentially be then when they had time. Two hours later someone came. The dining hall and reception areas were really nice, but again, unless you're a large group don't expect to enjoy them during your stay at Affinia. Even if you could, the prices wouldn't be worth it.",0,0,murk_n11
mturk,"I recently stayed at the Affinia Hotel in Chicago, and it was one of the worst experiences I've ever had at a high-end hotel. I was in Chicago for a conference, and I thought I would enjoy the experience more if I had somewhere pleasant and relaxing to return to, but this hotel definitely wasn't that place. The restaurants were mediocre at best, despite their high prices; I repeatedly got food that was bland, overcooked, or lukewarm. The room was fine, but nothing special; I think I'd have been just as comfortable in almost any hotel in downtown Chicago. A big part of my discomfort and dissatisfaction with the hotel, though, was with their Jet Set Pets program; it's hard to find a decent, relaxing hotel that I'll like that will also accept my dog. But many of the employees were rude about my adopted mutt, who is energetic and loves people but isn't the most photogenic dog - he has a scar on his face and he's got that terrier look. Multiple people mocked him, or said there was no point grooming him, or asked why I wanted him sleeping on a bed in my room. I know that it's a fairly high-end hotel, but I would hope for better service regardless of the class associations of the dogs. I hope they at least treat all of the dogs boarded there well. The experience was overall frustrating and unsatisfactory, especially for the price. I can give them good marks on their spa services, and I really appreciated the pillow ""menu,"" but other than that it didn't feel like a particularly luxurious or indulgent experience, especially given the customer service.",0,0,murk_n12
mturk,"Extremely disappointed in our stay. This hotel did not look like what pictures portrayed online. I booked online thinking what a perfect place this was going to be, only to arrive and have a room without a view even though that is what was paid for. The room smelled musty and not clean. Garbage was not changed from prior person. Found small ants in bathroom near shower. Called to complain and someone came up 2 hours later and used bug spray. Overall this hotel is in a great location, but we would never visit again. Staff was not overly friendly or helpful and the room was not as all as it seemed online.",0,0,murk_n13
mturk,"Affinia hotel in Chicago was one of the most interesting hotels I have ever stayed in. Everything looks very nice and fancy, though the people that work there must be from the projects of Chicago. The customer service was the worst I have ever experienced in my life! When we went to check in, first we had to wait about 15 minutes for the 3 workers that were at the desk to stop their personal conversation and check us in. When the women at the counter finally acknowledged us, she was smacking her gum, and was upset and treating us like we were inconveniencing her! The room service brought us cold eggs for breakfast, and the attitude of the staff overall was extremely rude.

With its neo-classical stylings and its non-classical service, it is just a combination for trouble, We had established our reservations for Friday the 15th amd arrived at 4pm to check-in. No Room. One hour after their posted check in time and nothing. No apology, no offer for upgrade, no discount. Nothing.

mturk,"Our trip to Chicago was a complete delight despite our stay at the Affinia Hotel. Because their rates were actually higher than we were used to in New York City, we naturally assumed we would get a nicer establishment. We could not have been more wrong. This place focuses on gimmicks to set themselves apart from their competition. Uunfortunately, it does set them apart but in a strictly negative way. Both the ""Dream Pillow Menu"" and the ""Experience Kit"" were a complete flop. With the ""Dream Pillow Menu"", the hotel offered patrons what seemed to be great pillow choices from down-stuffed to hypoallergenic selections. We happily chose the fluffy down pillows but when we got to our room and laid down on them a giant poof of dust came out. At first, I thought it was my imagination so I stood up and hit the pillows on the edge of the bed. More dust came out them! Particles were flying around the room, I'm now sneezing and there was this disgusting grit all over my sunglasses that were sitting on the night stand. I called the desk and they sent up replacements for all the pillows. These pillows were some kind of ""music pillow"" that pluged into an mp3 player. I was sleeping on uncomfortable cords all night. In general, the staff was pleasant and tried to be accommodating, but there was just no apology good enough for filthy pillows. Another failed gimmick they offered was the ""Experience Kits"". We were given (ours to keep) a collection of some maps (which were actually very nice), a walking tour guide that was all marked up, and a handy deck of cards opened and missing two cards. If this place lacked attention to detail, that is one thing, but it lacked any attention at all. If the pillows weren't already enough, at this point I was certain that I would never stay at this establishment again. Run, don't walk away from this place.",0,0,murk_n16
mturk,"I truly am not the sort of person to write a negative review about an establishment, but my time spent at the Affinia Hotel in Chicago forced me to do so. It was to be our first trip to Chicago since I was a boy so my wife and I were very excited to arrive and begin our short weekend getaway as soon as we checked into the hotel. First I must say that the counter help was far less than helpful. The apparently confused person who was to sign us in was extremely out matched when it came to the workings of the hotel computer and was total inept at customer service. He said we had not reserved a room, which I had weeks earlier, and proceed to explain to us that his hotel does not make mistakes of this kind and that WE must be mistaken as to the reservation or the hotel or both. Finally the manager arrived after I insisted on his presents. He did straiten out the confusion, but the room we were lead to was much smaller than we were lead to believe and had not even been cleaned from the last occupants. I called down to the front and demanded that the manager walk himself to our room and see the condition of the place. We were shown to another room, this time to our liking. From that point on nothing and no one that we saw or had contact with worked or acted as one would expect from a hotel with the reputation that the Affinia had. To list just a few; the television was a 13 inch black and white which could get only 4 channels, the food that room service brought up was cold, lifeless and bland, the cleaning person knocked at our door at 5 in the morning every morning even with the 'Do Not Disturb' sign on the door, and there was this ever so slight smell of mold and vomit which passed through the hallway every time my wife and I lift the room. To be blunt, I truly hope that the CEO of the company reads this note and fires the entire staff, guts the building thoroughly, and is publicly flogged in a downtown park. WE WILL NEVER STEP THROUGH THE DOORS OF THE AFFINIA AGAIN.",0,0,murk_n17
mturk,"Hello, I recently stayed at the Affinia hotel in Chicago, and was very unhappy when I learned of additional charges upon arrival. When I made the reservations over the phone there was no mention of any internet or parking fees. When I arrive I'm told fee to valet park is $49 per day, plus another $10 for internet. This is just plain ridiculous, and will remember not to stay here in future. There's too many other fine hotels that don't charge these fees.",0,0,murk_n18
mturk,"What I hoped would be a pleasant stay turned into a nightmare. The first sign of trouble at the Affinia was that they couldn't find my reservation. Add to that the room service delivered cold food after a long wait and the mini bar was not well stocked. The internet service was so slow it was unusable. To top it off the street noise seemed to penetrate the thin walls with ease making getting a good night sleep nearly impossible. Finally, I discovered the valet parking, which was a $49 premium service, dented my fender and scratched the door paint on my car.

Like we were bothering her and interrupting her day by wanting to book a weekend. The bell hop took our bags to our room, none to gently. My wife and I watched as he threw our luggage on the floor in our room. Which wasn't that bad till he actually asked for a tip! Our room was okay. The bed was sort of rough and made a odd plastic rubbing noise every time you moved. The next day my wife went out and returned to find our room wasn't cleaned.

I felt that the house keepers gave us dirty looks as we went in and out of the room.

I booked the hotel stay for over a week, which was very expensive, and that seemed to not matter to them at ALL, despite that fact that I was travelling with a small child as well! They did nothing to accommodate me, and the woman at the front desk even refused rudely to take my calls or answer any questions about nearby restaraunts insisting that even though she worked there she ""didn't know the area"" To tope it all off, the fitness center was under construction so I never got to use it.

Upon arriving, the demeanor of the hotel staff was rude and distant. Not enough to warrant a verbal complaint, but enough to make my daughter and I feel uneasy. After check-in, which took at least 20 minutes due to severe under-staffing, we headed to our room trying to be optimistic. Our room was much smaller than the photos on the hotel site suggested, the sink faucet in the bathroom was leaky enough to make a constantly irritating sound, and we only had a stock of 2 towels, which were never replaced during our stay. We made sure to spend as much time exploring the city as possible just to avoid going back to the hotel. It was a huge disappointment, for me as the customer and for my daughter as the birthday girl.

Once I recieved my key and entered my room I realized that I had been checked into a dirty room. I called the front desk and asked for a new room and the same desk rep. that I had previously checked in with told me that there wern't anymore available rooms. She told me that I needed to come back down to the lobby. As I approched the desk I heard her yelling at a housekeeper. She then told me that it would be a 15 minute wait and my room would be ready. I didn't have the energy to complain at that point having traveled on a plane for the past 4 hours so I just sat in the lobby waiting for my room to be cleaned. While I was waiting I watched another person being checked in and they were not only given a room without a reservation but they were upgraded to a suite at no extra charge - why was I not given that suite after what I just went through? 35 minutes later the desk rep came over to me and let me know that my room was ready. I went back up to the same room that I had previously entered. It was clean but there was no toliet paper and no towels. I called back down to the desk rep and she said house keeping would be on thier way with the items.

The maid hadn't finished the room and she'd left her stuff behind! Of course we called the desk right away and got a new room but it was a huge hassle. The next problem was the dog of the person across the hall and down one. We knew this was a pet friendly hotel but we envisioned well controlled, non barking pets. This animal barked repeatedly when my kids were trying to go to sleep. I called the desk twice and eventually the barking stopped. I think the dog just gave up because it didn't sound like the desk staff knew what to do. The crowning disaster, at least for my kids and husband, was that the remote control for the tv was dead.

When we called the front desk it took over an hour for someone from housekeeping to stop by. Past this - the room itself - it has flair I guess, but I can't imagine it is the right flair for many. The colorings used a bright blue on the bed and a muted yellow, designy wallpaper. Neither myself or my wife found it relaxing at all. I can't imagine many would. It really was off-putting.

By this time, we were so tired from the flight and the first impressions, we almost wanted to throw the towel in. Customer service was so lacking! We wanted to get settled and go grab a bit in the city, but had to wait around for our new room and the crib. This is not what we expected at all for this HIGH price!

My AAA membership did not get me a very good discount like it does at most hotels. The staff was not very friendly or helpful when I had questions about the area, and they were not very prompt when responding to requests.

Not having the room I requested and was assured was available is completely unacceptable for the high prices of this supposedly high end luxurious hotel.

Although she did look up some attractions, it seems like she may have recently arrived from LA. As far as the room, it was indeed luxury and had nice lighting and decoration. However, the noise from the adjoining room was unbelievable and kept us up all night. Most likely, the walls are very thin, and construction is not the greatest.

The room that I checked into was dingy with paint peeling from the walls, and the carpet looked like it hadn't been vacuumed since god knows when. Since I was only staying one night, I decided not to ask for a different room- although I don't know if asking for a different room would've made any difference considering the lack of hospitality from the reception desk. When I arrived, there were two receptionists chatting it up- no acknowledgement, no prompt service. I had to wait about 3 minutes although I was the only one in line before any of them acknowledged me. And no, they weren't talking about hotel matters. I'm not a difficult or an especially picky person, and who doesn't chat during work with their co-workers but for them to completely ignore and make a client wait for 3 minutes shows serious lack of professionalism.

I had to ask for a maid to come and give me clean towels because some of the towels in the bathroom were damp. On top of that, the bed was messily done; I could have done a better job on my own bed at home. I was angry at this point, because I was paying a lot of money for every night I was staying at Amalfi, and I didn't expect to be greeted with wet towels. I needed to use the Wi-Fi to download some important documents, and the internet was surprisingly slow. Even a very basic hotel or motel could have offered better, maybe even faster internet access.

Yeah right! I wish I could give it negative stars I don't even know where to begin. Normally with these reviews I try to outline the aspects that stood out, but it's just so overwhelmingly bad. Anyhow, here it goes: To begin with, the customer service stank. You think you've seen rude service people before? Well, this is customer service stuff of nightmares. I had a reservation, but I still had to wait for 30 minutes (yes, I counted) for someone just to pay attention to me. When she did, finally, she was chewing gum. No visible uniform or name tag. Clearly didn't want to be here. She took one glance at my reservation, didn't enter anything into the computer at all, and told me that they couldn't accept it, because the date had already passed. WHAT? The date for the reservation I had written down was *that day.* I was furious. After a 20 minute shouting match, and an equally incompetent manager that left me so angry I could scream, they finally, grudgingly accepted my name and reservation into the computer, so that I could book my room. Then, there was the room itself. On first glance, it appeared clean, but a closer inspection revealed: black mold on the bathroom ceiling, a sink tap that gushed rusty-looking *brown* water, a minibar which was picked at, the remnants looking like they had been there for several years, and a mattress with a mysteriously disgusting yellow stain on it. The pillowcases also looked yellowed, but I couldn't decide if I was beginning to see things, I was already so upset with the place.

I was the only customer in the lobby and he directed me to a rack of brochures located near the concierge then went back to leaning against the counter. On the plus side the room was lovely, but when I called for room service at 9:30pm I was told they were closed even though the menu said they served until 10pm. I decided to go out rather than fight the issue. The next day the tone was the same at the pool, the bar, the restaurant etc. The staff here seems to have a general feeling that the guests are lucky enough to stay in such a chic hotel and they are more like part of the atmosphere instead of actual employees with a job to do. The only exception was the housekeeping staff. I called them for extra pillows and another blanket and they were at my door in 10 minutes and made to ask if there was anything else I needed before leaving. The bottom line is that I booked my room here with the intention to relax for a day or two after my business was completed but decided against it.

We proceeded to dinner at Keefer's Restaurant and had to wait an additional 45 minutes past our reservation time. I have my suspicions we were segregated upon because of our casual attire; opposed to the elegant environment that was prominent throughout the restaurant. The next day, I could not get the wireless in the room to work correctly, and had to finish some work at our friend's house.

There was supposed to be a small refrigerator in the room. There wasn't, although I did not bother to complain after all it did when they gave me the wrong bed. At night, there seemed to be some sort of convention being held at the hotel. I did not figure what the convention was for, but their attendees liked to stay up until the early morning and made way too much noise. I called the front desk several times complaining about the noise. Each time they assured me they would deal with the noise, but the racket never dissipated and I finally gave up getting any sleep.

Maybe there was someone new on the staff that didn't know how to make a bed, but besides that, the sheets were starched to military stiffness. It was so uncomfortable! When I asked if we might get some new sheets, the staff were so incredibly rude and told me I was basically stuck with what I had because they're ""all that way"". I was appalled!

What a jip! After the kind of ""fun"" we'd had, we realized we couldn't handle anymore. We called for a manager the next morning and fought with him for a couple hours. We wanted to just cancel the second night of our stay, and he said he'd do that, but that we'd still be charged a percentage of it!

The room service that I ordered took forty minutes to arrive, and my steak was cold and cooked beyond well done. Elsewhere in the hotel things were no better.

I called ahead to ensure a SW view that would allow us to watch the airshow from our room if the weather did not permit us to watch from one of the nearby beaches. Upon arrival at the hotel, not only was our room on the west side of the hotel it wasn't even a single king as was requested. Apparently the hotel had overbooked king rooms for the event weekend and we were downgraded to a queen room. The room itself was small and underwhelming. The was not dirty, but the linens and furnishings all had a very old and worn feel. The hotel was packed the weekend we visited. The staff was obviously not prepared to cater to such a large crowd. The concierge and reception desks were continuously busy. The hotel restaurant was very slow and had long waits. The main lobby and other common areas throughout the hotel were also undergoing renovations making getting around and fighting crowds of other people even more difficult!

After checking in, we went up to our room and were a bit disappointed.

Even though I think $10 for 1 day of internet is RIDICULOUS, I bought it because I needed to download a powerpoint for work and send off a few emails.

The staff and amenities were also very unfriendly to children. My kids were absolutely terrified of several members of the staff who scowled at them and yelled at them for no reason. The place was also very formal and stiff and decorated with a lot of breakable and expensive items. My son narrowly avoided breaking a vase when an ill tempered bellhop nearly ran him down with a luggage cart.

Her snide remarks towards my wife and me set the tone for a the rest of our stay. After getting our card, we were finally offered help with our luggage. The young man who helped us could barely handle our luggage. Strangely, he somehow found more strength when it was time to collect his tip. He received the tip he deserved, which he scoffed about and groaned under his breath as he walked away. Upon first looking at the room it was beautiful. However, closer inspection revealed that the room had NOT been cleaned since the last visitor had left. There was hair in the sink and around the toilet. There was even a used bar of soap in the bathtub. This fact was not met with any apology by hotel staff. Instead, I was told that was preposterous and that the room had indeed been cleaned to the highest of standards. Two-hours later, someone came into the room to ""investigate"". When they saw the mess that had been left, they offered a menial apology. Still another two hours later, housekeeping arrived. The level of incompetence even extended to the valets in the parking garage. In the most incredible display of stupidity of our visit, the valet actually brought the wrong car to me. I was half tempted to take the car that was brought to me (it was certainly an incredible make and model), but my better judgment prevailed. I informed the valet of his mistake, to which he replied, ""Sorry dude, I read your ticket wrong.""

Hoping to take a nice long soak after my travels, I made my way to the bathroom. While I did find a large, deep bathtub, there was a hard water stain giving it a dingy look. Hardly what I expected for the price I paid for the accommodations. In the corner of the bathroom, I found a reminder of a pevious guest, a clump of blond hair. The maid service seemed to be lacking. Not to be deterred from enjoying my stay, I decided to watch television on the 42 inch flat screen I had been promised. Unfortunately, the battery to the remote control was dead. I called the front desk, at my wits' end, to complain about the issues, but was greeted by a desk clerk with a very sassy attitude who seemed to doubt my every word.

When we finally got up to our room, we opened the door and found someone else was already in it! Yes, the front desk clerk actually checked us into an occupied room and basically gave us a key to someone else's room. We went back to the clerk who checked us in (skipping the still present line, which got us annoyed stares from the other people waiting) and told him the problem. However, he was already helping another guest checkin and made us wait until he was done with that person before helping us. He did apologize for the mix up and then went into the back room to find out what to do. This took a *very* long time. It was a good 10-15 minutes until he came back. He said there were no more rooms available of the type we had booked and the only ones they had left were on a lower floor with no view. The hotel offered us a discount off the regular price for these, but when we got to this new room, we found out why these rooms hadn't been taken. The room was overlooking the loading dock at the back of the hotel. We briefly considered just leaving and going to another hotel, but it was late already so we just decided to make do. That was, of course, until the garbage truck came around 6am and made all sorts of noise picking up the dumpsters and dropping them back down. Then somewhere around 7:30am the delivery trucks started showing up making that beep-beep backup sound and all sorts of other noise. So much for a good night's sleep.

We chose to stay in the ""King Bed Deluxe Room"" and for an average of over three hundred dollars a night we were sorely disappointed with the accommodations. Upon entry the room looked as though it had not been cleaned thoroughly, the rug looked dirty and there were crumbs or something on the dresser. The room was size was average, and again for three hundred dollars a night we were expecting a almost suite type room. The major annoyance was how loud people were. We came in after midnight each evening and long after we went to bed we could hear people coming down the hallway yelling and running. That is totally unacceptable for a supposed high end hotel. You can expect a loud guest maybe once, but every night is ridiculous. The service was also extremely sub par. We had to wait 20 minutes at check in because the girl at the counter was too busy talking to another employee about what she was going to do after work. One day we put the no house cleaning sign on the door and a maid literally walked in on me. She completely disregarded the sign, did not even bother to knock and just unlocked the door and came right in. It scared me and I'm just glad I was not getting out of the shower or changing.

Upon arrival, the lobby seemed nice and we checked in with the clerk. Although, when we reached out hotel room, we were dissapointed in finding it to be a one-bedroom suite. My family went back down to demand another room with two queen-size beds. The clerk, after a twenty minute waiting period, was able to find us a suitable room. Upon entering, the room was noticably hot. We turned on the air conditioning, and after waiting for thirty minutes, the room remained muggy and humid. I called the front desk to complain and ask for a repair man or another room. They promised a repairman within ten minutes. 1 hour later I called again and remined them that the repairman hadn't shown up. They once again promised a speedy repair. While waiting, I discovered that our room had no soap and the towels were still damp. I called the front lobby and she said that they were sorry for the inconvenience and that there were some more one the first level, but I had to go get them. After all this trouble, I argued that they should bring it up to me, but in the end, I wound up going to get it myself.

I wanted a hotel that was conveniently located to all the downtown sites, and the Conrad Chicago does not disappoint in that respect. However, everything else about this hotel could be classified as sub-par, ranging from the rudeness of the check-in clerks to the roaches that were freely roaming in my room. This hotel does not deserve to be on anyone's recommended list. My first problem was a rude desk clerk who checked me in. After asking for three forms of identification (most places only ask for a driver's license) and asking me twenty questions about the reason for my trip to Chicago, she reluctantly gave me a room key. I asked if there was a bell cap to help me with my bags and she said if I wanted to wait, one would be able to help in about 15 minutes. I didn't feel like waiting, so I dragged my bags to the room, only to find that the room key did not work!

I finally flagged down someone from the housekeeping staff to let me into my room, but I immediately saw there were problems. Two roaches scampered across the carpet and when I went into the bathroom, there were no towels or wash cloths. I went to turn on the TV and it didn't work. One of the lamps was missing a light bulb. I couldn't believe that this was happening to me. I was at the Conrad Chicago, not the Motel Six! I then sat down on the bed and the mattress was soft and lumpy. I was ready to cry.

I called down to the front desk and asked for another room, but they refused, saying I had gotten a special rate and it did not allow room changes. I insisted that they give me towels, fix the TV, put a light bulb in the lamp and have someone spray to get rid of the roaches.

After looking at several hotels in the ""Magnificent Mile"" territory of downtown Chicago we selected the Conrad. The Conrad's website impressed us immediately. The pictures of the rooms were lovely, they promised what was supposed to be a world class spa and several amenities such as huge flat screen televisions, not that we were planning to watch much tv. We called to make reservations and after navigating a ridiculous automated phone system, I was greeted by a rather irritated sounding young woman who couldn't figure out how I was unable to make my reservations via the automated system. In any case I picked the deluxe king-size bed room for two nights in mid September. My wife oohed and aaahed over the picture of the room online, most impressed with the view. It cost a pretty penny, more than I would normally spend on out of town accomidations, but her happiness was worth it. Unfortunately her happiness was short lived after arrival at the Conrad. Valet parking was a breeze but they accidentally grabbed my wife's purse when unloading the luggage. We spent an hour in panic before a bellhop finally located it. At the front desk they were pleasant but adamant that we had reserved a room with two double beds via the automated phone system.

Even with a King bed, they only figure in one person to their cost. The beds were average and although there was much to do, everything cost an arm or a leg. It was unbelievable how much they charge for everything and to see people paying it like it was normal blew me away. All in all for the amount of money that I was paying on a per night basis, if I was in Chicago for any longer than that one night, I definitely would have stayed somewhere else. I guess you live and you learn, its just a shame that I had to learn with such a high bill for very average accommodations.",0,0,murk_n103

When I checked in to the hotel, I had to wait at the desk for over ten minutes with no line. I was greeted with no ""thank you for your patience,"" or anything similar. The room was fine, but nothing too glamorous or outstanding. The internet cost $14.95/day which is outrageous considering the price of the hotel itself. The thing that pushed me over the edge, however, was the valet parking. When I wanted my car in the morning, I had to wait 15 minutes to be acknowledged (the valets were talking to each other and ignoring me altogether).

While the staff of the hotel was quite friendly and helpful and the location ideal for a night out in the city, the accommodations themselves were not up to our expectations. For starters, we requested a non-smoking room which we did receive. However, the hallway leading up to our room had a distinctive smell of smoke which certainly was a turn off for both of us. While the room was certainly adequate, the bathroom light had a distinct flicker and there was no complementary shampoo included. While the latter may seem like a minor offense, it is not what one expects from hotel of such reported quality. Finally, the cost of parking seemed to be somewhat inflated even for Chicago's standards.

We specifically reserved a non-smoking king room and paid the price for that reservation. Upon arrival, the hotel did not have any non-smoking rooms available and the representative at the check in desk was not helpful. As we had no other options, we accepted a smoking room with two queen beds. I can live with the bed situation but I truly feel that having to accept a room infused with cigarette smoke is completely wrong! There wasn't an area in the room where I did not feel nauseous from the stale smell and I cannot help but think that this smell followed me around all day after check out. To add insult to injury, the hotel staff was not sympathetic to our situation -- something I think they should be specifically trained to do -- and did not offer any compensation, partial refund or related ""perk"" to make up for our great inconvenience. Two staff members actually acted as if I was the inconvenience in asking them if there was anything they could do! Although we paid for the breakfast package, we were eager to leave immediately in the morning and dined elsewhere at our additional expense. Pardon the pun, but we just could not sit there and dine in the morning with such a bad taste in our mouth from the hotel's lack of customer service! I am hoping the corporate office responds to our complaints but, thus far, we have received no satisfaction. Needless to say, we will not be visiting this property again!

After a half hour, I finally received the correct room. The linens on the bed were of a very cheap quality, they were scratchy and had a musty smell. Also, the bathroom wasn't cleaned properly as there was still trash in the waste basket (including a condom) and there was no shampoo. Also, I had a coffee pot in the room but no coffee.

When we checked in, we lugged all of our luggage upstairs to our room to find that someone was already in it. We then returned to Lobby, and to our dismay, the hotel had Double Booked the room! After another 30 minutes of haggling and whatnot we were able to be moved to a ""better"" room. The bed was unbearable, the shower looked like it hadnt been cleaned properly and the room smelled of cigarrettes (although it was supposedly a non-smoking room). Too tired and jet lagged to complain we went to sleep. However, it was hard for us to do so because voices could be heard all thoughout the night due to the paper thin walls of the room.

After all this hassle I would normally expect at least a complimentary beverage but not only was that not offered I found even using internet at this location involved a rather exorbitant fee 13.95 for a 24 hour period.

I was shown my room and at first glance everything seemed fine with the room. As i was settling into the room, I began to notice a general lack of cleanliness. I noticed spiderwebs in corners, and a lack of cleanliness in the bathroom. Also, it was advertised that there was an i pod docking station in the room, however, it did not work and I had to call down for them to bring a replacement. I, as a guest should not have had to call down, these items should be checked to ensure they work properly before a guest checks in. I found the restaurants on site to be crowded, loud and not to mention an unusally long wait to be served my meal. I did inquire about a few of the menu items and my waiter seemed to have a lack of knowledge about the menu items.

mturk,"I recently stayed at the Fairmont Chicago Millennium Park hotel, and it was one of the absolute worse travel experiences that I ever had. One of the main reasons why I had originally booked my stay at the Fairmont was because the property offered special, ""pure"" rooms and suites that are supposed to be hypoallergenic. Because I suffer from extreme allergies -- and I really hate the thought of a less-than-pristine hotel room -- I was happy to pay extra for a room that was supposed to be specially designed for guests with environmental sensitivities. I'll tell you this right now -- save your money. When I got to my room, I immediately detected the distinct smells of cigarette smoke and mold. To add to the gross factor, I took a look around and noticed dust on the lamps and light fixtures as well as dirt on the carpet. The comforter on the bed looked messy as well -- as if someone had recently used the bed and then hastily threw the comforter back over it. There was no way I was going to stay in this room, so I made my way back to the check-in desk and politely informed them of the problems with my room. The woman at the front desk told me there were no other rooms available and it was only after we practically got into a yelling match that she grudgingly started typing away at her computer. After making me wait for another twenty minutes, she finally informed me that they could put me in another room, but it would be a four hour wait. Four hours! It was absolutely ridiculous. No hotel -- much less one that constantly touts some sort of promise of superior customer service -- should ever treat any of its customers this way.

The clerk at the front desk twas texting on her cell phone! How rude! We were totally on time and the manager said that they would take care of the issue and upgrade our room but it was not done. And after waiting that long for the room, can you believe it? There was a dirty towel in the bathroom. The television didn't work, we had to wait on a repair guy to fix it. Plus, the hotel failed to mention there was a convention that was going on and the spa was under repair. I'm so mad I'm writing the owners and letting them know! This really made me mad. We haven't taken a vacation in years and I was expecting the Fairmont to be luxurious and cater to our needs. Even the concierge snickered at my boots, so what, I like to wear Doc Martens!

Finally I was given the key to my non-smoking room away from the vending area. Much to my chagrin my room was right next to the vending area and I heard other guests going back and forth to the ice machine until nearly midnight. And the room was obviously a room for smokers. The blankets on the bed and the pillows reaked of cigarette smoke. I, of course complained, but was told that was the only room available as they had booked every room for a conference but I was welcome to check out and go to another hotel. After a fitfull night's sleep I awoke to children running up and down the hallway. Their parents were no where in sight. My shower was cold and had no pressure.

This was my first trip to Chicago and I had no idea what to expect and this hotel came recommended by a colleague so I had high expectations. Check-in took a bit longer than I would have liked as they were experiencing computer problems and the staff at the front desk had to call their main reservation line to confirm reservations. Once I did get into my room, there was a strong cigarette odor in spite of the fact that it was a non-smoking room. I went down to the front desk and requested a room change. Given their computer problems, that took almost an hour and the staff was quite surly and didn't have the ""positive attitude in spite of any difficulty"" I'd expect from such a high profile establishment. The new room was not a suite as I had originally booked but it was significantly fresher smelling. When I hooked up my laptop, I was dismayed to discover that there was no wi-fi service. I had made my reservation online to take advantage of their free wi-fi for online ressies, but as part of their computer problems, the wi-fi service was down. Fortunately, there was a Starbucks up the street with available wi-fi. Granted, I couldn't lounge at the Starbucks in my jammies like I could in my hotel room, but connectivity for work is necessary so we make sacrifices. I was determined not to let computer problems color my opinion of the hotel as it's not something that is necessarily under the control of local management. However, the hair in the bathroom sink and the wet washcloth that was on the floor behind the toilet are definitely under the control of local management. A quick call to housekeeping got a promise to give the room a once over while I was down the street at Starbucks. They did as promised and when I arrived back at the room there were no stray bits of previous customer's DNA and the dust bunny population had been eradicated. Once I had a chance to relax in the room, there were a few minor details that stood out. The carpet was starting to get worn in places, the edges on some of the furniture was dinged, and my personal pet peeve... the inside of the drawers were rough, unfinished wood which I dislike as the little splinters can cause runs in my clothes. I would have expected higher quality furniture for such a hotel. But, all things considered, my stay was tolerable. Water pressure was good and it was quiet enough at night to get decent sleep.

mturk,"A few weeks ago we stayed at the Hard Rock Hotel in Chicago. The hotel was a bust from the get go. As we arrived in the lobby, we had to wait several minutes for the front desk clerk to show up. (We could hear her talking in the back for 5 minutes.) When she got to the desk she was very short with us and not very helpful. We had to wander around the halls looking for our room. Once we got to our room, we thought the weekend was going to get better. The rooms are modern and nicely designed. That was about all that this hotel had going for it though. As soon as we started to explore the room more, it was clear this room had been a haven for a party a few nights before. The bathroom smelled of vomit and the bath tub had small shards or glass from broken bottles in it. We called a worker and they cleaned most of it up, but the thought of it still remained. As we all settled down to sleep, there were a few loud noises coming from the room next door. After about an hour, we finally made a call to the front desk to complain. The woman said that a rock band was in that room and they had just finished a show in Chicago. They were staying there the next 2 nights. I wouldn't recommend this hotel to anyone! It's a hard rock hotel all right. (At least that's what the beds feel like!)",0,0,murk_n138

I have to say, normally I am very easy going about amenities, cleanliness, and the like...however our experience at the Hilton was so awful I am taking the time to actually write this review. Truly, DO NOT stay at this hotel. When we arrived in our room, it was clear that the carpet hadn't been vacuumed. I figuered, ""okay, it's just the carpet."" Until I saw the bathroom! Although the bathroom had all the superficial indicators of housekeeping having recently cleaned (i.e., a paper band across the toilet, paper caps on the drinking glasses, etc., it was clear that no ACTUAL cleaning took place. There was a spot (probably urine!) on the toilet seat and, I kid you not, the remnants of a lip-smudge on the glass. I know people who have worked many years in the hotel industry and they always warned that lazy housekeeping will make things ""appear"" clean but in fact they make no effort to keep things sanitary. Well, the Hilton was proof. I called downstairs and complained, and they sent up a chambermaid hours later. Frankly, I found the room disgusting. The hotel itself, outside the rooms, was cavernous and unwelcoming, with an awful echo in the lobby area that created a migraine-inducing din. Rarely have I been so eager to leave a place as this. When I got home, I washed all my clothes whether I had worn them or not, such was the skeeviness of our accomodations. Please, do yourself a favor and stay at a CLEAN hotel.",0,0,murk_n140

Once I finally got checked in and located my room, I discovered that neither of my room keys worked and had to make my way back to the front desk. Finally I made it into my room. It appeared nice enough until I went to use the bathroom and found the toilet clogged. The manager moved me into a new room, so I can't complain too much, but still it was a hassle.

I didn't want to be difficult. In the following days of my stay, it got a little harder to ignore all the minor problems that were making the Hilton very undeserving of the term, luxury hotel.

I'm am very paranoid about hotels being dirty, so I pulled back the sheets and moved all the pillows around and noticed several more hairs.

It was watery and had no flavor and it was not cheap! Our server seemed annoyed when we complained and did not offer it to be taken off the check.

We were expecting some minutia of luxury. However, this was not the case with the Hilton Chicago. First, we had reserved a room with a king size bed, but they did not have any available and we were stuck with a queen size bed. Now, we did get a reduced price because of this, but we had made a reservations and expected to be accommodated as we had asked. Second, we had to change our room key twice. The room keys they used supposedly lost their ""charge"". This is what the front desk told us. So, we had to go up to our room, find out the key didn't work, then come back down stairs get a new key, then get back in. This was highly unprofessional, and they really need to look into their key system. Lastly, we were told at the end of our stay that we had no charges on our room. We knew this was accurate, but I always check just in case. But two weeks later when I checked my credit card an additional two hundred dollars of charges were on my card. I had to call and argue with them for twenty minutes before they took it off my card. Suffice it to say we will not be staying there again.",0,0,murk_n145
mturk,"For a hotel rated with four diamonds by AAA, one would think the Hilton Chicago would be almost like staying at a palace with royalty. The only royal thing about this hotel however is that it was a royal nightmare. I should have known from the moment I walked in with my wife that this was going to become a bigger headache than what it was worth. First off, as soon as we arrived to check in at the hotel with the clerk who couldn't be any older than nineteen or twenty, red flags started going up. The clerk was extremely rude and lazy, acting like it was a chore even getting up from texting on his cell phone. If that wasn't bad enough, the clerk pretty much ignored me while blatantly staring at my wife's breasts. She wasn't even wearing anything that could be considered skimpy as it was cold out and she was wearing a turtle neck sweater under a large fur lined coat. After diverting his atention several times we finally got our room keys. It shouldn't have been any surprise when we learned that there were no one to help us with our luggage as the clerk said they were all out on break. Okay, that was annoying, but we managed easy enough. We finally got to the third floor where our suite had been reserved for over a month and we looked forward to resting after our long trip. To our surprise, not to mention our disgust and horror, their was already a couple in what was supposed to be our room on the bed making out. It took almost a half hour between the couple in the room, the front desk, and my wife and me to get it straightened out. Apparently the night clerk didn't bother following policy as they had taken our reservation off the computer to give to their friends while leaving the printed card for the day clerk. After what could only be described as chaos, we were finally given another room on the next floor up. We were thankful when we got to it and my wife went to use the bathroom while I dropped our luggage by the beds. Hearing a clinking sound I bent down to look what one of the bags could have hit to see an empty beer bottle sticking out from under the bed. I was about to call back down to give the clerk a piece of my mind when I heard my wife cry out. There on the wall of the bathroom were several roaches crawling around and I noticed something else in the sink that almost made us leave then and there. There, in the sink and in very plain sight, was a used condom! So far we were less than thrilled about being there and we stomred back downstairs and demanded our money back. By then the desk manager had returned from where ever she went off to and talked us into taking another room, free of charge to make up for our troubles. The room itself was thankfully clean with no bugs and no trash or any other disgusting items laying around. Despite being a lot smaller and not having the promised view that our other room should have had, we decided to make due. So while my wife went to get cleaned up after our long trip I pulled my laptop out to use the so called high speed internet access. I shouldn't have even bothered as I've used dial up that went at least three times as fast as the speeds I was getting. With a quick call to the desk I was informed the person responsible for the internet was gone for the day and there was nothing that could be done for the moment. So instead of worrying about it, we went to get something to eat from the the onsite dinning area. Yet again we were met with rude people who either stared at my wife's chest or forgot half of our order. After arguing with them for what seemed like forever over not getting everything, we found that our found was not only bland, it was cold! We didn't even bother trying anything else, that was the final straw so we got our things and found another hotel. I don't know who would hire a bunch or rude employees who was barely out of high school or who couldn't clean a room, but I know that that hotel didn't deserve four diamonds unless it was in the negative.

Lacking any form of fitness center, the Hilton is almost alone among the major hotels of Chicago in forcing its patrons to go elsewhere for a quick workout.

The hotel staff refused to believe me, but did let me change rooms to one that didn't smell of cigarettes. However, I might as well have stayed in the first room. I was short towels, and it took four calls(over a period of 12 hours) to the front desk to get some. The sheets had not been changed, made obvious by the crumbs and fresh stains that littered them. Yes, I was able to get fresh sheets, but like the towels, it took several hours for them to be delivered. Since this is a pet friendly hotel, lucky me I got stuck in the room next to the room filled with yappy little dogs. The walls were so paper thin, all I could hear all night was barking. When I complained about it, the staff refused to believe me, and said that the walls of the room are so thick I shouldn't be able to hear anything from next door. Yeah right.

I'm not sure if management intentionally hires rude people or if the poisonous culture inside the hotel grinds otherwise decent people into cynical pulp. The bellboy scowled at me in the lobby, was rough with my luggage, and then scowled at me again when I tipped him $5. Likewise, the receptionist seemed flustered and in over her head. She had to call her supervisor over *twice* just to check me in, and I had a reservation! Apparently she was new, and didn't have much experience using the computer, but that's no excuse: it turned what would have been a two-minute process at a decent hotel into 15 minutes of tedium. Sadly, the room was no better than the service. The hot water in the sink did not work, the shower was only lukewarm, and one of the bulbs was dead in the light fixture above the sink. Complimentary mood lighting, I guess. The TV was a bust; sure it was an LCD, but the ESPN logo at the bottom right corner of the screen was burned in and stayed there on every channel. And to top it all off, the bed smelled funny. I called the front desk (at least the phone worked), and asked for fresh sheets. The person I talked to said they'd be right up, but never came.

I wish I would have saved my money and went somewhere else. With a hotel this expensive, you think that they might throw in some bonuses your way, like complimentary parking. Not a chance. In addition to the $259 price tag, I also had to pay $30 for parking, per night. If I had stayed at the Motel 6, parking would have been free. The staff there were not very nice at all. When I registered, the lady at the counter acted like helping me was interfering with her internet chat time. She was very rude to me. Perhaps she was having a bad day or something, but I doubt it. After I arrived in my room, my key card didn't work, and I had to go back downstairs to get it fixed (once again, interrupting her precious free time with some actual work). The rooms had some nice features, like kitchen appliances and a flat screen television. I didn't go on vacation to cook though. The television didn't get very many channels, and you had to pay if you wanted to watch any of their movies (of course). I tried logging into Facebook to say hello to my friends from the hotel room, but the ""complimentary"" internet access was so slow that it was hardly worth using. I get a better connection at Starbucks. They offer a complimentary dinner and breakfast, but it's nothing to write home about. I've had better food at McDonald's. The food was pretty cold, and the choices are very limited. Traffic around the hotel was hideous. This hotel is downtown, and you can definitely tell. There are a bunch of one-way streets around, which makes getting in and out confusing. The room was pretty clean, but you can say that about a lot of hotels in a wide variety of price ranges.

The management apologized but did not offer any sort of compensation for our inconvenience. Once the suite was ready, it was nice. But then we quickly discovered that there was no hot water in our bathroom. We were relocated to another room with apologies, but again, no offer of compensation for the trouble. Once we were finally settled, the free welcome dinner reception had wine and beer. The food was okay, but we were so frazzled from the issues we had checking in that anything would have tasted good at that point. The staff suggested their complementary grocery shopping service. We though it was a good idea since we were already so tired. Unfortunately, it took them three hours to finally deliver the groceries to our suite and the bill was far more than we expected.

Also, the carpets didn't seem fresh and even had high traffic dirt noticable. I also visited their small gym/workout area and was disappointed there also. It had limited equipment that was in poor repair. The floor in there was even slippery, which made it a definite trip hazard. While the indoor pool looked good, as I dipped into it, the water felt a bit slimy and did not have a good smell.

It should have been ready hours earlier, but perhaps the inclement weather that had delayed my flight had also delayed the hotel staff. In any event, I was advised to wait in the bar, creatively named BIG Bar.

I waited there for over an hour before checking back in at the front desk. Was my room ready yet? 'What room?' they replied. To my astonishment, it seemed that I no longer had a reservation! How this came to pass, I do not know, and the boy behind the desk was certainly unable to enlighten me. I explained that I was simply waiting for my room to be cleaned, or furnished, or renovated, or whatever they were doing to make it ready, but my words were nothing against those of the almighty computer, who spake ""Guest Not Found"" or some nonsense and who had the final say in such matters. I requested the manager, who was unavailable, presumably because the staff had not yet managed to get him ready either.

The waiter was annoying and in your face when he could clearly see we were not ready to have our food taken yet. When he finally came with the check we thought ""our light supper"" was all too pricey. Then we were supposed to meet the sales manager Erin in the Lobby at 8:00 PM sharp. Not sharp enough. At 8:15 a worker came over to us and stated that Erin had an emergency and wouldn't be able to meet with us tonight. Well that is just great.

My receptionist had made the reservation and the room should have already been on or company account but they were insisting that I supply a personal credit card for the room. I understand their precautions but I travel a lot and usually do not encounter this situation. Once that was all taken care of (several phone calls later) I was taken up to my room. It was nice and I was glad to finally be there, but the bell hope was very short with me and was very quick to throw out his hand asking for a tip, even though he had done nothing but groaned the entire time he was taking me to my room.

The room itself was a nightmare. It smelled like an ashtray and it was very clear that the bedding was in dire need of replacement. There was also a huge problem with my television, in that it would automatically turn itself off every 15 minutes or so. I complained about these problems, but very little was done. The hotel staff eventually did bring me new sheets, but the quality was only marginally improved. Overall I was very disappointed with my stay at the InterContinental Hotel in Chicago.

So, I expect to get my money's worth. Unfortunately that was not the case at the InterContinental. Firstly, my room was surprisingly small and unclean and could probably use a renovation and an upgrade in the furniture. Again, this is supposed to be a luxury hotel, and it's expensive. I shouldn't be worried about why the carpet and other parts of the room seem dirty. I also had trouble getting the room to the temperature I wanted. I'm not sure if there was just a problem with the air condition in my room or if it's a problem in the whole hotel. The building is old and I suppose it has a lot of problems from being old. Secondly, I was disappointed with the quality of the service from the hotel's staff. I thought they were somewhat rude and inattentive. Thirdly, this hotel has a lot of additional expenses. I felt like they wanted to overcharge me every chance they got (use of the fitness amenities, internet, etc). When I'm already paying so much for a hotel room, I get very irritated when I feel I'm being nickel-and-dimed every chance they get.

The clerk mixed up our rooms and when I pointed this out he got really snooty with me. We get to our room and the maid hadn't cleaned it yet! We had to wait around for that, so we went to the hotel's restaurant and the food was terrible and overpriced. Finally our room is finished and the the ""view"" we were promised was non-existent.

We had to carry our luggage up to our room ourselves as the hotel was in the middle of a shift change. This seems like something a supposedly ""world class"" hotel should be able to avoid. The good: Our room did have a nice view and when I sat down on the bed it was like sitting on a cloud. The shower was very pleasant. The bad: The room was very small and the bed was not the King size we had requested. We felt very cramped and uncomfortable throughout our stay. We have stayed at less luxurious hotels that were much more spacious and able to provide us with the requested size bed. The restaurant options were acceptable, although the service was not as excellent as described. Perhaps we expected a miracle that would've changed our minds about the hotel. We were so disappointed by the room and the service at check-in the rest of the weekend was somewhat tainted.

It was getting late, and we had no place to go, there weren't any hotels nearby and my kids were starving. I asked if there was anything he could do, and he said that I will have to ask someone else because he was busy. I talked with his manager and after a bit of fussing, the manager apologized and moved us into a room for the night.

Man oh man, were we disappointed. The check in was smooth enough even though the hotel was busy and all seemed well. We got ready to go out shopping and went to visit the concierge in the lobby to ask about suggestions and bargains. There were six people in line for her and we had to wait. That was no problem since we weren't on a timetable. When we finally got to her and asked about shopping on the Miracle Mile, she just pointed to the door and said, ""It's right out the door."" I asked her for suggestions of the best stores for bargains and she rolled her eyes at me saying, ""there's no such thing."" I couldn't believe her abruptness. We left the concierge stand not wanting to return. Shopping went well and was fun. We returned to our room and wanted to look up a restaurant for the night ourselves rather than ask the concierge. We couldn't find a hotel directory in the room. I called the Housekeeping Department and was told, ""we're all out of directories here in the office."" I asked if they could check a vacant room for one. She said the hotel was full and there were no vacant rooms. I hung up and thought I would just look for a restaurant in the yellow pages. Guess what? You guessed it, no phone book in the room. I figured we could go get a drink at The Bar, the hotel's 20's themed lounge, and ask the bartender for suggestions. We went to The Bar and there were only three other customers. We sat at the bar and got our drinks. As I was about to ask the bartender for restaurant suggestions, his cell phone rang. He answered it and went to the other end of the bar to talk. Twenty minutes later, he was still on the phone. Tired and hungry, my wife and I went back to our room and ordered a pizza to be delivered from Pizza Hut.

Gorgeous chairs, staff at the desk focusing on their job, and a clean, well decorated hotel room. Much to my, and my wallet's dismay I found quite the opposite. I arrived to the hotel late after my flight was delayed, and found the clerk reading a magazine. It must have been a fascinating article, as it took him a full minute to look up and ask if I had a reservation, or would be making one. I said I had one, and gave him the voucher I'd printed out. He checked it, and said that all the single rooms had already been rented out, he went on to say that I would have to pay extra for a two or three person room if I wished to stay the night. I grudgingly accepted the two person option as the jet lag was setting in and I desperately needed to get some sleep. The clerk offered to walk me to my room, saying I looked tired and trying to navigate the hotel would be much easier after I got some sleep. I accepted, and followed him to my new room. He carried the briefcase I had with me, but it was not apparent why at the time as I had both hands free. He ushered me into my room, setting the briefcase down inside, and said if I needed anything that the phone next to the bed would give me a direct line to room service without having to dial anything. I thanked him and closed the door. It was then that I looked around and fully saw where I was staying. What was supposedly a two person suite was two twin beds 6"" apart, covered in ruffled blankets and sheets. The cleaning staff had obviously not been in here recently. A quick look around the other areas and I found the bathroom was out of toilet paper and soap, not even the complementary ones were left behind. I got ready for bed, and looked around for the TV remote, which it turned out, had no batteries in it. Instead, I just turned out the lights and rolled over, sheets and blanket turned inside out to try and find a cleaner option. In the morning I walked down to the lobby and asked to check out. I'd had enough of the hotel after one night. The clerk that morning was a cheerful blond who cheerfully asked me my room number and handed me a bill. $240 for my room, and an extra $80 with a note about a baggage service. I asked her about it, and she said if anyone carried my bags to my room for me it was filed under the baggage service. I asked if it was considered reasonable to charge $80 for carrying a suitcase to a room two floors up, and riding the elevator, and she said it was unusual, but not unheard of. She offered to change it to a ""mere"" $20 and handed me a slip with a phone number, name, and reason for the disagreement, saying that the manager would handle any complaints between the clerk and I after I signed it.

My room was bland and colorless, in spite of The James' boasts of their attention to design and detail. The room was mostly clean, but after seeing the stains on the bedding, I am not convinced that they were washed after the room's last occupant. I attended a stressful business meeting in The Dining Room that night, complete with cold and undercooked food served by sloppy, disgruntled waitstaff. Afterward I decided that a relaxing spa treatment was in order. I was assured that I would enjoy ""Asha's Purifying Shower Ritual"", which would primarily take place in my own room. The shower was okay, but I think I must be allergic to the jojoba oil provided, because I broke out in hives all over my body. Next came the ""in-room"" portion. While I was in the shower, five of the foulest smelling candles had been lit in my room. I guess they were supposed to make it smell good, but I began choking on the odor the minute I walked in the room.

We had to wait for an hour for the house keeping service to prepare a new room for us. The room had an odd smell and we had to ask for towels and hand soap as they weren't already in the room.

I lived in Illinois during college, and as I was on a college budget, most of my trips up to the city involved sharing a room at one of the cheaper hotels away from downtown. For my visit back, I decided I would treat myself to a nicer stay than I was used to, so I booked a room at the Knickerbocker. Everything looked nice when I got there, but for the price I paid, I was really expecting something far above and beyond what I got. Maybe I wasn't dressed right, or didn't carry the right luggage, but the front desk clerk was unnecessarily snooty when I checked in. Shouldn't a hotel try to make its guests feel welcome? When I stayed at the cheap hotels in college, the front desk employees were always friendly when I checked in and out, and they would give me good tips on the best way to get to the fun things in the city. Here, I didn't even want to ask for any tips at the front desk because I didn't want to deal with the eye rolling and ""too important to be bothered"" attitude I got when I checked in. I guess the location was more convenient than the hotels I used to visit, but I really thought that part of the money I was spending on a nice hotel would pay for a pleasant customer service experience. Look, obviously I can afford to stay at your hotel, I already booked and paid for the room. Even if customer service isn't your number one goal, making money should be pretty high up on the list, and making a paying customer feel unwelcome isn't a very good way to secure return business.

A used coffee filter was left in the coffee pot for me to clean out. I am not sure my sheets were changed out.

Now, first, being from rural midwest I was surprised at the price in general, but kind of accepted it when I was assured by my cousin(whom I was visiting in Chicago) said it was normal. So I check in, service seems fine. I get checked in, room seems ok. A couple of hours later, a lady comes into my room, not a hotel employee, just some lady. Turns out, they cross checked the rooms. We(her and I) went down and complained. Turns out they double booked the room, not that they were full, but they were full on THAT room type, Standard, as well as the Superior Rooms. Rather than simply upgrade one of us for the mistake they asked which one of us would like to ""move up"". We argued with them for 20 minutes, they didn't budge, our only option was for one of us to fork over an extra $60 for a Corner Superior. We(the lady, her name was Sharon) decided to split the difference some, she gave me $20 and I moved. I get to the new room about 20 minutes later, nobody, but Sharon helped me move. I get there, the bed was thrown together, not made, and the bathroom wasn't clean, the garbage had a kleenex in it(I wasn't going to check if it was used). I called down, it was now 5PM. No answer, I called for 10 minutes and finally got a hold of someone. I told them about the state of my room. They said they would have someone up ""right away"". I waited 30 minutes and a lady comes in, not in uniform, but she did a hell of a job cleaning. She switched out the garbage, wiped out the whole bathroom, vaccuumed around me, and switched out the bedding, all told she was in and out in 10 minutes.

Also, My Wife is a light sleeper and the trains kept her up at night. Another thing is alot of ads boast a hot tub in all the rooms but this is not true, our room only had a normal tub.

With a hotel that markets itself as ""luxury,"" we were expecting to get a big bang for our buck. We were disappointed, to say the least. First of all, we stayed in the King Deluxe room and it was uncomfortably small. The space was used poorly - my wife and I could not walk around the bed at the same time because there was so little space. The decor seemed rather dated and not of the best quality. Although they said our room woudl be ready at 3, we had to wait almost an hour past that for our room to be ready. Although the staff did offer a complimentary drink as an apology, they didn't seem terribly upset or apologetic about the inconvenience this caused. The noise at night from the city is horrible - even with the radio on in our room we could hear traffic and pedestrians on the street well past midnight. The hotel would not move us to a different room. All in all, I felt that we paid $100.00 for a luxury hotel and got a $40 Motel 6. We will definitely not be back anytime soon.",0,0,murk_n274

It was two rooms, not as spacious as I would have liked, an entertainment room, and a bedroom with a standard television. Can You imagine, I was expecting H.D., but it was just ordinary cable. For $600 a night you would expect a 42 inch set. The bath was ordinary, nothing special, but the bed was a very big King.The view did not take in the Lake, unfortunately, just the Magic Mile. Well, I am starving so time to eat. The restaurant was well appointed, I hope the food was as good. I ordered lamb chops, potatoes au gratin and mint sauce. It was fair.

That person was preoccupied with something on their computer so our presence was not acknowledged for several minutes. Then when we got to our room, there were beautiful drapes in the window and across one entire wall but I found them to be incredibly dusty.

My room was adequate, but nowhere near what I've seen elsewhere at this price point. Recent renovation must be slang for ""everything is stiff and smells of industrial adhesive."" The mattress in my room was incredibly firm, and I slept poorly. When I travel, I expect an experience similar to or better than my experience at home.

Unfortunately, and I think I speak for both of us, we were not fully satisfied with the hotel. The hotel advertises luxury-level accommodations, and while the rooms resemble what one can see in the pictures, the service is certainly sub-par. When one plans a stay at such an establishment, they expect a service that goes beyond having fresh towels in the bathroom when they check in. First of all, the air-conditioning in the room seemed to be in need of a new filter and when it was first turned on, the air coming out seemed musty. Second of all, the fitness center was only open until 10:30 pm. For people who like to exercise after dinner, this can certainly be a problem.

My company had arranged for me to stay at the Omni Chicago Hotel located in the center of the Magnificent Mile. Once I arrived at the hotel and gave it the once over, I was pleased but not impressed. Once I put down by luggage and inquired about my reservation. I was told that my room was not ready yet and that there'd be an hour delay. I tried not to lose my temper and pleasantly asked if I could have another room. I was told there was a convention going on in the hotel and every room was filled. I would have left, but my company had a account at this hotel. If I stayed somewhere else, I'd have to pay out of pocket. The service employee behind the counter flippantly told me to take a seat and went back to talking with his gum-chewing co-worker. I picked up my luggage and plopped down in a cushy chair that wobbled. The leg in front on the left side was broken. I picked up my luggage and moved to another chair. Two hours passed by before I was given my room. When I walked into the room the first thing I smelled was cigarette smoke. I was mad because I explicitly asked for a ""non-smoking"" room. I was furious. I didn't feel like going back downstairs and dealing with the idiot behind the counter and I was tried from my long flight. I sighed, tipped the bellboy and slammed the door to my room. I thought maybe I could use the air conditioning to freshen the room. When I went to turn it on, it didn't work.

We requested a non-smoking room, but it had obviously been smoked in before, as you could still smell the stale smoke in the air. In fact, we were told that the entire hotel was supposed to be non-smoking, but the hallway smelled like cigarettes as well. To top it off, room service brought us the wrong item. When we checked out, we saw that they still tried to chage us for the item, even after we sent it back. I would also have to point out that Michigan Avenue is a bad spot for a hotel that claims to be so high class. Right outside of our hotel were drug dealers and prostitutes. I couldn't even go to the gas station after 8 p.m. because I was too scared to leave the hotel. The pool was closed on our first night there because of some convention that the hotel was holding, thus keeping us from using the hot tub that we were looking forward to.

They insisted on escorting me to to my room, every time I came in, like I was going to break into another guest's room or something. I swear, anytime I was out of my room they were watching me like hawks, asking me if I needed anything. You know that the only time anyone does that is when they think you're up to something. I went to the pool, but it was full of screaming children. When I went to bed, I could hear the television in the next room through my wall. And what's worse, they wouldn't even let me smoke in the privacy of my room to relieve the stress. They threatened to throw me out on the street, after I gave them hundreds of my hard earned dollars! I had to go outside-- probably where the dog went to piddle-- to do it. Also, their on-site restaurant is too expensive, given that you're already paying an arm and a leg for the room.

The hotel looked elegant online but included information that also indicated it was child friendly. At the check in the staff was cold and seemed quite annoyed by son who was merely saying hi and asking the name of the person helping us. One elevator was broken we had a long wait for other elevator. The hallway appeared a bit dirty as we made our way to our room. The room was decent. Not deluxe as their website indicated it would be but is was comfortable and the view was good. We had a long day of sight seeing and play on Saturday. As my son was tired, we elected to return to our room and have room service for dinner. There was no children's menu for room service. Only for the restaurant from which the room service came from the same kitchen, what??? We ordered an adult meal. The food arrived an hour later, cold and unappealing. But we at it because we couldn't wait another hour. Although the hotel looks lovely. The service was not very good. Most of the staff was cold and snooty. Except for the cleaning staff who were very nice. It might be ok for a couple or business traveler but do not stay with children. A comfortable motel might be better.",0,0,murk_n311
mturk,Upon entering my hotel room at The Palmer House Hilton I immediately turned my nose up at a foul odor coming from the bathroom. After placing my bags on a poorly made bed I walked into the bathroom to find the last visitor had failed to flush the toilet. I immediately called room service and asked for a new room. They apologetically told me there were no other rooms available but would send someone right up to handle the mess. After oh around a half hour of waiting a very angry maid knocked at my door. She seemed very irritated to have to deal with the mess and looked at me as if I should have been the one dealing with it. After the room was cleaned up she turned to me as if asking for a tip. I hesitated and she angrily stormed out of the room. I thought things would run smoother and tried to relax with an ipod. Yes you can use your ipod in the room however what they fail to mention is the constant white noise because the signals are so poor. And nothing could compare to the remote control heating and air. When I was able to get the buttons on the remote to work the temperature seemed to change on its own. If I wanted hot air it would slowly get colder and vise versa. After giving up on a nice television program I decided to retire to bed. Egyptian sheets? Right! All I can say is I found myself early to check out and in a new hotel within the next hour. If you value your back do not rent a room from this hotel.,0,0,murk_n312

The cleaning staff was still there when we arrived at our room and they made us wait outside while they were still cleaning! Now, granted it was only 15 minutes and sometimes guests can be messy but I thought that was the only weird thing I would have to put up with on that trip. It wasn't! They charged us for a mini-bar fee when we don't even drink, no one told us that we would have to pay for liquor anyway! They also did not get our wake-up calls to us on time, so we missed our tour bus and almost a whole day of our trip. We had to spend $50 extra bucks on cab fees just so we could see the city in the way we'd planned! And then it wasn't as good because the tour guide wasn't there and we got lost!

I had requested a room with 2 queen size beds on a lower floor and was not given that. The air conditioning in my room was not functioning properly and it could not be turned off. The room had an overpowering fragrance smell which made my sinuses act up. I wondered what had happened in the room before I got it to make the housekeeping staff use so much air freshener. There was no doorman available or a cart so I had to lug my 3 suitcases by myself by dragging 2 of them about 20 feet and then going to get the other one so as not to lose sight of them at any point since they contained valuable irreplaceable items. Luckily another guest saw my predicament and offered assistance. My room had evidence of the previous occupants that had been left behind and overlooked by the housekeeping staff. They promised to send someone up to take care of the debris and after 3 calls to the front desk I finally gave up. I had looked forward to my stay there but have to conclude that it simply did not live up to the advertising and was a poor value for the money that I spent to stay there.,0,0,murk_n316

The baggage handlers gave me rude service and when checking in or out, they almost just refuse to provide service. The room I stayed in was ill maintained and looked like nothing like in the pictures. The windows were dirty and I couldn't see anything outside the window.

For the price I was paying, you'd think they'd allow access to the work out facilities, but they wanted an outrageous PER DAY charge! Top it off with the small pool and no hot tub and you won't want to be spending any time here at all. To top it off, the promised discount rate wasn't honored at the end of my stay, despite being assured that all was well at check in! I ended up arguing with the manager about it when I was checking out - since I had to catch a flight, no resolution happened and as of yet, I'm still waiting for responses to my calls and letters.

mturk,"I recently stayed at the Sheraton Chicago Hotel. It was my first time staying at this hotel and, I am sorry to say, it was my last time staying there. One of my main issues with this hotel was the amount of noise. The walls must be very thin because lying in bed at night I could hear my neighbors in the next room talking. Although I could not quite make out the words of their conversations, I could definitely hear their voices as more than just a murmer. In addition, I was awakened several times by people conversing in the hallway as they walked by my door, presumably on the way to their rooms. Admittedly, I am a light sleeper, but this was ridiculous. If you decide to stay here, I suggest that you check your bill very carefully before check out. When I checked mine, I found that I was being charged a rate higher than the one that I was supposed to be charged. I had to wait in line at the front desk for someone to help me (and the front desk service is woefully slow) and finally had to ask to speak to a supervisor before the error could be corrected. Finally, though I had been told upon check-in that my room had been recently updated, I cannot believe that statement was accurate.

Once at the hotel we quickly found out that there was not ample parking. We drove around several times looking for a space and had to park in an adjoining lot and walk across a busy side street to gain access to the hotel. Upon checking in we were informed that the floor, where our room was located, was in the process of having the carpets cleaned. We decided since we prepaid with our credit card that we were going to make the best of the situation. We took the elevator, which smelled like urine, up to our room. We did see some carpet cleaning machines, unattended, in the hallway. I hoped for the sake of safety, no children were staying on this floor. We walked into our room and my first thought was how much humidity was in the room and it seems one of the guest used the microwave to heat up some sort of spicy curry cusine. The overwhelming scent of burnt curry mixed with the chemical smell of the carpet shampoo were too much for us. We called the desk manager and asked if we could change rooms. He rudely informed us that the hotel was completely booked due to several weddings. Just then, the roar of the carpet cleaning machine came through the walls and I could not hear anything else my husband said. We decided to get a refund on our card and leave the hotel.

I arrived late at night and had one peaceful dreamy nights sleep before being woke up at dawn. I reserved a room on one of the lower floors unaware of the construction happening in the area. I complained that I had not been informed of the construction and requested another room. My complaint was totally disregarded. I was told there were no other rooms in the whole hotel available. When I explained that the noise was bothersome I was treated rudely. The woman at the front desk actually ask me if I thought she could make the workers stop. I understand that the staff has no control over the noise. They did however know about the construction. Information I did not have at the time I booked. Information that would have swayed my decision. Then to treat me so rudely for bringing it to their attention. I will not be staying there again.,0,0,murk_n348
mturk,"The Sofitel Chicago Water Tower in the downtown area is advertised as a four-star luxury hotel. However, modern architecture and a convenient location seem to be its only reliable perks. Room service is available 24 hours a day, but offers a limited variety of items and often lethargic service. Two bars are located on the premises, which is appealing at first. Once inside, patrons do not receive the quality of service that is to be expected and there is a complete absence of privacy, of any kind. The guest rooms are relatively spacious and clean, but a lack of adequate toiletries and personal items can interfere with a guests routine. Obtaining additional towels and grooming products is much too difficult. If you are a traveler who is in search of a relaxing and hassle-free experience, with reliable customer service, booking a room here is probably not a viable option.",0,0,murk_n349

Upon entering the building, you can easily see that it is clean and high class. The lobby was nice, and everything seemed as it should be. However, as soon as I made it into my room, it was completely different than everything previous to it. It was dirty, visible yellow stains on the walls and all around the restroom. The room too was not completely organized as all other hotel rooms I've been to. There was also a lingering smell from the last tenants. When I called the front desk about these issues, they sent someone up to fix it. I left the hotel about two hours and upon returning, they were still at it! This is an unreasonable amount of time to fix these glaring errors. The smell also did not completely disappear when they were done. As I was too tired, I just decided to deal with it for the rest of my stay here and focus on enjoying my vacation at Chicago instead.

I asked to have a room near the top floors and my room was actually only on the fifth floor! The desk clerk was less than helpful to fix this. I eventually got it fixed but I certainly did not feel at all like a valued guest during this process. Later when I went down to ask for directions and information at the desk the clerk was very cold and abrupt with us. The room was quite nice but the shower did not deliver adequate water pressure.

We hadn't gone to Chicago before to be tourists and were looking forward to the view which was offered. Unfortunately, when we got to our room, the view was disappointing. We had requested a non-smoking room and were assigned to one, but it was obvious to us that someone had smoked in there. I am asthmatic and became very ill. We asked to be moved to another room, but were told there were no other rooms (even downgrades) available. Nothing was done to try to make up for this. Because of my health, my husband and I checked out within hours of arriving for our romantic anniversary weekend. This is not how I had imagined spending such a special time.

After much inappropriate arguing, they found our reservation and we were assured all would be fine. When we checked in we got a dirty room without any working wifi or TV. It took a few calls to get fresh towels and for them to turn the heat on so we could sleep comfortably. The next day we called to get our complimentary room service that most decent hotels provide free and they had no records of us even checking in. A quick check with the credit card company had they charge already pending in the wrong amount. We finally left in disgust and got a much better hotel, the FancyPants Hotel and Suits with complementary airport shuttle and award winning preferred member rewards club. Overall, the service at the Sofitel was rude, rooms were unsatisfactory, restaurant sub-par, not well kept up or clean.

The customer service is poor unless you look like you have $50 to tip someone. The furniture throughout the establishment looks and feels like it cane from Ikea.

He did finally give me a room at the rate that I had been promised, but did not offer any compensatory discount or bonuses for my inconvenience. The room itself smelled of dog but was otherwise okay. Not worth the rate though. The website really makes this hotel seem upscale, clean, and well decorated, but the rooms are not in the style that you would expect from the lobby.

I handed over my booking confirmation and she told me that at first she had spelled my name wrong, even though I had spelled it out for her. She then proceeded to tell me that due to a conference, all of the executive suites had already been allocated, but that they would be happy to assign me to a lake view room. Correct me if I am wrong, but this is a step down from the room I had asked for! Surely if you give away my room, you should try to compensate me with something better! I said that no, I really needed more space as I would be using the room as an office, and finally she said that they did have a corner king room available, and that if I wanted to switch the following evening, I would be welcome to do that. The room was ok, although, again, I was disappointed by how cold and clinical it felt. I did attempt to make use of some of the hotel services, but found them sadly lacking. Some comments on the services: the high speed wireless was not available in the room unless you were willing to pay a fee for a cable to connect, and also a per day fee which borders on extortion! There was free wifi in the lobby, but requires you to sit near the doors which open constantly letting in freezing blasts of air, plus deal with the noise and bustle of people constantly coming in and out. I did phone room service on my arrival to request an extra pillow and towels, but had to wait 2 hours before they arrived.

We had mentioned to the reservationist when booking that this was to be a romantic weekend getaway for us - it was our anniversary. We asked for, and were promised, a king room. However, when we checked in, we were told by the front desk clerk that no king rooms were available. We could either take a double queen room, or pay significantly more for a suite. We took the key for our double queen room and were on our way. Upon arriving on our floor, we found a rowdy group of young girls running up and down the hallway, squealing and playing. It turns out that this hotel offers American Girl visits for the nearby store. It turns out that our romantic getaway room was in the center of a block of rooms reserved for a Girl Scout troop on an American Girl trip! We went back downstairs to request a move to another room, and were told no other double queen rooms were currently available. We explained that we were here for our anniversary, and the ambiance wasn't exactly what we were looking for. The clerk rolled her eyes and told us that she couldn't help us - they didn't have anything else. Sorry. Back upstairs we went. Tired from travel, we decided to order from room service for dinner. Our pasta, when it arrived, was barely warm and mediocre in flavor. We ate it anyway and prepared for bed. After using the bathroom, we discovered that the toilet in our room continued to cycle water after flushing. After jiggling the handle a few times and poking around in the tank, we couldn't get the water to stop running. It took three hours for a maintenance staff member to make their way up to our room to fix the problem. The next morning, after showering, I discovered the hair dryer didn't work properly. After pulling my wet hair back in a clip, we went out for the day. Upon our return, we expected to find our room made up and fresh. It hadn't been touched. We called downstairs to have someone sent up to clean it, but by the time we'd left for dinner, nobody had arrived. Our room wasn't made up that day. That night, the Girl Scouts sat in the hallway giggling and singing until well after 1am. We asked them several times to be quiet, but they didn't want to listen, and their chaperones were nowhere to be seen. We called down to the desk, and they told us ""they would take care of it"", but the girls continued to have their party in the hallway anyway. Nobody came to shoo them away. The next morning, I turned on the hairdryer, expecting it to work after reporting the difficulty the day before. It didn't! Stuck wearing my clip again, we checked out and made a mental note to select another hotel in the area for our next trip. This hotel had potential, but the staff doesn't care enough about your experience to allow me to recommend it to other travelers.",0,0,murk_n382
mturk,"I recently stayed in a room at the trendy Talbott Hotel. It looked nice on the outside so I decided to them a whirl. As soon as I walked in I noticed that there weren't alot of hotel employees. Usually, the large hotel are swarming with service people ready to lend a hand. I was tired and I needed a nice room so as I approached the front desk I noticed something odd. Food was sitting out right in front of the front desk. People were talking different items such as bagels and muffins from the left over breakfast rush. Crumbs everywhere especially where I was suppose to exchange cash and room keys. Let's just say it wasn't professional. The room was average and the bathroom didn't carry the kinds of brands I would have liked to see. No Wi-Fi connection and I had to walk down the hall for ice. Talk about lack of customer service. All in all, the stay was sub-par and nothing special.",0,0,murk_n383

The sheets smelled funny when I arrived and were only changed 6 times during my two-week stay. The room service was very slow and the cleaning crew did not replace my soap, but I did notice the contents of the mini-bar diminished every time the maid service had been in my room.",0,0,murk_n384
mturk,The Talbott Hotel is a place to stay where the staff treat you like you are not welcome. If you do not pay higher prices you are snubbed and the rooms are no classier or fancier than a standard motel. The room service takes over an hour and there is constant traffic and construction outside. The cost is far more than the luxury. The best thing about staying at this hotel are the bathroom towels.,0,0,murk_n385
mturk,"For a hotel that touts its luxury location in Chicago the Talbot is very poor (think Motel 6 at a Hilton price). Carpet is threadbare and the walls are paper thin. They are so worried about the mini-bar they constantly do these random room checks, so privacy and sleeping in are unheard of. For the prices they charge ($350.average price for two people). It seems like the money spent on remodeling the exquisite lobby, which was happening while I stayed, could have been better spent on better insulation and more up-to-date furnishings for the guest rooms. But I guess the Talbot is more concerned with first impressions than they are returning guests, which I won't be.",0,0,murk_n386
mturk,My daughter's broken heart My daughter loves American Girl and for her birthday wanted to go to American Girl Doll in Chicago. For six months my eight year old counted day the day until we left for Chicago when she could have the experience of a lifetime. We arrived at the Talbot Hotel where we had reserved the American Doll Girl package only to find out that they had given our room away and that they were going to move us across town. If that wasn't bad enough we had to spend an hour to find out if the American Girl carriage ride had been canceled or if we should book another one. My daughter sulked for most of the trip as we spent more time going from thing to thing instead of being able to walk. My daughter cried herself to sleep the first night and I could tell that her heart was broken.,0,0,murk_n387

When I first arrived to check in, the woman at the desk was very impolite and looked rather bored. It took her over 5 minutes to even find my reservation in the computer system! And I won't go into detail about how she messed up with my room keys and had to give me a second set! When I finally got to my room, the first thing I noticed was that it smelled stale. The air in the room literally smelled like it had been in that room, without any fresh air, for years. I soon discovered my bathroom toilet had a leak, as well, and every time you flushed the toilet, water would trickle out from the base onto the floor. Talk about concerning. I reported this to the desk, and the fellow who answered promised someone would be up right away to fix it. No one showed up until the next day, and very early in the morning, I might add. Later, I called room service and asked for a bottle of wine. It took them half an hour to deliver it to my room! And it wasn't even chilled by the time it showed up, either; it was lukewarm. Overall, my experience here was not very pleasant, and I don't recommend booking with this hotel.",0,0,murk_n388

The Talbott Hotel website claims to have ""opulent accommodations, impeccable service, and unexpected delights."" The last time I checked, ""opulent"" had a bit of a different meaning than ""easily outdone by the senile 90-year-old landlord of your college apartment,"" ""impeccable"" wasn't code for ""rude and unfriendly,"" and ""unexpected delights"" were more fun than a faint but obvious stain on your sheets at a hotel. Overall, my stay here simply wasn't worth the money or the hassle involved in making the correct reservations. For a lot less,I could have been treated rudely and had a mediocre stay in a more casual environment.",0,0,murk_n389
mturk,"WARNING! My stay at the Talbott Hotel will go down in history as one of my worst experiences staying in hotels. I was excited for a weekend getaway with a few friends. After receiving a few positive recommendations and looking at their website we decided to stay at the Talbott. They were promoting up to $30 breakfast credit per day. And breakfast is my favorite meal so this was already looking like a great time. Upon our arrival we were greeted by an employee (which we wouldn't have known had he not told us) that was not only rude but made sexual advances at one of the ladies on our group. Once we talked with a manager about the incident outside he assured us that he would take care of the issue and even upgraded us to King suites instead of the double size rooms we originally reserved. If someone had blindfolded me and took me into one of these rooms I would have sworn we were at Motel 6, not a luxury hotel in Chicago. The linens were stained, room smelled of smoke and had another odor that was similar to old cat pee. I was truly disgusted. After a night out on the town we came back to our disgusting rooms to get some sleep. The next morning I was excited for our breakfast that was highly recommended by the hotel and other guests. I have to say it was one of the worst breakfasts I have ever eaten. The toast was stale, eggs were made from powder instead of real eggs, and the juice they served was sour. I would never recommend this as a place to stay. I would suggest the Red Roof Inn over this place anytime.",0,0,murk_n390

I thought it would be a special treat to take my 13 year old daughter to spend a weekend with mom, shopping and enjoying a bit of Chicago's exciting night life. I found The Talbott Hotel's website and decided The American Girl Package they offer was what I was looking for. The price sounded reasonable, so I booked a room. The two of us were so very excited to spend some time together. We arrived at the hotel to check-in at 5:00 on that Friday afternoon. After making us wait for 15 minutes while trying to find my reservation they informed me the room wouldn't be available for another hour. They blamed this on shortage of maids that day. They did manage to find us a table in one of their cafe's but this wasn't a good start to our special weekend. When we were finally allowed to go to our room we found that the doll-sized travel bed that is included in the package wasn't in the room. This disappointed my daughter, she was looking forward to that. While they did find a bed and bring it to us it just wasn't the surprise we had imagined. The rest of the weekend went by fairly smoothly. We managed to have a good time together even though the service wasn't quite what is claimed on the website. Would I go to the Talbott Hotel again? Probably not.",0,0,murk_n391

When I went to check in I was told I didn't have a reservation, knowing my credit card was charged I argued with the guy who was working. Finally the only option he gave me was to speak with someone else. Thankfully they knew how to use the computer. I go up to my room and there was a terrible smell of beer and feet. I could not believe it when I complained, I was told to spray some air freshener. I had to go visit family. When I got back my room key did not work. Once again there I was complaining to the helpless employee. He told me the magnetic strip must of came in contact with a magnet. I could not believe the mentality of this guy. I had one more night reserved, I could not take it anymore and I went and spent the rest of my vacation at my Aunts house. I would not recommend The Talbott to anyone.",0,0,murk_n392

To start off, I was NOT pleased. For the hundreds I pay a day, I expected an impeccable hotel. First, the check-in process was bad as somehow it took them nearly 15 minutes to find a reservation I had placed nearly A MONTH in advance. Some customer service they claim. Next, when I went to my room, I found that room service had not cleaned it at all. I was forced to wait as they called up a maid to entirely reclean the room as it was strewn with used towels and such. In summary: yes, it was a fancy hotel, yes it had nice accommodations, but the service I experienced there was simply not up to par with a hotel of that price.",0,0,murk_n393

After spending several minutes frustratingly navigating The Talbott Hotel's website, I FINALLY was able to complete a reservation for a long weekend. After a long flight into Chicago, we were so ready to check in, shower, and lay down in our hotel room. However, once we arrived the unfriendly clerk behind the counter notified us that we did not have a reservation. I provided her with the confirmation email and she again said there must be a mistake because the room we reserved was already occupied. She begrudgingly found us a new room after what seemed like an hour of waiting. We then carried our own bags up to our room only to immediately be hit with a rancid smell of cigarette smoke as soon as we opened the door.

Room service left a lot to be desired. The food took forever to arrive and when it did it was cold and unappetizing. The staff at the hotel was not very helpful and was very unfriendly. Had no toilet paper in room. Room was very noisy. Could hear people next door opening doors, watching tv, talking. The room was very dingy, small and had a musty odor.

The clerk could have been nicer about the whole situation, and told us simply that ""we would have to wait"" without offering any sort of help with our luggage or a timetable for when our room would be ready. When we finally arrived in the room, the sheets were not clean. A call to housekeeping proved difficult, as I do not speak Spanish. The second day of our trip, housekeeping never showed to clean the room despite the presence of our ""please service"" sign hung on the door. We stayed in for some room service after a long afternoon on Michigan Ave. When the food finally arrived a full hour after placing our order, it was cold and not very good.

After staying there and experiencing the service, environment, and the hotel in general, I can say with confidence that this just isn't true. I arrived with rather high expectations due to the claims made by the hotel and some of the reviews posted on their website and I was immediately disappointed. No one came to my car to collect my bags and I was forced to lug them inside myself. The doorman was polite but failed to even open the door for me, leaving me to fend for myself while trying to carry my bags. Once inside, the atmosphere was not what I expected. The lighting was poor, leaving the lobby dark and it looked like a dingy setting with a glossy veneer in an attempt to hide the degenerate state of the building. The carpet looked dirty, as if it hadn't been vacuumed or washed in quite some time, and up in the corners where the walls met the ceilings there was visible water damage. When I arrived at the front desk, I was forced to wait over five minutes until someone came out to help me. After checking in I went up to my room and was once again disappointed. The bed was very uncomfortable and I ran the shower for ten minutes without ever receiving any hot water. That night I ordered room service. The food took 45 minutes to get to my room, and when it finally arrived it was cold. The fitness center had a very small selection of machines which caused long lines while waiting to use them.

I knew this would be a positive experience from day one when I actually booked our reservations, the staff was very knowledgeable and courteous, and the whole process was quick, easy, and painless. Upon actually checking in the day of our honeymoon, the customer service was there again the staff again made us feel at home and at ease. The rooms were beautiful and the spa service is excellent.

mturk,"The Hotel Allegro in Chicago is understated luxury. I love the minimalist decor, and the linens were quality and exquisite. You can't beat the location, either, it's located in the heart of the theatre district. Walking distance to all the great restaurants in Chicago! They also offer an in-room spa service, which is pure decadence. I chose to indulge in the Eucalyptus Mani/pedi. It was by far the priciest manicure and pedicure I have had in my life (135 dollars) but it was a wonderful experience. The eucalyptus treatments left my hands and feet feeling so soft yet refreshed at the same time. I highly recommend this hotel if you want to experience the finer thingsthis gorgeous city has to offer.",1,0,murk_p26

But in the end I did, because the hotel is situated in such a great area, that I had to go out and see some of the sites. This hotel has wonderful rooms and service, and is in a really great area.

I took a taxi straight from the airport and was greeted at the door by a kind gentlemen who offered to help me with my luggage and assisted me to the check-in counter. I made my way up to my room, which was spectacularly bright and well-lit, then I ordered some food. All in all the food was delicious and the staff were fantastic.

It was visiting time visiting Chicago for the first time on a business trip and a friend referred me to the Hotel Allegro. He said they were pet friendly,which was a huge plus. This is because I hate leaving my kitten muffin with a pet sitter every time I travel for business. Upon my arrival, I was met with friendly valet who treated me like I was the only customer who mattered. I walked in and saw a hotel like no other I have seen before or after. The lobby was decorated with modern furniture and paintings and looked like a place I could relax in. After I had entered and checked in, I saw the staircase, which looked like a testament to the staircase in the ""Titanic"". Frankly, I was amazed and I had not even entered my room yet. My room was a Queen Deluxe room and it was amazing. The bed had a blue headboard,which I have never seen before, and the colors worked together so well I seriously contemplated living there. The room service was exceptional and promptly brought the food I ordered. Later I wanted to get a drink and I enjoyed it at The Bar 312, which is conveniently located adjacent to the hotel. These are the specifics of my stay, but there is much more to be experienced that I did not mention if you visit the Hotel Allegro. In summary, they allow pets, the service is amazing, the decoration superb, and it is conveniently situated next to dining establishments. What more could a person ask for?",1,0,murk_p30
mturk,"I went here with the family, including our dog Marley(They are very pet friendly). We really enjoyed it. This place is huge with over 480 rooms and suites and is in the center of downtown close to shopping and entertainment.

I searched many hotel websites looking for the perfect hotel to spend our honeymoon, and Hotel Allegro seemed like the right choice. Soon as I walked into to their elaborate lobby area, it was like I was a big shot on Wallstreet, the service was excellent and the best part, they allow animals. They treated my little dog Johnny like he was royalty. They have everything you could ever need in a hotel, from in room spa service to a workout center. They even made sure that I had all of my drinks and amentites ready for the Monday night Bears game. If I were to give have to rate it from a 1 - 10. Id have to give it a 10 many times over.

The rooms were gorgeous, well taken care of, clean, comfortable, well decorated and luxurious. The hotel also has a spa which was perfect because we didn't even have to leave the hotel for our relaxing spa day. The hotel has great staff, they were always attentive to our needs.

Upon arrival, the service at the front desk and the bellman was fantastic! They treated me as if I stayed there all the time! The rooms were cozy, with very comfortable beds that helped me sleep through my jet lag. I ordered breakfast the next morning, and had room service bring it up. The meal was brought up only a few minutes after ordering, and was delicious! I would recommend these accommodations for anyone traveling, or any families staying in Chicago, as the rooms were very reasonably priced, and is a short distance to lots of great sites. Next time I come through Chicago, I will definitely be staying here!",1,0,murk_p34
mturk,"I have to admit, I was a little leery about visiting Chicago due to my mild agoraphobia, but after a family member reserved a room at the Hotel Allegro Chicago, my fears were slightly assuaged. A few friends of mine had stayed in this hotel before, and had nothing but positive things to say. With this new-found optimism in mind, I went forward on my journey in confidence. I have to say, I was not let down. From the moment I stepped into the lobby, I felt at home. The concierge called bellboys to move our luggage from the taxi to our rooms, and the check-in process was fast and efficient. The rooms themselves are incredibly homey, feeling less like a hotel room and more like the guest room at a millionaire's mansion. The high comfort level coupled with prompt service when requesting items such as extra pillows and towels, really helped alleviate my apprehensions about staying in Chicago, and provided a secure place to stay at night, or whenever I did not feel like participating with the group. Of course, the rooms are second only to the overall feel of the hotel. I found myself spending less of my downtime in my room and more of it wandering around the building. Overall it's very cozy, and has a certain old-world feeling to it, once again lending to it feeling less like a hotel and more like a mansion at times. It was never overwhelmingly crowded, and the people I did encounter were incredibly friendly, yet not intrusive. I don't usually enjoy staying in hotels, but I love the Allegro Chicago!",1,0,murk_p35

We were very impressed with the overall setup of the hotel; the lobby, dining areas, and rooms all had a special touch of class that made our weekend exciting and full of luxury. The decor of our room was very modern and eclectic with hues of blue and white, and lighting that complimented and set the mood.

To say the rooms at this beautifully renovated hotel are stylish is an understatement. I stayed in one of the more moderately priced rooms yet found all the amenities of premium rooms at other hotels. My room was spacious and furnished in a retro-modern style. A fully stocked refreshment center, wet bar, and LCD HD TV were amongst the standard items. The Allegro is in the center of everything, the Chicago Loop of the financial district, the Chicago Theatre district, great shopping on Slate Street and fine dinning is available adjacent to the hotel (I suggest the 312 Lunch Club). The fitness room is well equipped and clean. The professional and friendly service was the icing on the cake during my stay at the Allegro.

They really treat you like a VIP and are there to help with any questions you might have. The rooms are so beautifully decorated that you wish you could hire their designer to do your home. In my room I had access to my own personal dvd and cd collection. Did I say IN the room? I didn't even have to leave or order something on the television. It was nice to shower with their AVEDA products and get into my microfiber robe and slippers that they supplied me. While staying in for the night I was also able to use my laptop in my room since they have wifi throughout the hotel.The bed was very comfortable and everything was so clean! In the morning I was treated to a great complimentary breakfast and ordered a massage. Yes...ordered. They came to my room and I didn't even have to leave. Very comfy! This hotel was by far the best that I have stayed in and I travel a lot for business so I would know.You always have high expectations when you're staying at hotels and I'm pleased to say that my expectations were far exceeded.

Extremely comfortable King sized bed, dual head shower, breathtakingly beautiful views of the city, I couldn't ask for more. After a great nights sleep we awoke to a great FREE breakfast right outside our room! Next we enjoyed a couple's massage and I was treated to a facial as my fiance took a short run through the city.

At $200.00 per night, you can expect the very best from your staff, and your accomodations. When I arrived for my weekend stay, I was greeted by a pleasant surprise of wall art, and eclectic style. After reaching my room, I was able to relax in peace on the numerous pillows. I didn't choose to use the spa this trip, but when I come back, it will be the first item on my list! The business office was great, because I had a last minute emergency with work- thank goodness for cocktail hour. Breakfast was delicious.

mturk,"Last weekend my wife and i decided to take a weekend trip to Chicago. When looking for a hotel we weren't all that interested in price, but more of a relaxing getaway in the heart of downtown. I did some research and and came across the Amalfi Hotel Chicago. What sparked my interest was it's location and the fact that they offer in room spa treatments. Located in Chicago's river north area, it is close to the magnificent mile so we can get all of our shopping done while staying relatively close to the hotel and also do some sightseeing along the chicago river on one of many chicago boat tours, both of which were fantastic! After a long day out on the town we came back to the hotel to induldge in their in room spa treatments. My wife got the whole works (facial, manicure and pedicure, and hot stone massage therapy), while i enjoyed a deep tissue massage to get rid of some of the pain from walking around all day! For dinner we went downstairs and enjoyed a fabulous dinner at Harry Caray's Italian Steakhouse. Best steak I've ever had, hands down. When we were finished with dinner we just wanted to go back to our room and relax so we hopped into our comfortable king size bed, put in a movie with their in room dvd players and beautiful 32 inch HDTV's. For anyone looking for a nice relaxing getaway to the great city of Chicago, I would recommend The Amalfi Hotel Chicago to anyone. They offer anything you could ever want in a luxury hotel plus more.",1,0,murk_p50

mturk,"I recently stayed at the Amalfi Chicago with my wife on a business trip. We decided to combine business with pleasure and made a long weekend out of our stay after business was concluded. We enjoyed the luxurious in-room spa service and stayed in the superb one bedroom suite with incomparable views of the surrounding city. The individualized attention from check-in to reservations was exceptional and better than what we usually receive from concierge service. The Amalfi actually delivered what they promised and more. Our weekend was more relaxing and enjoyable due to the excellent training of the staff and the amenities offered on site. The hotel's design is modern and sophisticated with the decor being a delight to the senses. Lots of color and clean lines made a great impression and felt both modern and comfortable. Breakfast is served on each floor or in room and my wife especially appreciated the availability of the fresh fruit and yogurt. Being of European descent, I enjoyed the croissants, whole grain muffins, real butter and marmalade. We also brought along our Standard Poodle, Sterling, and the Amalfi is one of the few luxury hotels that allow for pet accommodations and understand that your pet is part of the family. We purchased the pet pamper package and this allowed Sterling to have his days while we had ours and we reunited in the evenings. Sterling slept in our room as usual at the foot of our bed and this contributed to our feeling ""at home"" while away. For pet lovers this is a big plus. Finally, transportation to and from our corporate jet was arranged with ease by the hotel so we did not bring an assistant with us on this trip to handle these arrangements as is normal. This allowed us a bit more privacy and it is scarce for us to be able to do this, another appreciated bonus of our stay. Thank you Amalfi for a superb experience.",1,0,murk_p53

The hotel is super clean and very chic; the beds are so comfortable and the staff is superb. We were able to bring along our dog, which was also really important to us. The first day we were there, we had gone out during the day with our dog and came back to an in-room couple's massage. The masseuses come straight to your room so it's really relaxing and stress-relieving and they were great. After our massages, we went to the Keefer Steakhouse, which the hotel gave us a gift certificate for and the food was fantastic. They do also have a great continental breakfast and we did also eat at the Rocket grill, which was nice as well. In all, our 3 nights there were pretty similar, we went out during the day and had a great time at the hotel while we were there; I've recommended this place to a few of my clients going to the Windy City.",1,0,murk_p54

After staying at the Amalfi Hotel I may never stay in a regular motel again! Right off the bat instead of a 40 foot counter with snooty workers or kids that started two days ago they have individual desks for check in with people that *gasp* have a clue as to what they are doing. We got the steakhouse package deal at the on-site Keefer's Steakhouse restaurant the food was the highest quality and cooked to perfection. The room was spacious had robes and slippers, a stocked mini-bar, The mattress was comfy, and the whole room was clean. The staff was amazing and had no problems bringing extra towels and pillows for my wife. In the morning the continental breakfast was served on each floor instead of herding into the lobby which I loved cause I love breakfast but not crowds. Unfortunately for me the hotel was close to a lot of shopping, my wife was in heaven however, and we spent a large portion of the day on the magnificent mile attempting to max out my credit cards.

It was nice and clean, with plenty of extra towels available. It was colder than we expected with the wind blowing in off the water, but the concierge knew exactly where we should go for jackets and scarves. We will definitely be staying here next time we visit Chicago. We would make the trip just to stay here. That's how welcome we felt when we stayed at this hotel.",1,0,murk_p67
mturk,"Upon arrival at the Ambassador East Hotel in Chicago, I was immediately impressed with the courtesy and attentiveness of the staff. From the moment we checked-in until we left; the staff, from the front desk to roomkeeping were extememly pleasant and accomodating. Since we had our two daughters with us, we booked the traditional double room. The room was very nice with comfortable beds and a great view too. It had plenty of room for the four of us--or should I say five of us. The girls did not want to leave home without ChiChi, our teacup Chihuahua. Fortunately, the Amabassador East allows small pets (with a pet waiver). That made everybody happy! The location is great as well. Conviently located. Easy to get to from Lakeshore Drive. Close to the museums. I'm looking forward to my next visit to Chicago. I'll be staying here again!",1,0,murk_p68

I was perfectly happy to enjoy the luxurious rooms and comfortable decor while my husband enjoyed the solace the found in the free gym. Everything was so clean and invoting. Especially The Pump Room; there was so much history in one rooom. Overall, we had a great, relaxing vacation away from the kids.

mturk,"From the moment I stepped into the Ambassador East Hotel, I was very much impressed!! The entire staff was extremely helpful and very pleasant. The bell staff escorted my husband and I right up to our suite. Our suite was beyond belief. The atmosphere was very classy and romantic. My husband previously arranged for a bottle of champagne to be waiting in our room when we arrived. We had traveled to Chicago, from New York, for a romantic weekend get away. We had dinner that night at the hotel restaurant, The Pump House, and were very pleased. Dinner started with soup and a salad, main course meal and dessert, all for a reasonable price. We did a little local shopping the next day, after a very well rested night in their wonderfully comfortable king sized beds. Every interaction with the staff was a postitive experience. We enjoyed our weekend get away and would most definitely return to the Ambassador East Hotel the next time that we are in Chicago, Illinois. 5 stars....",1,0,murk_p70

The only complaint I have is that internet access is not free. I would just like to mention one person in particular- Sofie.

My wife and I went into the city on a weekend getaway and found the Ambassador East on a hotel booking website. Their rates are very, very reasonable for the high class and luxury that they provide. I was pleased to know that they allow pets as we decided to go into the city last minute and couldn't find anyone to watch our dog for the weekend. I was more than pleased with the friendly staff and felt like their hotel put an extra emphasis on knowing their customer, which is nice because most places in Chicago are very impersonal. All in all i was very pleased with our stay and would recommend it to anyone looking for a place to stay in the downtown area. 5/5 Stars.",1,0,murk_p78

mturk,"My visit to the Conrad Chicago in the heart of downtown was a luxurious experience bar none. The lobby is immaculate and is filled with reams of class and style. The rooms are beautifully adorned. I especially like the flat screen TV and wired internet. I'm never happy with wireless connections so it is nice to find a hotel that knows that its guests need fast, reliable internet connectivity, and it's included at no additional charge. The view from the room was magnificent...downtown Chicago at night! The Restaurant is spectacular but the Terrace is the place to be when weather permits. You cannot get a more breathtaking view and be able to relax in the gentle breeze of evening while dining on the finest gourmet foods. Don't forget to visit the Health and Fitness center with their selection of aerobic and anaerobic workout equipment. The staff is attentive to your every need and the concierges can get you whatever you need. Just ask! This is the place to stay in Chicago if you want to be pampered in luxury!",1,0,murk_p84

Not only was the room beautifully decorated and very comfortable, but the food in the restaurant was exquisite. Not to mention the perfect service from the resort's employees! I was very impressed by how quick and caring the staff was of my own personal needs. I'm naturally a fitness freak, so I was pleased to learn of their massive fitness area on the 11th floor. Best of all, it was available to guests at any time, day or night. The resort was conveniently located by a large shopping area, so it wasn't a far walk to scope out the shops. The most memorable part of my stay was looking out at the city after dark and seeing how gorgeous Chicago looks all lit up. It was so relaxing just watching the city come to life. I was very disappointed when I had to pack and leave. Any time that I make my way back to Chicago, you better believe I will be staying at the Conrad Chicago.

Friends had stayed there years ago, but when we showed them our photos, they couldn't believe the amazing renovations. While we loved the modern decor and style, our main reason for choosing this hotel was because of what they call Fairmont PURE rooms. I have had so many awful allergy attacks while travelling, so I wasn't too optimistic that they could actually make a truly hypoallergenic and allergy-free room. I have to say I felt great during our entire stay. We enjoyed a delicious bottle of wine and incredible cheese and appetizers at Eno. What a treat to get such amazing food and wine without even having to walk out of the hotel. This hotel is truly beautiful, everything you would expect from a high-end, big city hotel.

Aside from the lovely city of Chicago, this hotel was just amazing! We had gotten in quite late that evening from our flight from Houston and were so tired! The staff was genuine and friendly, all while being professional and prompt. We were quickly checked in and before we knew it we were in our beautiful room. Too tired to really take it in, we were in bed and asleep in minutes. The beds were quite welcoming! It wasn't until the next morning that we were able to really take in all of the beautiful features of this hotel! It's gorgeous! Everything was so clean and wonderfully decorated! The lobby somehow didn't make it into our sleepy eyes the night before, but it was just lovely! Later that evening we decided to eat at their sushi restaurant. Sushi is one of my husband's favorites, so he tends to be picky. They passed the test according to him! We also enjoyed a glass of wine there as well... everything tasted great and was of excellent quality. Of our two night stay there, the only downfall was one occasion of there not being enough towels (I use a lot of towels I suppose). However, a simple phone called prompted a quick delivery of fluffy additional ones. This however was only a minor bump in the road to an entirely enjoyable and relaxing stay! Overall-- we'd love to go there again! Maybe next time I can talk my husband into taking advantage of the spa... *wink*",1,0,murk_p118

It was grand and I spent a total of 4 days and nights there. The luxury was exotic and the location was right around the corner from most shopping and dining venues. The room service had me drooling because the food was so delicious, I could hardly picture not feeling satisfied. I met up with a few of my friends and they offered me a tour around town. I enjoyed the stay there and will come back sooner than later.",1,0,murk_p120

I mean, I'm kind of a music person, but this was my first real experience with a musically ""themed"" hotel. Upon staying here, however, I am convinced that I made the right choice in my stay. The dining accommodations were excellent, and I was served probably some of the best food I've ever eaten at a hotel. It was intelligently placed in downtown Chicago, and I wouldn't have to walk too far to see some street performers, or just take in the majesty of the city itself. The room I had booked had an excellent view of the skyline, and I could've easily sat for hours, just marveling at the city sprawled out before me. The whole ""Hard Rock"" and musical aspect of the hotel was just the icing on the cake of my stay. If I had to stay here again, I would!",1,0,murk_p121

If you are wondering whether Hard Rock Hotels are schmaltzy or cliche, they are not. Hard Rock Hotel Chicago is modern, trendy and hip. It had an air that this was where musicians came to rock among the 40 stories, and there are details that you won't find elsewhere. For example, one interesting perk is some free iTunes downloads (I got ten) for guests. It's a fun place, hosting events such as Jack Daniel's 160th birthday.",1,0,murk_p124

The service truly is incredible. They even had a web-cam so I could check in on Rex while I was out for dinner in the evening and a friendly staff member took him for a walk when I could not make it home from a meeting the day after. The rooms really rock (pardon the pun). Nothing like the cheap plastic laminated stained carpet decor so common in other places that allow pets. The easy chair looked so good that I was almost afraid Rex would snack on it while I was out, but he seemed to like the guitar chew-toy that came with the pet package better. I would definitely recommend the Hard Rock Hotel to my friends - whether they travel with or without pets.",1,0,murk_p126

In a panic, I contacted the HRH staff and they actually had another, bigger, room available. We quickly moved our meeting in the Birdland room for the rest of the day and the meeting was a rousing success. (Birdland room is 660 sq ft.) We have a new client and so does HRH.

The bellhop had out bags into the room very fast. The room was very hip and cool. There was musical items all over the place. I really loved the Beatles art that was in my bathroom. After being in the room a few minutes, I got a call from the front desk asking me if I liked my room. They also asked me if I would be interested in things like spa treatments and or if I needed to use their business room. I needed some things shipped while I was there, which they had supplies to help me with that. After getting some work done, I called the concierge if there was some really good pizza places around. They gave me information for 3 awesome places. I left and came back after having a night out on the town. They were very understanding that I was a wee bit out of it. I had more than pizza that night if you get my drift. When I got back to my room, the bed was so comfortable. I feel right off to sleep and had a good nights sleep. In the morning I order breakfast, which was really a Philly cheese steak. They will make anything you want anytime of day. I checked out by 9am with my bags feeling rested and very relaxed.

All this made for a great night sleep. Perhaps the most impressive part of our stay at the Hard Rock Hotel was their ""Party like a Rottweiler"" package we added to our reservation. For an additional fee we were able to bring our pet and were provided with treats, toys and best of all the pet cam!

I loved this option. They also give your animals a gift bag filled with treats, food, bowls and doggy clean up bags.

I didn't have the chance to use the spa, but I could tell it was really nice and relaxing. I did go to the Base Bar a couple times for a drink, very cool atmosphere and great drinks to choose from.

The pool area is very clean and neat and you always have a towel, they never seemed to run out. The service is beyond exceptional.

The last time my family and I visited Chicago, we stayed and picked the Shedd Aquarium package. What an amazing time! The Aquarium is great, and we saved a lot of money by buying this package. I also appreciated that fact that our room had a kitchen. With two really picky children, it was so nice to be able to cook, or at least to have the option. We also enjoyed the many neat facilities in the Homewood Suites Chicago Downtown. Nice pool, great workout room, breakfast buffet and the wine and beer dinner in the evening.

The kitchen was a comfort since I could prepare a meal for myself if I wished, and the refrigerator and microwave was a must since I never finish my meals when I go out to eat. I felt more at ease here rather than the detatched feeling I have with most hotels. I would recommend staying at this hotel if you want to feel comfortable and welcome in a sophisticated atmosphere.",1,0,murk_p178

We were so relieved and the room was beautiful. The furniture in the room was actually cleaned with pure tea tree oil. It was the most comfortable stay we have ever had. On top of that my husband had to spend some time in the room working on some business, so the high speed internet they provided was very convenient.

What really impressed us about the room was how spacious it was and the stunning river front views. We were pressed for time to make dinner so decided the Bistro sounded like the best option and it turned out to be a great choice! The food was simply fabulous. After dinner we were able to try out the fitness center, which ended up making our gym at home seem inadequate.

The location was perfect, just off Michigan Avenue,on the Chicago River, so it was easy to walk down the Mag Mile and get to all of the shops without having to pay for cabs or rent a car. The hotel is right next the The Palm restaurant, and within walking distance of several places to eat, both fancy (China Grill, yum!)and affordable (Corner Bakery). The rooms have been recently remodeled and were clean and spacious. We were lucky to get a room with a good view...be sure to ask that you do not have a view of the office building next door!

mturk,"Overall, the hotel is beautiful. The service was great. All the employees were friendly and always willing to help. My room on the North end had a great view of the city and the Chicago River. The bed and big fluffy pillows were very comfortable and relaxing. The only downfalls were parking and the fitness room. Parking was a little on the pricey side and not exactly as close to the hotel as one would think it should be. The hotel itself is huge with over 1500 rooms, so you may feel like your getting your daily exercise in just walking from your room to the fitness center depending on where your room is located.",1,0,murk_p187

On arrival the staff goes into overdrive. They make you feel like you are the only guest in this huge hotel. The rooms are very big and elegantly furnished with 100 percent cotton linens. My room came equipped with flat screen tv, wi-fi and high speed internet. Room service was quite extensive and if it was not on the menu they went out of their way to accomodate you. There were also car rental on site as were restaurants, cocktail bar and a 24 hour dining room. They have state of the art conference rooms with high tech features. There is also catering and limo service. The staff is multilingual and the concierge service is very professional. All in all they will pamper you from head to toe and other parts in between. This hotel is definitely worth the price and I will definitely return not as a business traveler but as a tourist who wants to be pampered. My only regret? That I could not stay much longer.",1,0,murk_p188

I needed to do some research for work and the free Wi-Fi made this very easy. The bed was so nice and soft! Even the pillows were fluffy. I was able to put my valuables in the in-room safe. The local restaurants were amazing. I will recommend this to my friends and I am staying here again in the future.,1,0,murk_p189
mturk,"I never thought I'd be able to stay at a hotel and feel completely at home. I am a mother of two children, one of which has severe asthma and allergies. I have spent more time in hospital emergency rooms than my own living room for the past two and a half years. So when my sister was getting married in Chicago, I was extremely anxious. The front desk associate, Rosa, was wonderful. She told me that they have Allergy friendly rooms. No perfumes, no harsh cleaning chemicals, no dreaded ""industry standard"" feather pillows. I booked a room, but was still really worried. I shouldn't have been. Ethan breathed as easily in that beautiful room as he did in our own home. Maybe even a little better. They had an air purification system for our room. It smelled so fresh! While my husband took our daughter to the Big Bar for Nachos (she never stopped talking about how ""totally cool"" it was), I ordered room service for my son. The man who answered the phone was so patient and accommodating. My son has a lot of food allergies, so I was pretty much ordering off menu with specific details. That's always a little humbling, but the staff treated my order with the grace as though they did special orders all the time. I was actually able to enjoy my sister's wedding. The only problem with my stay is that it was too short. We're coming back for our first family vacation since Ethan was born. Thank you, Hyatt Regency Chicago, for making this family's visit possible and positive!!",1,0,murk_p190
mturk,My husband and I stayed at the Hyatt Regency Chicago to celebrate our ten year anniversary. We could not have picked a better locate. The price of the hotel was really affordable for a couple on a tight budget. The flat screen television and the comfortable beds were a favorite of mine. My husband loved the Stetson Steakhouse and the 24 hour stay fit gym. We really did not leave the hotel during I stay there because basically everything you need is only a walk or phone call away. If we ever travel to this area again this would be my first and only pick for a wonderful stay. This hotel gets four thumbs up from my husband and I. What a wonderful ten years celebration.,1,0,murk_p191

My suite was a perfect blend of business and comfort, equipped with Wi-Fi, a generous 37 inch television, spacious work area and two queen sized beds you sink into feeling tension ease from your body. I dined at the Stetson's Chop Shop restaurant and the meal was portioned generously and very well prepared. The staff was curtious and accommodating.

It truly says something about your company when they are willing to go the extra mile to make time away from family and friends as comfortable and as relaxing as possible for you. I was greeted by a series of smiling faces that were employed at the hotel and all were eager to help. I checked in at the amazingly lavish lobby and was escorted by hotel staff who assisted me with my bags up to my room. My room was dripping with taste. The stylish room was only made more accommodating by the amenities it offered. With a mini-bar, large flat-screen television, and an entire home office setup, I barely had to leave the room. Why would I want to with the amazing views of the lake and entire city. What an amazing experience I had and I will gladly come back.",1,0,murk_p200
mturk,"At the InterContinental Chicago, you pay for more than a room. You pay for an experience. Let me elaborate. I was a bit reluctant to pay a premium for location and amenities. Like any novice traveller to Chicago, I saw the mass glut of cheap accommodations out in the suburbs, and those were originally what I set my sights on. Price is a powerful signal, and the sheer discount of those options drew me in. But after doing a bit of research, I realised that distance does have its costs. The price of transit in the Chicagoland area isn't free. And it's far from what I'm used to. Car use is price prohibitive. (I knew that originally, which is why I wasn't going to drive.) But the sting of using the automobile (parking, congestion, toll roads, etc.) gets shoved off onto taxi fares and auto rental. So, I ultimately had to end up looking for a place well connected with mass transit. But mass transit has its costs too, which meant that staying at a focal point downtown had its advantages. That's what originally drew me to InterContinental. But InterContinental is much more than the right room at the right place. The decor of the rooms and the amenities available to the guest are unsurpassable. I was travelling on international business, so the ease with which I could transact in foreign currency was a draw. (They had a currency exchange right there on the premises.) And the fact that massages, dry cleaning, and event planning were available in-house was a huge plus. My work gets me tied up in knots. It also leaves little time for doing chores. So the ability to grab a massage while my suits were being finished was a relief for me. But, on top of all that, the event planning was what put InterContinental over the top. Being able to coordinate a comprehensive tour of Chicago while completing my business and managing my personal life was a weight off my shoulders--and something I won't forget. In the end, if you're a newcomer to Chicago staying in a time-crunch, the InterContinental is for you. The pricetag of rooming downtown can seem prohibitive, but when you factor in the convenience and savings in marginal costs, it's nothing in the end. And the InterContinental is not only price-competitive with the other downtown options, it also makes staying downtown the convenience and thrill it should be.",1,0,murk_p201

Our room was always clean when we arrived home at night, it was decorated nicely, and the beds were extremely comfortable! We ate at the hotel's restaurant Zest, and the food was great!

We had originally booked the King Guestroom but upon arrival were upgraded to the Deluxe King Guestroom by the front desk. Everyone was remarkably friendly and helpful which is something I look for and remember when I go to stay in a location again. Our room was amazing. Seriously amazing. It was so chic and I just loved the headboard over our bed. There wasn't one little spot of dust to be found. The bathroom was gorgeous and we made full use of the two bathrobes in the closet. We didn't take anything from the snack bar but it all looked delicious. We had dinner at David Burke's Primehouse. I cannot recommend the NY Ribeye more highly. It was fantastic. For dessert we had the brown butter corn cake. I've been trying to replicate that dish ever since I got home. I'm sad to say that I didn't get a chance to try any of the treatments at Spa by Asha but I definitely will make a point to on my return visit. The James Chicago made our trip to Chicago memorable.

Thankfully I don't have to search around for somewhere to stay when I travel there as I've found my favorite.,1,0,murk_p221
mturk,"This is one of the best hotels I have ever been in. I went there to see about scheduling my reception party, and was amazed at the architecture of the building, the interior design of the rooms, and the massive spacing provided for each room. Now I recommend this hotel to my associates to hold their important business meetings in the James Club, so that after the meetings, we can partake in a nice meal and drinks. Which brings me to my next point. The James has some of the BEST food I have ever eaten!!! The James Private Club, I feel was made for the elite and upper class. Very classy, very elegant. The customer service is outstanding. I recommend this hotel to anyone needing to hold a reception, business meeting, or just need to have a day at the spa. 5 stars all the way!!!",1,0,murk_p222
mturk,"I stayed in on of The James one bedroom apartments for two weeks while in Chicago visiting my daughter. The pre-arrival assistant was incredibly helpful in acquiring some necessities I forgot to pack and left them in my room for me. Later in the week I treated myself to an Asha Massage from their lengthy list of delicious spa services. Afterward I smelled wonderful and was the most relaxed I'd been in years. My room was clean and modern, yet warm and comforting with dark wood tones and lush bedding. I'll certainly be staying with them again in the future.",1,0,murk_p223
mturk,"We decided to stay at The James last weekend with our kids. We reserved the ""Family Adventurer with Paul Frank"". It's a special offer by the hotel to entice visitors to see the local museums and aquarium. We ended up receiving 2 Chicago City Passes, which ultimately paid for themselves and 4 tickets for the Chicago Children's Museum. My kids had a ball. We ended the day with a milk and cookies turn down service and a special pair of pajamas that my daughter adored. All in all, a great weekend where my kids were the focus. The adults certainly weren't forgotten since we had a great breakfast in the room the next morning.",1,0,murk_p224

For this week's vacation in Chicago, I heard several recommendations regarding lodging, but the James Chicago was mentioned most emphatically. I expected an experience of comfort, luxury and customer satisfaction, but I was pleasantly surprised by the level of innovation and forward-thinking employed by every aspect of this hotel. The design is breathtaking -- modern, clean, stylish, sexy -- and its reflected everywhere from the lobby, shops and restaurants, to the stunning guest rooms themselves. My family and I felt energized by the smartly sleek environment we were in, and were impressed at every turn by the sophisticated take on hotel decor. Far from a traditional hotel experience, this was like moving into chic, exclusive downtown apartment, and truly an upscale adventure in modern luxury living. Impressive, too, was the hotel's overall approach to its guests and its use of the world's resources. From its offer of in-room recycling to the available bicycles for guest usage, the James offers a unique perspective on its place in the world, and gently helps its guests assist in maintaining that balance with ease and elegance. It's a respect that shows through, too, in other areas: support for artistic organizations, charities and other programs of merit, as well as Chicago-centric packages compiled for guests so they can make the best of their stay, whether for a weekend, a week, or longer. The James Chicago will definitely be our choice for accommodations whenever we revisit Chicago. In fact, we may visit again solely to stay at the James!",1,0,murk_p227

I came into town for a week long business conference and was referred to the James by a friend. The crisp, clean, contemporary ambiance made me feel like I was on a relaxed vacation rather than work. It was luxury without being over the top. My room was clean, comfortable and was above all standards comfortable. In my down time I enjoyed a relaxing massage at the spa and happy hour at the ""JBar"", and I highly recommend dinner at the ""David Burke Primehouse"" The customer service from all the staff members, from front desk, to house keeping to the bartender was excellent.

When we entered the hotel we were greeted acknowledged the minute we walked through the doors, and the staff member at the front desk was extremely friendly. He met our needs in a timely manner and patiently answered our questions. The lobby was clean and the ambiance was impressive. Our room was also very clean. I could not have found a better room for those two nights of peace and quiet. The bed was comfortable, and the bedding was the type you could slip into and drift off in. It has been awhile since I have stayed at a hotel where the comforter was not scratchy or too thin. My husband actually commented that he had not seen me sleep that soundly in over a month. The bathroom was also impressive. The water pressure was not something I had to mess with to get perfect, and the heater took no time at all to warm up. Even though I had brought my own shampoo and conditioner, I did give the amenities in the bathroom a try, and like everything else they exceeded my expectations. I did not get a chance to check out the conference rooms, however, my husband had nothing but great things to say about the qualities of the facilities.

The hotel features an upscale restaurant, though it is within walking distance of many great dining establishments. There is also a full-service spa at the hotel. The most surprising thing about the James is that pets are allowed; our dog didn't have to stay at home. How cool is that? There are also lots of up-scale amenities like valet parking, 24-hour room service, 24-hour concierge, shoe shine service, and laundry/dry cleaning. The hotel is located right on the Magnificent Mile, so that location is absolutely superb. You are literally steps away from some of the best dining and shopping in the world.

At first I was reluctant that they will give us accommodations because of my pet dog, but I was surprised it turned out the other way.

We got a very reasonable price for our stay (especially since we were a AAA member), and there was plenty of perks to utilize; in-room spa treatments and an evening wine wine hour to name a few. Another thing that the kids really enjoyed was that, upon request, the staff brought us a fish in its own fishbowl for our room. How cool is that!

Anyway, the moment we got there the doormen greeted us warmly and helped get our luggage situatated. It was busy and the line was a little long, but it moved quickly. The lady at the front desk gave us a high floor when we requested one which was very good, especially since it seemed to be near full. The room was clean and spacious (especially considering it's a city hotel). We made a lot of use of the concierge, since again, it was so last minute we didn't really make any plans. He gave us some tips and also gave us a few places we should go for Chicago pizza yummy! It was also great being near the theater district, and basically in the thick of everything so we saved on cab fare. I thought the coolest thing was they brought you a goldfish in a bowl for your room! very trendy. My husband is not as easily impressed, but he was really excited about the free wine hour and the free drinks in the afternoon. Overall, really nice stay in a four star, or probably four and half star hotel!",1,0,murk_p279
mturk,"My husband and I recently traveled to Chicago on a mini vacation. We stayed at the Omni Chicago Hotel in the downtown area. This hotel is simply beautiful. From the time we walked through the front doors until the day we left, we were treated as if we were royalty. I have never been treated so well. We were greeted by staff that sincerely seemed to love their jobs. We stayed in a Superior Corner Suite. The view of the city was the most amazing thing I had ever seen. The rooms were very spacious and clean. The king size bed was extremely comfortable. The room didn't seem like we were in a hotel, it had the feeling of home. There was a separate living room area which was wonderful, my husband and I just sat there one night and stared out the window at the skyline. It was mesmerizing. We ordered room service because we had a long day of shopping, which the hotel is very convenient to a lot of great shopping. Most everything is in walking distance. The food was to die for; it was as if we were eating at a 5 star fine dining restaurant. We did manage to go down and have a few drinks in the lounge. The lounge had a classy feel to it, very relaxing yet sophisticated. We even received a massage, in our room. While we did have all the conveniences of home, such as internet and TV, we did not even think about using them, being that we just wanted to get away from our everyday lives. This was the most romantic vacation my husband and I have ever taken. I cannot express how happy we were to have stayed in this hotel. We had other options but I am so glad we decided to stay here. The rate for the room was so inexpensive for the amount of luxury we were able to experience, which the experience itself is priceless. I will definitely share my experience with anyone and everyone and recommend this hotel.",1,0,murk_p280

An in-room massage appointment will add an additional relaxing aspect to the stay. There's even an exercise kit within the room for extra convince. However, the vast fitness center is just as worthy to use, as well as the whirlpool, Jacuzzi and the indoor swimming pool. Sunbathing is an easy activity to achieve via the two rooftop sundecks. A nice aspect that isn't so common to find is the ability to have small pets stay with you in the hotel.

I am a neat freak but here you need not worry about cleanliness as they are the best at keeping the rooms tidy. Our check in was easy and fast and the staff at the hotel was very courteous and friendly. I forgot my hair dryer but thankfully, one of the many perks at this hotel, they provide one for you in your room! That's a small benefit compared to the lucious pool and dreamy massages they offer! I have never had a massage like that before! My favortie thing about the Omni is the high speed wireless internet that is available to all guests. I am able to do my work online in all areas of the hotel which saved me a lot of time as I was not at my office but still had a lot of work to get done. I also LOVED the TV they provide in the room. A big plasma with a beautiful, crisp picture! I don't even have that at home! Needless to say, I spent almost all night lounging in the comfortable bed watching movies only to fall asleep and wake up to the newspaper delivered to my hotel door in the morning!

mturk,"We stayed at the Omni Chicago Hotel recently and had a great experience! My husband and I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone visiting downtown Chicago. We are frequent travelers who are used to staying in well-maintained, luxury properties with many amenities and the Omni Chicago definitely fit the bill. First of all, the hotel is all suites. We stayed in one of the ""Premium Suites"". The accommodations were definitely luxurious, with premium bedding, very nice robes for our use, and a choice of pillows. We used the hypo-allergenic ones, but I believe you could have also chosen foam or feathers. We were pleased to find that the TV was plasma, we have found that not all hotels have upgraded to plasma and we don't wish to use one of the old-fashioned type of TVs anymore now that we are so used to plasma at home. There were actually two TVs in our suite. There were also some additional amenities that we appreciated such as high-speed internet access, a wet bar, an indoor swimming pool and two gorgeous sundecks for relaxing outside. The location was perfect as it was right in the midst of the Miracle Mile, with so much to do practically at the Omni's doorstep. I also treated myself to the Windy City Massage, which was done in the comfort and luxury of our suite. The masseuse was excellent and she used very high-quality products for my sensitive skin. It was extremely relaxing and I was so pleased to find out that I could get this at the Omni. It was easy for us to see why the Omni came so highly recommended. I also wanted to mention that the staff was very helpful and friendly, recommending several excellent area restaurants. However, we think our best meal was at the Omni's 676 Restaurant, where my husband raved about the bone-in ribeye and I had the carrot soup and the Lake Erie Silver Bass. They had an extensive wine list and we were easily able to choose wines we loved with the staff's guidance. Lastly, the hotel staff also highly recommended we visit the nearby Art Institute of Chicago, which was a highlight of our trip. We loved that there were multiple museums so close to the Omni! We will be frequent visitors at the Omni in the future, where I will definitely be getting the in-room massage again.

The beautifully red-bricked sky scraper was indeed a breath- taking sight and upon entrance, I had a felling of warmth from the very hospitable welcoming staff. I was impressed with the hotels special rates offered during prime business hours and the guest rooms ranged everything from ' The Presidential Suite to The Governors Suite '. I accepted a more humble room as I would not need to spend very much time there during the day. I did stay inside most nights and the amenities were more than satisfactory. I enjoyed the very spacious exercise room and afterwards, I would take a quick dip in the pool. I toured the hotel as my niece is planning her wedding and just so happens to live close to the hotel. The ' Chagall Ballroom ', was elegant enough for such an occasion and reeked of pure luxury. I was given very adequate maps and directions to and from as my business was conducted throughout the city. That was a life saver.

The rooms themselves are fantastic, perfect for a business person there for a stay or for a family there for recreation. The new Serenity beds that the Hilton offered were to die for! One of the most restful nights sleep i have had in years! The kids loved the Ipod docks in the rooms and my wife and I loved th fact the kids could keep their bedroom ice cold like they like it and we could keep it warmer in ours.

We had a meeting in the Clark Meeting Room, even that was nice! I wanted to take a tour of the hotel itself! I was there for about 3 days and because of how convenient the hotel was to a lot of major attractions like, Grant Park, Lake Michigan, Mag Mile which is a shopping heaven, and the Navy Pier, it never really like the normal stressed out meetings.

It wasn't just a room because it also came with high speed internet and personalized listening options which were great features for a tired traveler like me. Since I was in a hurry in my two-day stay, I didn't have time to wander around the town for food. It wasn't a problem because the hotel offered a few places to dine or simply for snacks. The good thing is that their bar and lounge opened late at night. I can assure you that they had great quality food and drinks. If you are just touring the city, the hotel is quite close to parks, museum, and a lot of shopping places. If you just need a place to stay, the view from the hotel was pretty good as well.

Also, the hotel does offer wireless in the room and this really came in handy for me to keep up with my work after my meetings. I dined at Lockwood Restaurant and Bar and the food was amazing for a hotel!

A bonus was that we did not need to feel like we must lug half our usual household with us, because things like alarm clocks, hairdryers and ironing boards were already there, electronic media even available for rent. With a comfortable bed, control over how the room felt, no need to search elsewhere for coffee and excellent room service at our beck and call, we had to remind ourselves that we had planned to leave our room to take advantage of all the Chicago culture in close proximity.

Billy and the kids and I were exhausted after the long flight from San Francisco, so it's a good thing that we found the perfect place to relax! The kids ADORED the indoor pool, Billy couldn't stop talking about the beautiful jogging path, and I even pampered myself by taking advantage of the massage therapy before the big day. The reception dinner at Shula's Steakhouse was fun and delicious. I would definitely recommend this hotel to any one who is in Chicago for an extended visit!",1,0,murk_p324

mturk,We were hungry and tired when we checked into the Chicago Sheraton. The nice clerk at the front desk got us checked in efficiently and with a warm smile. He made us dinner reservations at Shula's (giving us time to shower and change) and arranged for a bellhop to take our bags up to the room for us - what service!! We enjoyed our steaks and the bottle of wine that was recommended by the waiter at Shula's - truly a lovely meal. When we returned to our room we were delighted to find that the towels had been replenished and the bed turned down! We enjoyed the view from our room before turning in and having a very restful night's sleep in an incredibly comfortable bed.

Upon our arrival, we were immediately welcomed by the beautiful design of the first-floor lobby and the friendly demeanor of the desk and bell service staff. In seemingly no time at all we were in our clean and well-furnished room with a beautiful and peaceful view of Lake Michigan. In terms of accommodations, I have never personally stayed at a hotel that I could complement more. On our very first night, my wife took advantage of a message therapy session while I swam a few laps in the heated indoor swimming pool. We followed our time apart with a very relaxing time at the Chi bar, which had a very enlivening and laid-back atmosphere. Retiring to our rooms, I couldn't help but remark to my wife about the quality of our room and the bed in particular. I had a very comfortable night's sleep and woke up just on time thanks to a spot-on wake up call from the desk staff. After a quick bite to eat the LB Bistro, we headed out to sight-see. Overall, I can't recommend the Sheraton Chicago Hotel and Towers enough.

Their friendliness came across in a very genuine manner, not fake or forced like some employees can be. The room itself was to die for. The bedding was so soft and the room was extremely clean and well kept. I cannot speak highly enough about the quality of the mattress and bedding! Because of the mattress and bedding, I got the best three nights of sleep I've ever had. The views of downtown Chicago were absolutely amazing from my room. The way the city lights sparkled stole my heart and almost made me want to move to Chicago. The food was amazing also. I made it a point to eat at all three of the hotel's restaurants and visit the bar while I was there. My favorite restaurant of the three was Shula's Steak House.

mturk,I recently traveled up to Chicago for business and had a terrific 3 day 2 night stay at the Sofitel Chicago Water Tower in downtown. The location was perfect as it gave me easy access to Michigan Avenue and the conference center where I was doing business. My hotel room was rather nice with a very comfortable king size bed and a cozy atmosphere. I ordered room service for dinner and it came within 30 minutes so I was quite pleased with that and they serve from their own restaurant which is located downstairs. The food was extremely good and I really enjoyed not having to go out and fight the traffic to find a good place to eat. I had been really tired from my meeting earlier in the day and had no trouble going to bed on the comfortable mattress. I woke up and took a shower and the bathroom was definitely up to standard with any other quality hotel. They had all the soaps and stuff as usual and they had plenty of towels on hand as well. After shower I headed down and they had a breakfast buffet at the restaurant which was free for hotel guests. The breakfast was delicious and started my day out right.

Chicago has changed, but the Sofitel made it feel like home again... except a very plush and elegant version of home! We stayed in a Junior Suite, which had great views of the city, and room service was very attentive when we called for champagne after midnight the day we arrived. Both nights before leaving for supper, we had a cocktail in Le Bar and enjoyed talking about what we'd done during the day, and all the great memories this town has for us.

If that wasn't enough each room has a crisp 32"" LCD TV that displays TV in the most beautiful and clear way with an absolutely amazing sound system. When you finally make it out of your room, down the grand stair case you need not look further for dinner than the hotel restaurant.

Their wine list is amazing but their prices are fantastic for a hotel near the Magnificent mile. A full dinner including appetizer, main course, and dessert can be had for $45, amazing.

mturk,"I recently stayed in the Talbott Hotel in Chicago with my family of three. I absolutely loved it and will definitely return! The customer service of the staff at the front desk was fantastic. They were very helpful in helping us decide on what activities to do and what restaurants to visit during our stay. For the nights we didn't want to go out, we had room service. The food from the Hotel restaurant was so delicious and the service was very quick. I also loved their commitment to the environment. It is clear to me why they have won so many awards. Thank you Talbott for a wonderful stay!",1,0,murk_p380
mturk,"""Classy"",""Decent"" and ""Serene"". these words clearly define the totality of my stay at the talbott hotel in the heart of chicago. the hustle and bustle of the city did little to affect the conducive atmosphere for relaxation provided by this posh hotel. the lounge was so welcoming and flashes of smiles from every angle.the staff from the bell-boy to the managers were polite, helpful and responsive to my needs. the room service was classy and to cap it all the beds were just as comfortable as back home, making the talbott a home away from home. my wife and i enjoyed the t-rex experience and learnt a lot about the city of chicago and what it has got to offer. believe me we will return with the kids because the talbott is family oriented and friendly to kids. it felt very safe. anytime we are in chicago the talbott is gonna be our home away from home!",1,0,murk_p381
mturk,The Talbott Hotel is fantastic! I stayed there on business and found that it met my every need. The high speed internet access worked flawlessly; allowed me to do much of my work from the comfort of my luxuriously appointed room. I really like to exercise before a day of meetings; access to the fitness club next door was very convenient. Last point: I work for a green consulting firm out of L.A. and the hotel's environmental credentials dovetailed perfectly with our mission. Guilt free luxury!,1,0,murk_p382
mturk,This hotel was everything we were looking for. My mom and I were on a girls weekend out shopping trip and just needed a place to stay after a long day out. The Talbott Hotel was incredible.

We decided to book the ""Personally Yours Romance Package"" for our stay. When we arrived at the hotel, the staff was very friendly and approachable. The personalized key cards we received upon check-in were a wonderful touch. Each night, we would return to our suite to find the linens turned down and rose petals scattered across the bed. The personal concierge even helped me plan a special outing for my husband and I to see a Chicago Cubs baseball game. I would recommend this hotel to anyone planning a weekend away.",1,0,murk_p384

However, a call to the front desk remedied that situation in about 2 minutes! 5 stars!!!",1,0,murk_p387

The staff treated me really well and they were very friendly. I was afraid that I'd get a little lost, since it was my first trip to Chicago, but the staff helped me navigate to the downtown area (Rush St./Michigan Ave.-- which are *very* close by). The hotel reminded me of those I'd stayed at in Europe. The room service is 24 hours, which for me, was a bonus because I am up mostly during the nights. This is the *only* place I will ever stay if I visit Chicago again. For a single woman traveling alone to a strange city, this hotel made me feel very safe and comfortable.",1,0,murk_p388

mturk,"I was visiting relatives in Chicago and wanted to stay in a hotel that emphasized luxury and was also environmentally friendly, and the Talbott seemed to fit the bill. I also couldn't help but notice all the positive reviews online. I figured I couldn't go wrong and I am happy to report the positive reviews are true. First of all check in was a breeze. I love their online reservation system. It was easy to use and the information presented was quick and accurate. Once I arrived in Chicago I was greeted by Tim at the door and I immediately felt like wanted and liked. The receptionist was very polite and when she heard I was visiting Chicago for the first time, she upgraded my Deluxe King to an Executive King. Score! The room was just as advertised, luxurious and convenient. It was also exceptionally clean and this is very important to me because I am paranoid of germs and bed bugs. Most importantly though, I got a good night's sleeep because the bed and pillows were super soft, but firm enough to help support my back. I also used the Equinox Fitness Club and, wow, what a club. This is another great amenity of the Talbott and easily beats other hotels skimpy workout centers. My check-out was quick, easy, and painless. This hotel gets my highest recommendation. The facilities are immaculate and modern with the recent upgrade, the staff is ultra-friendly and competent, and the location was perfect for my needs.",1,0,murk_p391
mturk,The Talbot hotel is an elegant place to take you wife or husband for a weekend getaway. The personally yours romantic package was fabulous.

mturk,"The atmosphere at the Talbott Hotel is very welcoming when you first walk in. The employees are friendly and will greet you when you first arrive. The hotel seems to be luxurious, even from the lobby, and right away, I was very excited for my stay! I stayed in a double queen room with my friend. The room is spacious enough, and beds are very comfortable. I didn't try the room service, but they do have a fitness club close by with a spa, which is very convenient. I also love how the room has individual climate controls! Very neat! Also handy that there is an iHome in the room. I'm usually stuck using just a regular alarm clock radio at other hotels. I will most likely stay in this hotel another time. It was a wonderful experience!",1,0,murk_p393

We figured it would be a great deal package even though the hotel itself felt too ""ritzy"" for us to travel with our four children.

mturk,"The rates at The Talbott Hotel were cheaper than I had expected, and that was my reason for booking a room. I had been prepared for service and a room similar to what I had experienced in the past, and I was quite pleased when I did stay. The room was neat and clean, and the halls were quiet at night. The traffic noise was muffled to the point where it was no problem sleeping either. I did ask one question at the service desk and they answered it nicely, which is good because normally hotel workers can be a bit snippy, especially at night. Overall I had no problems with The Talbott Hotel and I would stay at this here again if I were in the area a second time.",1,0,murk_p395
mturk,"I enjoyed my stay at the Talbott Hotel. It is on the more expensive side, but it is all worth it. I got the Talbott tradition package, which was $245 for two people and included a $30 breakfast credit on check out day. The rooms are huge! The beds are soft and comfortable. They include Aveda bath products, which is a plus in my book. They also have a nice fitness area & pool you can use while you stay there. One thing I thought was really cool is that you can forward your messages from your hotel room phone to your cell phone. My boyfriend also liked the Ihome audio system. The location of this hotel is very convenient as well, its close to several great restaurants and blocks from the coast. But, what I like best about this hotel is that they make an honest effort to not negatively impact the environment more than they need to. They were one of the first hotels to be Green Sealed. Overall I had a great stay at Talbott Hotel!",1,0,murk_p396

mturk,"My stay at this hotel was one of the best I have ever had! The location, service and accommodations were all outstanding!! The lobby area is beautiful as was my room. In the room there was more than enough space, which is difficult to find in Chicago hotels. My only gripe was the room was a little dark. Sure, staying at a small, upper-class hotel like the Talbott involves paying a premium but it was well worth it. The service was timely and everyone seemed friendly and informed. The room service took a bit longer than I would have liked, however, the food was good quality. Another nice touch was the gym pass provided for guests at the Equinox Fitness Center. Finally, the location is PERFECT!! It's located in a beautiful area of the city near the Gold Coast, which has many very good restaurants. A personal favorite of mine is Mario's, a nice Italian place nearby.

trip_advisor,"Stayed at the Fitzpatrick as a result of all of the glowing reviews on TripAdvisor and to avoid the normal corporate hotel. Good location but the room was dirty, and not just from the last housekeeping. It was dingy: a place where you needed the slippers they provided. And this was a suite. Also, the refrigerator was caked with ice and didn't work. Furthermore, because my travel agent had mixed up the dates I was to travel, I showed up a day late. The hotel said it wasn't a problem and that I wouldn't be charged for the no-show the night before. I had my travel desk verify this with the hotel management the same day. Then the Fitzpatrick charged me for both nights and refused to reverse the charges after many attempts to resolve. Neither I nor my corporate travel desk will use the Fitzpatrick again. Two dots only because it's in a good location and because the lobby was clean. I'm generally easy to please and slow to complain but this was bad.",0,nan,ta_n1

We where moved to another room, but it was smaller then the orginal room we had gotten and paid for. The next day the housekeeping service never even came to change our sheets, coffee or towels, which is just horrible service. The service along with the orginal room where perfect, but we do not plan on ever spending another weekend in that flooding hotel.",0,nan,ta_n2
trip_advisor,"This hotel is a shambles-furniture literally falling apart and a staff that is both rude and uninformed, nevermind the lack of security and the absence of the so-called amenities. The ""fitness center"" is an oversized closet! We were appalled during our stay! Truly anticipated ""warm, Irish hospitality"" and short of a barman, no one was Irish, warm or hospitable! Manager was unresponsive to our needs and front desk attendent was incredibly rude when we made a simple request. Her manager (?) refused to come out of the office when she called to ask them to speak with us. Room was pretty at first glance but when dresser drawers fell out and the major construction of the hospital next door began at 7:30am it is not the kind of experience anyone could tolerate. To call this a Red Roof Inn would be an insult to RRI! The manager that finally called us back was soooo fake and insincere that we would have prefered no call at all. The only thing they have going for them is the location but its not worth the trade-off.",0,nan,ta_n3
trip_advisor,"The hotel itself was beautiful and wonderful staff but the bottom line for me was that it was impossible to sleep through the night because the noise of the ambulance sirens continued throughout the night. For THREE consecutive nights. There was simply inadequate soundproofing - even 14 floors above the street (OK - 13 floors as there is no 13th floor). I hesitate to write this review but I rely on Trip Advisor reviews when traveling, and had I been warned about the ambulance sirens, I would have chosen to stay elsewhere. If you are a sound sleeper and noise is not an issue then it is a lovely hotel and excellent value. Conveniently located. Wonderful staff.

I was floored, but after a delayed flight and a 2 hour cab ride, was too tired to make a fuss. We were hungry after all the delays and planned on attending an event that night, so we called for room service hoping to keep it simple. I was told that room service would call ME back to take my order...and nothing happened. I didn't want to be late to our event so we ended up going to the restaurant downstairs. Nothing special; entree, dessert and NAB for two still came out to $*...I am no hayseed, I'm WELL aware that everything costs more in Chicago, but this just wasn't worth it.

If you're a traveler who likes using the in-room coffeemaker, they charge for their chintzy coffees (I don't use these, but... come on). Nice enough ambience in the upstairs bar, but weak drinks... That night, our bed was so tiny and uncomfortable that I almost asked to switch rooms. But the Marathon was that weekend; the hotel was so busy I didn't want to be a pest.

Very dusty between window frames(I understand - cars,pollution) but it looked like it wasn't cleaned for a very long time.One more thing really made me upset - broken blinds on a right side. I was unable to pull them down to enjoy my sleep time...We didn't notice the problem until very-very late.The Affinia hotel serving tourists and guests of Chicago as well as Northwestern Hospital patients and their families - which really need extra privacy and comfort !

trip_advisor,"Having stayed at the excellent Affinia chain in NY, I had very high expectations. When I saw the Trip Advisor rating, I immediately booked. What a huge disappointment: -- The quality Simmons pillow top mattress is covered with very cheap, foam pillows -- the kind they sell in the store for $4. You cannot sleep on these -- The windows are so thin, you can hear the buzzing from walk/don't walk sign on Superior below. -- The walls are so thin that when my neighbor smoked, I was awaken around midnight, my room engulfed in smoke odor. A call downstairs yielded no results -- There are nice furnishings but many are chipped showing bare wood; the desk chair was full of loose threads -- The water flow is very weak, but the towels are nice -- There are unpainted floorboards, the kind you find in Day's Inn -- They charge for internet service The tiny lobby has materials and pictures of what the hotel will eventually look like. The sign outside is also a banner. Having stayed all over the U.S., you are better off at Red Roof -- this is really an embarassment for the Affinia chain. Wait until they complete the renovations in 2008. I did supply this feedback at my checkout and the front desk apologized by shaking my hand. Good heart, but the problems are not fixable.",0,nan,ta_n7
trip_advisor,"I've been here for 4 days. Great location right off of miracle mile, near all major hotels, best shopping and theatres. Rooms very large. Hotel staff very friendly and helpful, and respond immediately. Problems: there frequently are homeless people (even during daylight) on Superior between St. Clair and Michigan Avenue (the main route you walk for or all activities, and just about everything is in walking distance from here). At night, the street on the north side of Superior is dark, and it usually smells strongly of several unpleasant odors. The street people do not approach you, although they may stare as you go by. Usually 2 or more along the way, where they sleep on the window sills of Neiman Marcus. I would not think a woman would feel safe by herself. (I am from a large city and do not have a street people phobia.) There are homeless up and down Michigan Street, but this is different as it's a lonely stretch and no open business is along either side of the street. The entire hotel needs a lot of cosmetic work, and apparently will soon undergo a major renovation. For now, expect two extremely small, warm, slow elevators with long waits serving 17 floors and warm, cramped hallways! All the walls throughout the hotel need painting, and the wallpaper is peeling in places. In the room, several electrical outlets were hanging out of the connection, the carpets were stained, the bathrooms needed new grout (some mold visible), the TV is very small (16 Inch?) and the windows very, very dirty. You won't get your room serviced unless you ask for it, sometimes more than once. The ""pub "" downstairs is run down, dark and kind of creepy. Food and room service are very expensive, as is parking ($34/day public and $38/day valet). On the plus side, the bed was very comfortable, there was ample comfortable furniture in the sitting area, plenty of space and a decent view as the hotels spans St. Clair street toward the north and south. You can see a sliver of Lake Michigan. Pool small, but clean. All in all, it was clean and quiet and provides lots of space for sitting around in the room, but I think it is overpriced, and I would not stay here again.",0,nan,ta_n8

The front desk staff was incredibly rude and unhelpful. The hallways and elevators are small, cramped and uncomfortable. The rooms are great - great beds, great television set. NO ROOM SERVICE - the kitchen is under construction. The bottom line is that during our stay, this was NOT a full-service hotel and should not have charged what they did.

trip_advisor,"My husband and I stayed overnight at the Affinia. Prior reviews led us to believe this was a quality hotel; not true. Since it was a very special occasion, and also because we were only staying overnight, we didn't let the shabbiness and poor service of the hotel ruin our weekend. However, this would have qualified as one of the poorest hotel experiences. I've ever had. First, the smells: The linens and pillows on our bed smelled moldy and mildewy. The odors were not mild, and I found it pretty repulsive. I couldn't wait to jump out of bed in the morning, to get away from the odors. Hard to sleep and certainly didn't want to be in the bed any longer than absolutely necessary. I didn't discover how disgusting the bed smelled until around midnight when we got into bed. At that point, I chose not to contact housekeeping because (a) I was exhausted, and (b) I didn't want to upset my husband, who had fallen immediately to sleep after a long day of sightseeing. Also, the bathroom smelled like vinegar. Perhaps this is the cleaning agent used by Affinia, but the odor should have dissipated over the course of our stay and it never did. Incidentally, the bathroom floor tiles and wallpaper looked like they had seen better days; not a well-maintained property. Second, the elevators: If you stay above the first few floors, there are only two elevators that run from ground level to the rooftop c-view bar. With so many floors to service, and so many people going up to the c-view bar on a saturday, these elevators took forever to come, and were often full they did. Annoying. Also, on one occasion, there were several bottles (water and soda) left in the elevator; clearly, the maintenance crew doesn't inspect and clean the common areas frequently. Finally, and perhaps the most disappointing was the service when we arrived. First, when we booked, we asked for as quiet a room as possible. The hotel is located near Northwestern Memorial Hospital. But, its proximity to Michigan Ave., and the lack of accomodations elsewhere (due to the Transformers movie filming and a big international convention taking place the same week-end), led us to stay here anyway. At check-in, the clerk noted our request, and said our room was quiet room since it was not ""next to the elevators."" When we arrived at our room, we discovered that we were across from the elevators. Obviously, she was technically correct that we weren't next to the elevators, but it was still so close (15-20 feet) that we could hear the elevator noise. Also, since it was a special occasion, we asked if we could upgrade. The disingenuous, snarky, condescending clerk told us that checking in early was an upgrade. Clearly, the woman has not travelled enough to know that in many quality hotels, this is a matter of routine, not exception. Pretty awful experience all the way around. Other reviewers must have very low expectations. Can't explain any of the good reviews otherwise.",0,nan,ta_n17
trip_advisor,"We connected to Affinia Chicago thorugh a city websight. The deal was fair for a downtown hotel on the main drag with an attractiion included. There was information out there that the hotel was being overhauled although we did not pay much attention to that. They are currently under major construction. They will be a little late of their projections in the finish date. I must say that the staff tried very hard to make our stay comfortable under very difficult circumstances. The room was complete and was good. It had a very nice bathroom. The main lobbie and all hotel amenities are totally unfinished drywall with no food, drink, or rest room opportunities. The construction guys did their best to limit activity and noise to after 9:00am. I think this will be a good one once they are done. As of the end of May, they have a way yet to go.",0,nan,ta_n18
trip_advisor,"This hotel does not live up to the reviews. The room was larger than I expected. However, the decor was a bit dated. The bedding was ripped, carpet was stained, and the shower door was broken. There was a long wait to the elevators, and if you're on floors 2-6 you need to take a second elevator to get to the roof bar and gym. The main issue I had was the attitude I received from the staff. There was literally only ONE nice person at the front desk. There are no ice machines in this building, so you have to request it from the front desk. One day I requested it by going down to the desk and asking in person. 20 minutes later I made a follow up call because I did not receive my ice. I was nastily told that ice takes 10 minutes and I should just wait. I finally got the ice 10 minutes later. Two days later I requested ice again. Waited 30 minutes and just gave up. While I was leaving, I mentioned this to the woman at the front desk and she just said ""I didn't get a call for ice."" Well I obviously wasn't making it up, lady! I called and spoke with someone. She didn't even apologize or offer me anything. Overall, I would not recommend this hotel. There are so many hotels in the Chicago area. Choose a different one.",0,nan,ta_n19
trip_advisor,"This hotel must have originally been an ordinary downtown hotel in a not very nice neighborhood. The owners have painted it over and fixed up the lobby to make it an ""upscale"" overpriced boutique hotel. But it's still just an ordinary hotel with a paint job.

trip_advisor,"My Husband and I did not enjoy stay at Hotel Allegro! The room was so small. The bathroom was ridiculously stupid, everytime you use the sink you would splash water on yourself. Truly one person at time in the bathroom, it was like being in an airplane's bathroom. The walls are so thin, we heard the people across hall having sex. The some staff were really rude. I did not appreciate it when we had a sign on the door saying do not disturb the day of our check out. Check out time is 11am or 12 and we got a know on the door at 8AM with the sign stating "" do not disturb. "" The hotel did not have any microwaves in their rooms, no mini fridge, and no coffee maker either. NO DRAWERS to put your clothes in and the closet was very very very tiny. We were there for four days and three nights, so we had three suit cases full of clothes and no places to store them at. I also hated the fact that we had to pay almost fifty to park our car. My Husand and I will never stay at Hotel Allegro again!!!",0,nan,ta_n21
trip_advisor,"I stayed at the Allegro Hotel while interviewing for a position in Chicago. I read the reviews and they were mixed, but since the property was suggested by the organization (due to location), I booked a room. True to the reviews, the room was extremely small, was cold (the heater blew in cold air in -2 degree weather), and just generally uncomfortable. There was no closet so I hung my suit on the doorknob of the door of the adjoining room. The bathroom was extremely small and although tidy, not especially clean (it was dusty). The bed (which was supposed to be a queen but was really a full) was quite low and the sheets were hard. Because I arrived late, I ordered room service. There was so little space in the room that the wait staff had to approach the desk/table sideways. Although there is free wireless (a plus), I kept getting kicked out of the system and had to, no lie, reconnect on-line a record 16 times. Finally, to top it all off, the television stopped working just a little before midnight. I was only there for one evening (not even 12 hours) but that was enough for me. This is supposed to be a 4 star boutique hotel but I've stayed at better 2 star properties. On the positive side, the staff is nice and friendly, the food is reasonably good, and the lobby is really vibrant. There is a martini bar (although as I was coming in, a hotel guest was complaining about it being unsually smokey) that looked interesting. Overall though, not the best stay I've had. I won't be staying again.",0,nan,ta_n22
trip_advisor,"This is about the fourth time we stayed at the Allegro. The previous times, I have nothing but good to say about the Allegro. But my reaction has soured on this place. We have stayed here the past few years on the first weekend in December as a kick off to the holiday season and our shopping. From the very start, this year was a disappointment. I had checked the deals on a number of sites before calling the Allegro. I was quoted one price (higher than what was on line), when I mentioned this, I was told I could have the lower price. At check in, the desk was nice but not friendly. We discovered that our room was not as good as in the past (punishment for asking for a lower price?) The closet had no hangers, we had no place to put our suitcase. No one mentioned the wine reception in the evening. On the second day, we discovered that even our bath mat for the shower was missing. It took two phone calls and almost two hours to get a new one. I wrote the management following our stay. I have yet to receive a reply. Needless to say we will be looking elsewhere when we go into the city the next time. I would advise others to do the same.",0,nan,ta_n23
trip_advisor,"This hotel is rather stupid to be frank. It's a horrible attempt to be retro-sheek but ends up looking similar to that Saturday Night live skit where things are so sheek that they are not functional. The rooms are about the size of a shoe box and there isn't much in them. I actually like the Pedestal in the bathroom but there is no sink. I had to put my make-up on using the toliet for 5-days. It also took me 10-minutes to figure out how to turn on the shower and the bathroom is more like a closet then anything. I had guests over one evening and everyone could hear everyone pee b/c the bathroom doors aren't doors at all and there is no bathroom fan! It was just over the top for me and lots of costruction nearby to keep you up at night. On a good note, the staff are really friendly and the place is really clean. That's about the only good thing I can say about this place. I would not go back.",0,nan,ta_n24
trip_advisor,"Me and my husband stayed in the Allegro Hotel Chicago for 4 days 3 nights recently. We got a room with a king size bed.. Although the room is small, we got no problems with that as there was enough space for our luggages & all. However, we felt that the bed is not exactly comfortable, the bed sheets kinda feel rough to us. The walls are really thin and we could hear our neighbours talking and occasionally the flushing sound. 1 of the days, our room was not cleaned till afternoon and so we went to check with the front desk and was told that we got to request for our room to be cleaned which was a shock to us as we thought that like all hotels, rooms are cleaned except when you put on the no disturb sign. The worst is upon returning to the hotel at night, we found a bag of our garbage in the room and it was right next to our luggage. The housekeeping people must have forgotten to take it out after cleaning our bins. This is unacceptable to us. The hotel is in the theatre district and it is rather quiet at night. Although it is near the CTA trains, i would rec one to stay somewhere close to the magnificent mile where its lively at night or hotels near the chicago river so that you can get a great view. Am staying again at a Kimpton hotel in San Fran next month and i am contemplating if i should change! Overall, not a good experience and i wouldnt choose this hotel again if i were to head to Chicago again!",0,nan,ta_n25
trip_advisor,"We were at the Hotel Allegro for an Industry Analyst event. I could not have expected worse. At first glance, you figured it couldn't be too bad as a Kimpton. The unfortunate issue - service and the people were excellent. However, the rooms just sucked. Imagine your normal hotel room and 1/3 that size. Cramp in a king size bed and add a bathroom that's also 1/3 the size. The building has that old hotel smell where things are musky but covered up with some paint smell. The bathroom has showers with modern fixtures but remind you of that nyc studio you rented with 5 other people out of college. The paints peeling on the base boards, the carpet is new, but something is wrong. I would stay at the Marriott, Renaissance, Westin, or any where else.",0,nan,ta_n26

Maintenance took a look at it, and couldn't figure it out. Told me I'd have to wait until the morning for the electrician. He then passed some gas and left. Real professional. I phoned the front desk on account of the tv, and was able to get another room The second room was much like the first. Horrible striped wall paper, dingy, and old worn carpet. Bathroom was incredibly small. Hard to use the toliet without banging into the door, or the sink. Very cramped. The beds weren't very comfortable either. Room temp hard to regulate and the AC somewhat noisy. Location seem very convenient. I was there for a training session about 8 blocks away. But all of the theatres seemed to be near by, if thats what you were there for this place may be tolerable for a night or two. And don't make a long distance phone call from your room without a calling card. It was about $2/minute. I knew it would be expensive but wasn't expecting that type of rate.",0,nan,ta_n27

At the end of the massage I gave the lady $100 and said thanks you can keep the change, She insisted that I got ""A Hotel Rate"" because Anthony set me up. She called Anthony and confirmed the rate then told me she had to go and pay Anthony the difference - $45. She then offered me a ride to the hotel since she was going there which I declined.

The tub is plastic retro fit as stated in another review, and does crackle under your feet. I, personally, did find the water pressure to be fine and the bath ammenities to be of good quality. The public areas are nice and are good to hang out in. This is basically an old hotel that has been updated. The comment about the closet is true, it is actually indescriable.

trip_advisor,"I'm a frequent business traveler and often in Chicago on trips. At times, it's very difficult to even find a hotel in downtown Chicago, and this was one of those times. I recently had to pay almost $400 for one night at the Allegro. It was absolutely not worth it. The hotel was filled to capacity with conventioneers, so check-in and check-out were very slow. There were very few elevators, which were worked beyond capacity with all the guests. The morning I checked out, our elevator stopped at every single floor from the 16th floor down to the lobby, but the elevator was almost completely full when I got on at the 18th floor, so I can only imagine how long it must have taken other guests to get downstairs. The room was extremely small and cramped, even though it had obviously been renovated recently. The TV, bed, and decor were all new and were the high points of the hotel. Still, the rate was way overpriced for such a small room. The best thing about the Allegro was the room service, which was prompt. The food was good, and the prices were very reasonable for room service. From now on, if my regular hotels are booked, I'll just take a cab farther out from the city because it just isn't worth it.",0,nan,ta_n30
trip_advisor,"As I sit here in my 14th floor room at the hotel Allegro, I listen to the conversation between husband and wife in the room on my left. She seems to have a cough today. In the room on my right, someone seems to use the restroom quite a bit. I hear the water running and the toilet flushing. I also hear footsteps in the room upstairs. Even roadside motels have better insulation between the rooms. I've stayed in about a dozen Kimpton hotels and this is by far the worst. The room is dirty - the carpet covered in spots and stains, the curtains with a large brown stain (I don't want to guess what it is), paint peeling, rips in the wallpaper. The decor is a bit garish, with Pepto-Bismol covered walls, green and yellow pillows and the filthy brown and white carpet. The size of the room is fine and the bed comfortable, but I'm so glad I had earplugs to avoid listening to others' toilets flushing all night. The location is good for downtown theaters or business. Only three elevators serve this 17+ storey building and they run very slowly. Chicago has many nice hotel options -- many I've enjoyed quite a bit. Unfortunately this is not one of them, and even more unfortunate for me: I'm stuck here for two more nights. I was looking forward to staying here because most Kimptons are hip, comfortable and attractive. This is not.",0,nan,ta_n31
trip_advisor,"I am usually a big fan of Kimpton Hotels, but this place is awful !!! I would rate it poor from the moment we arrived to the moment we left. It is an old, dark and damp hotel that they slapped a coat of paint on to make it look more ""botique"" . The carpets are dirty, and tattered; patrons are walking around the lobby in their barefeet. yuck!!! The bathrooms are tiny, and the floors look like they have a layer of flith on them. When we called down to the desk to ask for them to be cleaned, we were brushed off and told they were made to look that way. We woke up on the first morning to find multiple wads of gum on the lobby table. We told the front desk, called housekeeping, and then called the front desk again..finally after several hours someone came and cleaned the gum. The elevators are slow, and often only one is working at any given time. I did not find the staff to be friendly at all, except for one waiter @ breakfast. What a disappointment :(",0,nan,ta_n32

We were attracted to this hotel because a bar was on the ground level - however when we went to have a drink, the door to the bar was locked. We called to inquire why the sign said was open when it really wasn't and were told they were short staffed, 'sorry'. WHAT?? are you running here?

trip_advisor,"A disappointment to say the least. I have heard rave after rave about Hotel Allegro and was super excited when our brother-in-law gave us an American Express gift card that we decided to use for a night out! I called Hotel Allegro and made the reservation for a Saturday night. The person who took the reservation was very sweet and assured me that there would be no problem using the gift card, since they do indeed take American Express. I couldn't wait to get there! We arrive at Hotel Allegro at about 3:00 on Saturday afternoon. Me, the tourist, I am already taking pics of the sign out front and trying to get a sneek peak of the ballroom set up for a wedding. We get in the line to check in. I give them the gift card and my check card. They tell me that neither one will work because they are charging the cards for not only the room rate, but for incidentals as well. We give them a credit card instead. While in line checking in, we hear complaint after complaint from other guests and I start to wonder what our experience is going to be like. The guy at the front desk is on the radio with the bell-man. Someone's luggage has been lost. He desk clerk snaps at the bell-man for the entire line to see. Not impressed. We get to our little shoebox of a room that I was so disappointed to see. The rooms on the website looked glorious! My bedroom at home is nicer than this tiny room. The sink is too small - water splashes everywhere even as evident by the water all over the floor when we got into our room. Yuck. We stay the night and go to check out in the morning. Again, I give them the American Express gift card. The clerk says ""their system usually doesn't take them"". I tell him that I called to confirm that their system would take it on Friday. He swipes the card and bam! it works! What do you know?? He was so rude. I will not stay at Hotel Allegro again, nor would I recommend it to anyone. Such a disappointment!",0,nan,ta_n34

I complained to the front desk, who then moved me to a ""premium"" room -- still quite small, but manageably so. The bathroom was tiny, without a vanity, making it difficult to put your toiletries in the room. The location leaves much to be desired, as my room looked out directly onto the El (elevated subway - background noise), and the street was pretty deserted on a Sunday evening. I will say that the free wi-fi was great. If you can find a chain or other hotel closer to Michigan Avene, I'd highly recommend you take that.

While the Allegro is similar to the Monaco in it's decor (less traditional and more funky interior) it is not nearly as nice. The linens are not as high quality as the Monaco and the rooms are not decorated as nice. The rooms are also smaller. The main reason I would not recommend the hotel though, is the bathroom. It has an old tiled floor, with an old sink, and old toilet. It reminds me of something you would find in a men's locker room. Although the Allegro has installed a nice mirror, it does not make up for the limited counter space and dingy apperance. Also, the layout of the bathroom is terrible. The toilet is so close to the wall that the toilet paper sits in your lap as you sit on the toilet. Also, the room is not very clean as well. The floor in my room was dirty and I found crumbs in the drawers.

Clearly i am smart enough not to give this information to anyone yet alone someone who had already taken more then should have been charged. I then called corporate to complain and let them know about the situation the only thing corporate could tell me is that they had already credited my account and that they were sorry and it was clearly my mistake.

When we arrived, we were told that there was a mistake and the hotel was oversold. So, we had to move to another hotel. Amalfi did take care of the other hotel, cab fare, and after much negotiating...breakfast. We were traveling with 2 children and all of this was very inconvenient. Instead of getting up the next morning and going to the museum as we had planned, we had to get up, pack up our suitcases, check out of the hotel, take a cab, check back into the Amalfi, only then could we head to the museum. We were also told that our first night's stay would be refunded. Well, more than 3 weeks and 3 phone calls later...there still hasn't been a refund. I can't even get a manager to call me back. The Amalfi wasn't all bad, it is centrally located close to train and bus stops and has many restaurants within walking distance. The coctail reception had a nice selection of drinks and appetizers. However, it was in a very small room and there was no place to sit both nights we attended. One reason we picked the Amalfi was that it had 2 queen beds instead of doubles, but they seemed really small for queens. Our view from our room was of the alley.

Second, that meant two of us were stuck on a pull out couch. :( I'm not a picky, unreasonable person, but that was the WORST ""bed"" I've ever slept on!

trip_advisor,"We stayed in the Amalfi in July 2010, 4th of July weekend. I was very apprehensive about leaving my Diesel Ford Excursion with the valet at Amalfi. It has a few modifications to the engine and can be damaged if not operated correctly. I explained the procedure to the valet drivers, and felt like it was a complete waste of time. When the vehicle was returned to me the valet driver did not let it idle down and cool the turbo off as I had instructed. When I tried to start it, it wasn't happy, but did finally start. I was so relieved to get it back I just wanted to leave. Driving away I noticed that the top speed recorded on the GPS was 105mph!!! (previous top speed was 95mph, done a few days earlier driving across South Dakota). I could just picture the flying Ferrari scene in Ferris Bueller's Day Off. I couldn't imagine where in the crowded Chicago traffic they found a place to go that fast, though it wouldn't take long to make that happen (see reference to modified engine above). A little while later we stopped for lunch and I noticed a dent in the front bumper. I contacted the hotel and was referred to their claims people. No remedy. Lesson learned. Brett",0,nan,ta_n52
trip_advisor,"Overview: --Overrated hotel in a premium location. The Great: --Location - walking distance or cheap cab ride to a ton of great restaurants, bars, and sights. The Good: --Inviting lobby, pleasant staff though a few were a bit snobby, in particular the night deskman. --Nice bathroom, comfortable bed and desk chair. The Mediocre: --Room (excluding bathroom) was underwhelming in design. --No kitchen or bar though they have limited room service from Harry Caray's across the street. --Free cocktails 5-7pm in ""lounge"" is right idea with wrong execution; tiny little room packed with people and a line extending out the door. --Hot water (or lack thereof) - almost every morning my shower water temperature would waver between comfortably hot to lukewarm. Pressure is pretty low. --View - mine wasn't great but apparently some of the rooms are horrible. The Bad: --Free wi-fi / ethernet has inconstant speeds and required multiple logins every day, even when my computer wasn't moved - really aggravating. Same deal for my iPhone. I also got numerous vulnerability threat warnings from my Norton Anti-virus that makes me wonder how secure it is. --No blackout curtains! I had a corner room with a huge wrap-around window and awoke to bright sunlight every morning (not to mention a near total lack of privacy at night). Never had this issue in any hotel or motel I've ever stayed at. --Noise! - the hotel is sandwiched between a few different bars and the late night cacophony of yelling, bar music, trucks, car horns, and sirens is hugely distracting well into the early hours of the morning. I had to wear ear plugs despite being on the 5th floor. --TV had crappy HD signal with out of sync audio on every channel. And the remote was useless. --In room bar had standard inflated prices but the $7 bottle of Fiji water bedside was insulting. Don't even think of opening it; there's a 7-Eleven around the corner that sells exact same bottle for a fraction of the cost. Summary: --Not recommended. Looks much nicer in the website photos than it is. Rating on Yelp is bloated by at a least a star.",0,nan,ta_n53
trip_advisor,"We stayed at Amalfi for 2 nights and i have to say after reading all the reviews here i expected a little bit more. It's a fine place with clean bathrooms and comfy beds but it's just not worth the money. It does have comfy beds and free continental breakfast. The sheets though, made us itch for some reason and we are normally not sensitive to these things. The breakfast could really benefit from some bagels or yougurt. Otherwise, it's just an early morning sugar attach of muffins, danishes, sweet breads, and croissants. There are plenty of restaurants around but they are all of the big chain variety, if you are into that sort of thing. Also, the windows do not open and there is a climate control device in the room. The problem with it that it keeps blowing air all the time, alternating between cold and warm, right over the bed. There is a sign not to turn it off but we did once just to see what happens and the air in the room got uncomfortably stale. They do have a business center where you can send fax and use internet for free. The problem is it is only one tiny room with one computer in there. One person at a time... All and all, we will not stay there again. If we feel like luxury, we have to find some other place. But if we feel like a regular hotel in the heart of the city, maybe we will try Red Roof Inn or something like that. At least we'll know what we are paying for.",0,nan,ta_n54
trip_advisor,"We went with the great reviews on Tripadvisor. The location, rooms, amenities and price via Expedia were good. My complaint is the poor service at every stage - the check-in was slow (even at 1am), the concierge (Sarita) was hopeless, staff were generally rude. Also there was some sort of generator box under the bed which hummed all night - we turned it off and it also seemed to turn off the air conditioning. Finally, just to let you know that there is a major construction site in front of the hotel and roadworks at 2am with trucks that beep continuously everytime they reverse!!! Would I stay here again? - maybe if I got a good deal and had a back room but there are plenty of other great hotels nearby.",0,nan,ta_n55

During our stay we used the ""Valet"" Service operated through Standard Parking. Our vehicle was returned with stolen items from the glove compartments. Much to my chagrin, $44/day valet service did not include proper security/monitoring, despite the premium over ""self park"". I understand that these parking services are sub-contracted by the hotel, but I would think that any worthy hotel would remedy the situation. This was not the case.

trip_advisor,"My stay at the Amalfi was a very brief one. I booked the hotel based on all of the glowing reviews I saw here on Trip Advisor. When I arrived, I sat down at a desk with an amazingly aloof clerk. I felt like I stepped into an episode of the Twilight Zone. The room was very small and dark. Then the Internet wasn't working. I wasn't informed about this on my check in and couldn't be given a time frame when it would be back up. I walked the neighborhood and found another hotel more to my liking, gathered up my belongings and went there. If you're one of those people who likes trendy upscale and chi chi locations and hotels, you'll lurve this place.

trip_advisor,"My wife and I stayed at the Amalfi on a trip to visit our son and some friends from Norway who were vacationing in the City. We were excited about staying at the Amalfi after reading the reviews here, but really disappointed in the accommodations. The web site has a photo of the 18 story building that houses the hotel. It doesn't state that the hotel only occupies the first 6 floors of the building. The rest are offices. Our room was on the 4th floor with a view of a blank brick wall about 16 feet distant. The room itself was unremarkable, with standard furnishings equivalent to a Holiday Inn. Although it is close to the best part of the City, it is tucked behind the new Trump Tower and opens on a surprisingly sketchy stretch of road/sidewalk. Our Norwegian friends, by contrast, stayed on the 33rd floor of Swissotel and had views of the Lake and Navy Pier.",0,nan,ta_n58
trip_advisor,"Stayed at the Amalfi hotel in Chicago this month with good expectations. And what a disappointment! Paid just under $200 for a ""deluxe king"", and what we got was a 2nd floor view of construction, a dirty, badly ""rehabbed"" bathroom, itchy sheets, no down comforter!! (just sheets and the gross old hotel blanket thing) , previously opened bottles in our mini bar, and plenty of rude, inexperienced staff members & managers (def. not a 3 or 4 star staffing!!) I do live in Chicago, and have stayed at a wide range of places. I know that for $200 in February, you can expect a great hotel. As there were many available the weekend we stayed at Amalfi, choosing it over say, the Palmer House Hilton, Hotel Sax, Sutton Place, Hotel 71, was a huge waste. Definitely keep looking and book elsewhere. Not worth the price at all, don't let their pictures fool you. Also, I wouldn't say that our experience was just a rare mishap, the hotel looks like an old Days Inn that had undergone a slight renvation, i.e., new lamps.",0,nan,ta_n59
trip_advisor,"I've used Priceline for every trip I've made back to Chicago and I've been fortunate to have stayed in some excellent hotels downtown. This was my first and last stay at the Ambassador East. Its conveniently located near the Clark/Division stop on the El's red line. That is the best part of our experience. When we checked in we were charged additional for upgrading from a king bed to two queens. I've never had that issue at any other hotel I've stayed at. The room's decor was outdated and the TV was tiny. The hotel charges for usage of Internet. You could hear people in the hallway and when you're in the hallway you could easily hear people in the rooms. We weren't in Chicago to stay in the hotel however, for people that might want a romantic weekend this definitely isn't the place. ...read more",0,nan,ta_n60
trip_advisor,"The Ambassador East was a average hotel at best, and mediocre at worst. The bright spot is a very helpful and friendly staff. The doormen and the concierge were especially helpful and willing to do what they could for you. The room was lackluster, however. The bathroom was in especially bad shape. It was dirty when we arrived, with hair in the sink and shower. The shower was in really bad shape. The shower head adjustment did not work properly and water pressure was very low. The water temperature did not get warm during the first morning of our visit. The decor throughout the hotel (lobby, hallways and rooms) was very out-of-date and old-fashioned. I would have liked there to have been a vending machine in the hotel as well. The business center with free Internet access was a nice feature that was easy to use. The hotel's location was okay though it was a bit of a hike to the most popular tourist destinations.

The hotel is currently under construction and while they claim to be open, you wouldn't know it. You need to take an elevator to get from the street the lobby and the rooms are bare lacking even an alarm clock. The beds are propped up on a modern bed stand but you might think that you are in a stale mental asylum and not a ""nicer historic hotel."" I will try them again once the construction is through but would recommend staying at any other hotel in the meantime. It was a very frustrating experience.",0,nan,ta_n62
trip_advisor,"I was initially very excited to be staying at the Ambassador East hotel. The photos online appeared very classy and upscale and I thought staying there would be a pleasant experience. Upon arrival I was very disappointed - the main lobby was closed for construction making it somewhat difficult to get around. Our room was very dated - old furnishings and linens, damaged tile - it fell quite short for the high price we paid. It is an older building with very thin walls allowing you to clearly hear all other guests in surrounding rooms and also the lovely slam of doors of departing guests in the morning. Doorways are extremely narrow in hallways and room - gives a very claustrophobic feel to the hotel.",0,nan,ta_n63
trip_advisor,"In my experience the Ambassador hotel didn't seem to be a 3 1/2 star establishment. The building and lobby were nice but the hotel room was extremely dated. The carpeting was very old and worn. The floor - carpeting and tile both seemed dirty which made me very uncomfortable. I would imagine that many years ago this was a very nice hotel. Currently, it's indespirate need of renovation.",0,nan,ta_n64

Hotel is great for guys getaway weekend that won't have a car. Not a family frienly hotel. Dining tip: Long walk from hotel Gino's pizza is a must have!! Worth the walk. Many things in between hotel and Gino's to do so you can break up the walk.",0,nan,ta_n65

They charge a lot for internet hook up, wifi is not included. The staff was very slow, I am assuming they were all new. They could not say where anything was or what attractions were nearby. The room was set up weird, the bathroom opened facing the bed, rather than the hall as most do. Room temp was hard to control, even though they had a digital thermostat. Overall I was very disappointed, had I been staying more than one night I would have switched hotels.",0,nan,ta_n66
trip_advisor,"We booked through a travel website. This hotel is currently undergoing major renovation and will be renamed in September. The public areas are still being renovated but the hallways and rooms are done. The hallway was so dimly lit, we couldn't see how to use the key card. The shock came when we entered the room. Whoever designed it obviously did not take function or a guest's comfort into consideration. The bed was a mere 15 inches off the ground - a mattress (rock hard) over a platform. The ""nigh stands"" were shelves attached to the wall at around 12 inches height. The room was stark - all off-white, no color. No art work or any decoration at all. The full-length drapes completely blocked the air conditioning unit; if it were winter and the heat was on, I think this could be dangerous. There was a desk & chair but no clock/radio in the room; there was a wall mounted LCD tv with very poor channel selection. The bathroom was very small but clean. The problem with it was that the tub was almost 2 ft high and difficult to step in to. An older person could have never stayed in the room. Because of the renovation, there was no restaurant on-site. No vending or ice available on the floor either I can't see anyone ever becoming a repeat guest at this hotel. I would never stay there again.",0,nan,ta_n67
trip_advisor,"I arrived here at about 8pm after a flight from California. I didn't know about the renovation when I made the reservations, but that didn't bother me very much. I was helped by a man at the front desk named Ben, who was friendly enough, but literally just handed me my room key and told me to have a nice stay. He gave me NO information about anything. I had no idea where breakfast was served, or even if there WAS breakfast. There was also an EXTREMELY unpleasant woman working behind the desk(she wasn't wearing a name tag but was African American, slim with short hair) who seemed to be actually radiating hostility. It made me very uncomfortable and needless to say, made me feel unwelcome. I actually felt like I was putting her out by staying in the hotel. I encountered her again the next morning when I had to go downstairs to ask a question and again tried to smile at her a bit, and again was met with utter disdain and rudeness. I also watched her interact with another guest and saw her act with the same rudeness and bad manners. No matter what may be going on in one's life, when you work in customer service you need to leave whatever is happening at the door and put on a smile. I was appalled by her demeanor. My room was alright, there was no clock which I found very odd. Since I came from a different time zone my computer and phone had 2 different times and I was constantly confused as to which one was correct, especially upon waking up in the morning. It would have been nice to have a clock. There was also no literature on local sites, maps, restaurant menus, or even anything with the hotel's name and address in the room. Also, the mattress was the absolute worst mattress I've ever slept on in my life. I woke up every morning with a sore back and neck. I've had better sleep on a hard, lumpy futon. It was absurd. Like another person posted, my tub did not drain either, and I was also shocked that there were no soda machines or ice machines to be found. Maybe they were around somewhere, but I wasn't made aware of it at check-in, and I didn't want to go downstairs and ask for fear of being treated like I was a burden to the employees. The hotel is in a good location and the rooms look nice upon first glance, but I absolutely would not stay here again. I've had more pleasant stays at a cheap chain hotel, which was a bummer because it was my first visit to Chicago and I had pretty high expectations.",0,nan,ta_n68

Room service has been eliminated despite the renowned Pump Room being located in the hotel, there was no in-room directory, the carpet was torn and stained, no phone book, the refigerator and honor bar had been removed, and the room was so small I had to turn sideays to get past the bed and the armoire. I asked the desk clerk about larger rooms, and he said they were all the same except for corner rooms - which is untrue, as there are several larger room types. He didn't even offer to check availablity of other rooms! In talking with the consierge, she blamed everything on upcoming renovations - which the hotel has been promising for more than two years. All in all, a very disappointing, and expensive, experience.",0,nan,ta_n69

How can they have guests in a room where the carpet looks like it had been mauled by a giant earthworm? 2. The furniture was severely chipped. Ok. I dont mind chipped furniture if I am slumming it in my just-out-of-college-sister's apartment. But for 170+ a night, I want a room that does not look like it was furnished with stuff retrieved from a dumpster drive 3. The receptionist while I was checking in was super curt.

trip_advisor,"Stay Away! After generations as an old-world, cozy and stately, if a bit tired oasis, the AE has been purchased by Ian Schrager and taken down so many notches it's almost not functional. Allowing for the fact that the hotel is under renovation, the entrance is not handicapped accessible, and I saw several hotel guests with canes, casts, etc (including myself, recovering from foot surgery and in a cast, with a cane) struggling with the up and down outside stairs one has to navigate just to get into and out of the hotel. With luggage, it's almost impossible. This is simply inexcusable. I've been a customer of the Ambassador East for decades--but no more. The hallways are so dark one can barely see. The rooms are stark white, which in and of itself, isn't a particular problem, but it is jarring and almost painful as one's eyes adjust from the dark hallways. The furniture--stark and scant--looks like something from an Ikea closeout. The bed is comfortable--what a relief--but only about 15 inches off of the floor, a real problem if you're at all physically challenged, or even elderly and less flexible than you were in your salad days. The problems don't end there. My room had a horribly uncomfortable wire/metal desk chair, and absolutely nowhere else to sit. No arm chair, no demi-sofa, no ottoman. With a foot in a cast, it would have been nice to be able to sit comfortably, perhaps even with my leg elevated, while in the room. No way. The bathroom has absolutely nowhere to put any of your toiletries. Not a shelf, a small table, a nook, or a medicine cabinet. If you want to put a razor, shaving cream, makeup (for women) or anything else down so that you can use them, you're sh*t out of luck. Repeated requests for a small table or some sort of chair went unmet. A borrowed umbrella from the front desk was broken and unusable, something I didn't discover until caught in an expected downpour. I was tempted to throw it out, but remembered that they would charge me for it if I didn't return it, in spite of its total lack of usefulness. Refrigerator--forget it. Shampoo? For two days in a row, the housekeeper left several bottles of lotion, and no shampoo. Room service--not available. If you want breakfast, the front desk will sell you a small, pre-wrapped, commercial grade muffin for $4.00--something you can buy in any gas station for $1.00. No added value whatsoever. The photos show a nice entrance, and a large lobby for which the AE has long been famous. Unfortunately, that lobby is closed off, under construction, and the temporary lobby is on the second floor, difficult, again, for handicapped access. Thermos-bottled coffee and water for tea were stone cold, at 8 in the morning. When confronted with these various misses, the front desk staff repeatedly shrugged their shoulders and said, ""Yeah, we know, you're not the first to tell us this stuff."" All this shows is that Schrager doesn't even care to make an effort to make his guests comfortable, and that the staff is either too indifferent or too amateur to know the difference and even make an effort to get it right. It's one thing to get a good price on a hotel room when it's under renovation. It's another thing altogether to get screwed in the bargain, particularly after booking a non-refundable pre-paid reservation. Again, avoid this hotel like the plague.",0,nan,ta_n73

At $220/night we were expecting a decent, clean hotel but obviously not a 5*. We were highly disappointed by the state of the room we were given (1546). The paint/wallpaper/tub were peeling, there was hair in both the tub/toilet when we got to the room, the internet service was extremely slow, the toilet ran throughout the night, and quite frankly we were not convinced the bedding was changed from the previous guests as it was wrinkled and look slept in. We told the gentleman working at the front desk about the state of our room and his response was ""I know, we can't wait for our renovations."" If it hadn't been for the fact we were meeting up with our relatives who were traveling from the UK & booked into this hotel by a travel agent, we would have checked out as soon as we checked in. Let me also add that the front desk seemed short-staffed as the check-in/check-out process was painfully slow. All we can credit the hotel with is a great location and very friendly/responsive door staff. In its day this was likely a lovely hotel & but it is in dire need of a renovation.

Not only has room service been eliminated (if you want room service it comes from Marios Italian restaurant down the street, so is ONLY Italian), complimentary morning coffee is no longer available, mini bars have been removed from the rooms, etc. etc. The only restaurant, the Pump Room was closed for a private function on Saturday night, the bar also, so we weren't even able to have an after dinner drink with our guests. Surely the function was planned before we made our reservations, but we weren't told of it. We also learned that the bell staff (who have been there for 13 and 8 years) is being eliminated. So, in other words, anyting to do with ""service"" is gone from this hotel. I hear they are going to begin renovations in December, but that is no excuse to let an old glory ""go to pot"" in the meantime. We won't be staying here when we go back in July or for Thanksgiving.

We recently put up a candidate (and his family) we were recruiting for our company at the Conrad. We had had good luck with this hotel when it was a Le Meridien. It was a disappointment for all concerned as a Conrad. On the plus side, our guests were able to check in early with no problem and they generally liked their room. On the downside... They learned after the fact that all rooms with two beds have no bath tub (only a shower). Our guests moved to a room with a bath tub and found hairs in it, which they had to clean themselves. When the coffee bar had no caffeinated coffee and our guests asked for some, they were told it would be delivered immediately. When they called 30 minutes later the front desk admitted that they had ""forgotten."" While the concierge and doorman were quite helpful, our guests told us that the front desk personnel were sullen and unresponsive.

The same problem affects the guest room elevators located beyond the registration area. If you go in and out of the hotel more than a couple of times during your stay, you will find the poor elevator layout annoying. The King room is what I would consider small compared to other Chicago hotels. Although I like modern design, the room was quite stark and cold. It was also showing quite a bit of wear and tear. The bathroom was the best part. Has anyone from management tried to sit in the chair and work at the desk? It was the most uncomfortable set-up I've experienced. The views are non-existent for most of the rooms. In a city with amazing vistas, this was disappointing. I saw a couple walking the halls with management trying to find a room that was acceptable to them. Room service breakfast was a highlight of our stay. Excellent food and high quality presentation.

But seriously blah, small, non-luxury rooms with beds that are just really uncomfortable - and for a card rate of $725/night, even in a major city, the rooms better be awesome. I've had waaaay better rooms in NYC for $350/night. (Good thing I had a corporate rate.) And my room was not especially big, despite what the below reviews say. But here's the main problem. Even on the 10th floor, the guy blowing the whistle to summon cabs downstairs woke me up at 6, and 6:15, and 6:30, and 6:45, and 6:50, and 6:55, and...and, well, I finally got up and said screw it, let's greet the day. Maybe everyone else was already up, but somehow I doubt it. Am now safely ensconced in the Four Seasons.",0,nan,ta_n84
trip_advisor,"We've stayed here before but this time around was a marked difference in quality and service - the staff wasn't rude, just incompetent. For example, we ordered wine glasses for the room because the hotel no longer services a mini bar in the room, which seemed like a really cheap way to go for this type of hotel. Nonetheless, the staff brought us 4 coffee mugs... The list of issues goes on unfortunately, including the low grade in-room movie options - our audio and video did not sync on our rental; we eventually had to stop watching after 20 minutes. And the room itself was not clean; the bathroom sink vent holes were black with mold. Clearly the hotel has pulled back on not only amenities, but training or sufficient staff... oh, but the price point for this hotel has stayed the same. Find a newer hotel, there are many in this great city.",0,nan,ta_n85
trip_advisor,"I was expecting an experience comparable to my stays at the Olympia in Seattle. The decor and overall feel of the hotel was much above average but not inspiring. Biggest disappointment was the inadequate internet connection in the room. The wireless was very slow and the hard-wire from the wall did not work at all. I did request a replacement of the wall wire, but it did no help. This hotel can do better than this. With a 5 star rating, it should be an experience to be pleasantly remembered -- but, was just a mediocre experience for me. Even the bed covers were not that special. Needs more intense management. Next time, I will try the Trump facility Thanks",0,nan,ta_n86
trip_advisor,"This hotel has a great location and nice infrastructure. The river north area is full of great restaurants and the north bridge area is great for out of towners. The decor is lovely and a nice hold-over from when this was a Le Meridian. While the Conrad aspires to be in the top tier along with the Peninsula, the Four Seasons, the Ritz and Park Hyatt, it falls short. We and dinner at the Terrace Restarant outside the other day and were initially impressed with the setting and the selection. While the prices were similar to the Peninsula, we figured that it was a nice day and worth a try. Wow, were we ever disappointed. First off, we were told that we could have a seat but only stay until 7. OK, thats fine and we sat down. The waitress made a point to ask if anything was wrong, so that she could make it right. When we indicated that our glasses of champagne were not very full ($20 per glass), she consulted with the manager and then another manager (a heavier fellow in a dark suit). She came back and said that was the standard puor and that she would be glad to bring us additional glasses. What bothers me is not the outcome, but the fact that the management is not service focused. At a Four Seasons or the Peninsula, this would never happen and if we expressed any displeasure, it would be made right. At the Conrad, the Terrace manager just ignored it.",0,nan,ta_n87
trip_advisor,"Booked a room w/ a queen bed for 2 nights for a wonderful NYE, and was rather disappointed. Bed was either the world's smallest queen, or was actually a double, not to mention it was uncomfortably springy. Some of the things in the bathroom had been previously opened and used (q-tips). Lots of noise seemed to carry through the vents as we could hear other rooms rather clearly. When the tv was off, there was a very audible high-pitched humming noise that we could not get rid of unless we unplugged the tv. Hot water was very inconsistent in the shower. It is in a great location, however, next time I will try one of the other hotels in the area like the Intercontinental or Marriott. This might not be too bad if you are passing though quickly on business, but I wouldn't recommend it for a romantic night or two.",0,nan,ta_n88
trip_advisor,"I stayed here 2 nights for a business conference. The food was pretty good. And they had these really good mints that I couldn't resist. The room was very comfortable and the bed was great. But I was annoyed by many issues. First, their internet went down for a couple of hour when I was there on a break from the conference. It wouldn't have been big deal except I needed to do some business while it was down. Second, the internet wasn't available in the conference rooms. I suppose the conference I attended would have had to pay extra for it. Third, The chair in the room was too low for the desk so I was in an awkward position while using my computer which gave me a back ache later. Fourth, on the second night my key didn't work. So I asked for a new one which also didn't work. So I asked for another one and the same thing happened. Thankfully the front desk asked a security guy to meet me up at my room so I didn't have to go back down to the lobby a third time. Then he came back a little later to tell me I was in the wrong room, which I wasn't. Finally, he came back with the right key. Fifth, the TV had one remote control for changing the channels and a different one for the volume. Sixth, they didn't have the comedy channel. Much cheaper hotels do. If this hotel didn't cost so much money all of these things would be minor inconveniences, but I would expect more for what I paid.",0,nan,ta_n89
trip_advisor,"The Conrad has all the right stuff - great bedding, fancy decorations, beautiful lobby, etc. However, they are seriously missing the boat when it comes to customer service and attention to detail. When I checked in, I went to get a glass of wine from the minibar, only to discover that everything in the fridge was warm. I called for help and was cheerfully told that they would send an engineer right away to fix it. In the meantime, I said, great, but what about a cold drink? They proceeded to send me 1 glass of wine via room service, without asking me if this would be okay. I paid $25 for 1 glass of wine. The minibar bottle would've given me 2 glasses for about $33. Nothing was said to me about this obvious difference. When I called to complain, I was made to feel cheap. To me, it was not the money, it was the principle. The next morning, my bill showed that I had eaten something out of the minibar. I had not. I called, and they said that the automatic sensors in the minibar must have triggered something (duh - when the engineer came and took the entire fridge out of its compartment to fix it), and they took the charge off. They also took $10 off my room service bill, but I was still annoyed that nobody bothered to apologize or acknowledge the fact that I was overcharged. Also, when they fixed the minibar fridge, they did not replace anything in it. The guy said, it'll take a while for things to cool down. Oh, really? How about the warm beer, that was once cold, that will now taste disgusting? I guess they're saving that for the next person who checks into my room and has no idea. Another annoyance was that the lighted mirror in our bathroom did not work. When I plugged it in, it made 2 other lights in the bathroom go off, and then it never would come on. It seems that the Conrad thinks it can spend a lot of money to make itself look beautiful, without worrying about each customer's experience. I don't think they go into the rooms and check them out.

We kept having to remind them we booked a package, because we were being over-charged separately for everything, when it should have been included. We were supposed to have champagne in the room upon arrival, and did not. Two phone calls and three hours later, it finally showed up. We tried to have a drink in the bar, and even though we were the ONLY people there, three servers/bartenders came and went, talking to each other, not one of them acknowledging us. After ten minutes we left the hotel and went down the street for a drink. And don't bother to pay extra for ""City View""; because you may get the view we had from only the sixth floor, looking across the street directly into a plain brick wall - that is all we could see. Oh yes, the valet lost his cell phone in someone's car, and called me at home today to see if we found it. He wanted me to call him back at home.

The room service cost was super high - costing us over $100 for 1 burger, 1 order of french toast, 2 pops and 2 desserts. In the middle of the night the pipes in our room made a very loud vibrating noise which kept us awake. We called the front desk and it took almost 40 minutes for someone to walk over to our room (we were on the 5th floor, same as the reception desk). They did nothing to fix it and the same thing continued the following night and anytime the room above us or to the right used their shower. The staff was friendly enough, but NOT helpful and they did nothing to try and make our stay better with all of the problems. There was not even a coffee pot in the room.

trip_advisor,"I gave the Conrad a second try at impressing me and it failed miserably. The hotel will not honor room requests. I expressed this was for a special occasion and would love a room with a view on my reservation. I got there and my 'view' was of the adjacent office building windows. I didn't pay nearly $400 a night for that. I called down and the manager was absolutely rude. ""That would've required you to pay at least $40 more.."" Rude. Lots and lots of mistakes happened. Requested pillows were never sent up, the television sound was not functioning (i.e. NO sound), when telling the manager of the problems he was horribly condescending and cared very little. I've had better service at a Hampon Inn! When they screwed up our breakfast vouchers I had to physically go down and question it.. they said ""we will send them right up"".. No, that never happened. Absolutely ridiculous. The bathroom has always been nice, and the room had been renovated since I was there last year (thank the lord!)... It had a nice ambiance to it. The bed was quite nice as well. The valet guys were fantastic, probably the nicest men within that entire hotel. Also the bellman, and housekeepers were wonderfully sweet and always said ""hi"" or ""hope you have a wonderful day"".. I appreciated that. Perhaps the management team needs to go back to training school to learn about customer service. Breakfast at the Conrad restaurant is to be avoided completely. The service was abysmally inept, and not to mention slow. We had two different watresses and it took upward of 15 minutes just to get our juice. They looked like they hated their jobs, and treated us with the same attitude. We were never checked on after the food came. The food is overpriced and the quality is severely lacking. I got a continental breakfast and it included a muffin (burnt), a small croissant, and a tiny cinnamon roll. 14 dollars for that. Laughable. Or if you choose, for 14 dollars you can get some toast and juice! Spare yourself and choose to eat elsewhere where you can get an actual tasty meal for your money. Overall, the managers need to learn what customer service means, and how to bend over backwards for a customer. Otherwise your business will crumble. And the Conrad has crumbled for me.

Moreover, I did not hear a single ""I'm sorry"", it was like usual business. What bothered me the most was that the receptionist kept telling me ""I will decrease the rate for you"" ""what do you think, nice eh?"" like he was doing me a favor!!!! They decreased the rate to that of the rooms they gave us of course (which is the legal thing to do, since I am sure is illegal to charge me for one room and give me a lesser value one for the same money). They did not care that I wanted higher level room independent of value. I did not know what to say, since this never happened to me before, also with family present did not want to start arguing.

EXTREME water saving devices on both the shower and tub provided basically a trickle of water. I was unable to get the shampoo out of my hair as pressure was so poor. Also be prepared to be nickled and dimed to death. There was even a $10 charge if you used the coffeemaker in the room, really! For room service they tack on a delivery charge and a 20% gratuity. Since the waiter does not stay to serve you how is he earning a gratuity. I have already been charged for him to deliver the food. The parking fees were outrageous at $51 a night but to add insult they charge a hotel patron the same fees as the general public.

For example, he got locked out of our room 2 times, once having to wait for 15 minutes in the hallway after going to the spa. The other time was when he was getting ready for our wedding ceremony, so that was stressful because he lost some time. The keycard just would stop working. Then a fuse blew, so we had no power while trying to get ready. It happened to me also, coming back from the spa, and I called on the hallway phone to get help. Luckily, right after that, an employee who was randomly walking by asked me if I had been waiting long--as if she knew this was a problem. I said no, and she called down to check. Apparently, no one had even called Security to get me back into my room! She had a set of keys and let me in, thank god. Then, on our wedding night, my husband wanted to order from room service. It was a little after 10:30pm. We were told that room service was closed for the night--even though all the literature in the room brags about ""24 hour dining."" That fact was never communicated to us when we checked in. I feel like the quality of service and amenities are slipping. We later heard something about a lot of employees getting laid off, so maybe that's why people weren't too intersted in providing good service.

Other issues with this property is the shower pressure is not very good. The bed was hard and uncomfortable. And I would say there are many other properties that have a better location and price in the city.

If you want to use a pool there is a health club next to the hotel but you have to pay $20 a day to use it. $80 for a family to take a little swim was a bit ridiculous.

The upholstery was frayed, the bathtub faucet produced only a trickle of water, and the room's door didn't close unless you pulled on it in a certain way. Worse, the management has filled the room with price lists and displays of things to sell you, with one set of snacks even in a large tacky plastic case on the dresser. It was like sleeping in an old vending machine, but when I looked for a pen to take a phone message, there was none to be found. Other reviewers remarked that this hotel ""needs updating,"" but I think some of the original design choices are also to blame. For instance, someone decided to place a series of heavy doors in strange configurations.

We had issues with the plumbing, including extremely slow hot water tap in the bathtub which took 45 minutes to fill. The toilet stopped working twice. We returned one afternoon from the art museum to find the maid in our room, sitting on the bed, watching the tv and talking on her cell phone. They bellman were rude, and wouldn't let my fiance unload our own car which was packed with some of his very expensive camera equipment. There were errors on our bill. Last but not least, we saw a ROACH in the drawers. Alive. The restaurant downstairs was decent, and the location is fairly good since my conference was in the Hyatt next door but for the price you can find someplace better. I will never ever stay here again under any circumstances.",0,nan,ta_n116
trip_advisor,"This hotel was chosen by my husband's company as the family came along for the business trip. The location was excellent and we had a great view of the lake and aquarium from the 34th floor. My first impressions were that the room was very nice and everything appeared to be clean. The lobby was undergoing renovation at the entrance, but was otherwise ok. Lots of conferences were taking place so the wait for the elevators was long. Seemed like only 2 elevators were working out of the 6 that were there. I had read from another reviewer to join the Fairmont President's club and wi-fi in the room would be free. We signed up for the club, but were puzzled as to why they don't just offer everyone free wi-fi. Parking fees were exorbitant at $58/night, but thankfully the company was paying for this. We were able to walk to Millennium Park and Navy Pier from our hotel. The hotel is NOT kid-friendly in terms of restaurants or amenities. There is no swimming pool, but the concierge arranged for us to swim at the Swissotel next door (there is an underground tunnel that connects the Fairmont there). We loved the Swissotel's pool on the 42nd floor. Fantastic views from the pool! Although the beds were comfortable, my daughter and I were both victims of bed bugs during our stay. Unfortunately we didn't know until the next day after we returned home. Apparently bed bug bites can take up to 7 days to appear. My daughter and I both shared a bed and were bitten on our sides from our necks to our hips. The bites made you want to claw your skin off! My husband and son who shared the other bed were not bitten at all. Beware of room 3405 -- bed nearest the bathroom!!! I will not be fooled by a clean room again and will be checking under mattresses from now on....",0,nan,ta_n117

I use to be a regular at this hotel . . . but have not been back for 15 years. Rooms have not been well maintained (old carpets frayed at doors), wall paper peeling off of the walls, TV's from the 80's.

I called the manager to complain, but was put on hold for 30 min. I could hear everything in the room next to me as if there wasn't any wall separating us. I asked for a wake up call, but nobody called me the next morning. When I called to complain the next day, the told me the phone system was down. Ordered room service and got the wrong order...

After nobody was doing anything about it, I notified them of this stay's review will be posted on the newly-developing TheChicagoCritic . Com, all of a sudden they figured out the problem and even offered an early check-in. Too little, Too late. Very small room with 2 queens instead of the ""Select King"" I was supposed to have. Windows didnt open, TV took forever to change channels and the bathroom fan was not controllable. The faboulous Lodge Net system that every hotel in the world uses for ease of checkout for guests, well there was no check out feature.

trip_advisor,"We stayed at this Hotel in February 2010. The room was great we had purchased it at a raffel at work for a fund raiser for United Way. So we probably paid more then we needed but it was for charity. We were woke up at 3:00am in the morning by a group of at least 25 young people that were so loud coming off the elevators and down the hall ways they must of woke everyone up on our floor. Of course one of the rooms they rented was right next to ours. They were so loud shouting profanities and banging on the walls that we thought there was maybe a fight going on. We called the front desk who sent security up immediately. Security tried to get the people that were not registered guests to leave. We called down to the front desk two more times to send security back up again since nothing changed this went on for over an hour until it finally quieted down. Because of this we ended up over sleeping in the morning since we were so exhausted. When we complained about it in the morning managemnet would do nothing for us because as they stated we used a gift certificate. Well we still paid for it!!. They would not give us one thing free for the trouble that we had. We would never stay at this hotel again, obviously they really don't care about their guests.",0,nan,ta_n123
trip_advisor,Move beyond the rock theme and it's an average hotel with a good location. Room was unbearably hot and the controls on the wall did nothing. Thank goodness the window opened or we'd have been cooked alive. That of course let in all the noise from Michigan Ave. This combined with our neighbors door slamming against their thrown door lock every 30 seconds made for a lively setting. Room was stuffy too. Burn marks on carpet lead me to believe nasty smokers had occupied room on many occasions. Wife happy w/ Aveda in bath. Base bar was good with great service and well made drinks tho pricey.,0,nan,ta_n124
trip_advisor,"Great building and location, but... staff is indifferent, you have to pay for WiFi (after $300 usd/night I would expect at least free WiFi), no pool in the building and something I found really annoying is that, if you move anything from the minibar, they have sensors that automatically charge you. This is ridicoulus.The iPod dock in the room didn't work. Also, we had to move thenightstand between beds and found dirt all over. Definitely is not value for your money. You're just paying for the Hard Rock brand. I will never go back to a Hard Rock Hotel.",0,nan,ta_n125

The carpet was drenched and stained near the bathroom because the shower (open concept) leaks water onto the floor since there are no doors on it. The mini bar was broken and put an extremely foul scent into the room. Our final hotel bill reflected 2 charges that were incorrect....1 for the mini bar which we did not utilize, and the second was an up charge for a bottle of wine ($69 instead of $50). When my husband went to the front desk to have it corrected, he was met with a very unfriendly and unapologetic employee. It was adjusted, but not without confrontation. There was another guest checking out when my husband was at the front desk who had the same ""mysterious"" mini bar charge on her bill as well, and was trying to have it corrected. Overall, the location of the Hard Rock was nice but it will be the last time that we stay in one,",0,nan,ta_n127
trip_advisor,"I chose this hotel for a nice weekend getaway and was nothing but disappointed. The previous weekend, I stayed at a 2.5 star hotel a few blocks away, and was much more impressed there. The Hard Rock had a number of issues including: very dark room - not much light (artificial or natural); lots of street noise; very cheap decor and furniture; broken cabinet door; very warm room - said they would send maintenance, but they never arrived; had bar charges on account that were not ours. Overall, I was very surprised that this was a 4 star hotel. I expected a much better experience!",0,nan,ta_n128
trip_advisor,"This morning, I checked out and left behind one of the worst hotel experiences I've ever had: Hard Rock Hotel, Chicago. I am in disbelief that this hotel is part of the ""Preferred Hotels"" group. Upon checking in, I was ""greeted"" by a front desk staff that had better things to be doing and let it show. My room was poorly lit and dirty. The desk/desk chair was covered in sticky, dried soda pop (or something else?) which I had to clean myself so I could work. The ""sound system"" was put to shame by my 10-year-old daughter's boombox. No one, rock star or otherwise, wants to reach more than an arm's length for toilet paper. Everything is possible. This includes hiring professional and courteous staff to answer customer calls that are directed to the ""everything is possible"" line. Great marketing fails with no follow through. The in-room mini-bar policy ranks in my personal top-five most ridiculous business practices of all time. Do you charge Steven Tyler $7.81 for opening his in-room 'fridge? Looking back, I would have much preferred enjoying cocktails in my dirty room rather than the dirty, drafty, overpriced bar (with a horrendous wine list) With the exception of the fact that I was leaving, check-out was no better than checking in. I wasn't even asked about my stay! The young woman who provided me with a copy of my bill could not have been more unpleasant. I, for one, will not bring my business back to that location. Next time I'm in Chicago, I'm staying at the Hyatt. Rock on, TripStarr",0,nan,ta_n129

We lifted our blanket and found very distubing spotting on our bed (attached in photos), we immediatly called the front desk. The only thing they offered was a new set of sheets. when the room service men came to change the sheets he brought us another one with a big red stain on it and quickly/hid changed it before we seen it and he apologized and offered to bring us new ones once again. we denied since it was so late and just slept on the sheets the appeared to be clean. Then next day i eagerly showed the fronk desk and manager the photos, and they offered me a ($68) refund. I was very dissapointed,and dirty sheets that made us very uncomfortable and sleepless and I broke out on my face with ACNE (i never had a acne or skin issues) im positive something in those dirtyy sheets. We drove 4.5 hours to enjoy Chicago and we stayed @ the hard rock based on reputatuion, and unfortunitly we were very disspointed. it was DISGUSTING!

Don't mistakingly think the Hard Rock Cafe is there, it isn't. They have a Chinese restaurant that is overpriced and limited on items. The room service menu is broken down in terms of times you can order certain foods. When my wife wanted a milk shake we had to call the Manager to have it made since the kitchen staff said it wasn't a choice. The Rolled Roast beef sandwich was listed under the 2 am choice and they refused to make it untill again, we called the Manager who did get it to us. The staff did appear friendly, although housekeeping totally disregarded our 'do not disturb' sign and would call us on the phone. Don't make the mistake of staying here but if you do, walk across the street and buy snacks you want because even a soda is $3 plus 19% gratuity.

It was very hard to do my makeup or read because of the lighting. The location is OK. You have to walk a few blocks to get to the best part of Michigan Ave, but its not too bad. Be prepared for some sad sights after dark. Apparently panhandling is permitted in Chicago ( some cities will give you a ticket for begging) because at night, the beggars come out. The saddest thing i saw was an older woman with her two grandkids sitting on a curb in the freezing snow on a -5 temp night. Those kids looked terrible. Unfortunatly its all up and down the wealthiest part of the city. You don't see so many in the daylight. Also the room service at the Hard Rock is pretty good. Its plenty for 2 people.

Here's the skinny, if you're hoping to run into a washed up rock star (CeCe Deville for us, and no the teenagers had no idea who he was) you may want to spend your hard earned money here. I took my younger sister and a couple of her friends (teenagers) for an overnighter in Chicago on our way to Wisconsin. I chose the Hard Rock for the ambiance. I mean come on it is supposed to be ""COOL"". Well it wasn't. The Positives: *It is in the Carbon & Carbide Building, which is beautiful. *The location: it sits in the middle of everything *The lobby has two computers for guest use. *The fitness center is very nice. Cardio machines have individual TV's and there are head phones in case you forgot yours. They have protein bars for those that like them for a post workout snack. *Check-in and out was quick and Valet was very courteous. The Negatives: *The rooms were small and ours wasn't clean (pistachio shells on the floor). The rooms were painted purplish gray (we were on the Prince floor) with a picture of Bob Marley hanging on one of the walls. The girls thought the coolest part about the hotel was the fuzzy throw pillows. *Bathroom had only a shower and not a full tub. *The cable reception was poor; I kept looking for the bunny ears to fix the picture. *It isn't anywhere near the Hard Rock Cafe. *There was very little memorabilia. *There is no pool, and yes I knew this when I made the reservation. To wrap it up, I won't be staying here again. If I am going to drop almost 4 Benjamins on a hotel room, I will stay at the Palmer House Hilton. But that is a whole different review.",0,nan,ta_n133

Our friends later (on 2/16) asked us if we had received the strawberries, and we responded no. They then brought this to the attention of the hotel and we were pleasantly surprised to have received a complimentary bottle of champagne. We were then disappointed again, upon checking out, however, when we were accidentally billed for the ""complimentary"" champagne - which was later subtracted from our bill. The in-room DVD player didn't work. It was approximately 11 PM on 2/15 when we called the front desk for help with trouble-shooting the issue. The person responded friendly that ""Al, the engineer, will be calling you back shortly"" to help. 10 minutes later there was a knock on the door, and it was Al. A great and friendly guy, but we were waiting for a call back, not the arrival of a service tech - keep in mind it was late and we were already in bed. When Al was not able to fix the DVD player, he graciously told us ""order a movie on us"" - thru the in-house movie selection. The problem: that didn't work either. Again, Al was awesome, and called the service provider, but they weren't able to fix it until after midnight. Finally, after midnight Al called us back, but by then the ""movie watching"" mood had sort of passed. I ended up watching the film ""Hitman"" alone as my wife had already gone to sleep.The thermostat in our room didn't work, regardless of the temperature we set it to (set to 65 degrees - actual temperature = 76 degrees).

trip_advisor,"This is a tough one to review... as the star ratings were from 1 star to 5 and had to figure out an average.... 2 is where it was. Here are my tips and props/complaints: Room: 1 Star. I had a corner suite. The room was pretty nasty actually (2703..STAY AWAY FROM IT!!!). There was a CONSTANT banging noise from above. When I first got in I thought it was the person above me bumping and grinding. After an hour, I knew even if it was someone high on speed and redbull would not be going that strong. Well, the sound continued on for 3 days. Not that I minded too much as I keep things on for white noise... but it sure would bug others. Also, there were about 10 cig burns on the carpet and sofa. In addition, it looked like someone left the iron on the sofa. Also, there is a gray furry pillow on the bed that looks like a big dead rat. I could not imagine all the DNA left on that thing either. *gags* Bathroom: Nice size but not great. The faucet was lose (really lose) and the toilet would not flush right. Service: Great. Everyone I encountered did a great job making me feel welcome. Good stuff. Food: I had meetings there, so experienced the breakfast and lunch they made. It was really good... much better than most hotels. Bar: Very cool. Good music, great service and good drinks. The scene was decent as well. Small bar, but was not cramped. So, maybe other rooms are nicer... well hell they better be. Regardless, if ONE room is like that (especially a ""suite""), I have to think others are like that as well. It is too bad though. The views are great and they actually have windows that open... big shocker for the city in general!",0,nan,ta_n135
trip_advisor,"My wife and I just spent the Labor Day weekend in the city, choosing the Hard Rock Hotel as our pad. We've stayed at the HRH in Orlando twice and are blown away by the ambience there. It's not that way here. These may be all ticky tacky things, but they added up to us. First of all, the room. We upgraded our reservation thru the HRH website for a room with ""an Incredible view"". Well, our 9th floor view was of nothing more than the venting on top of the building next to us. That was all we could see. So there was no view. The room was muggy. We had the air turned down all the way and it never got below 74. We woke up sweaty both days. When we opened the window to get a breeze, the noise from the rooftop next to us was overbearing. The room was small and dark, but it didn't bother us that much. The bed may have been the mosr comfortable bed I ever slept in. And we even joked about stealing the pillows! We had the same issue with the honor bar as a previous poster, but they removed the charges no prob. Throughout the entire hotel, I counted a total of 3 pieces of music memorabilia. I thought it was a pretty cheesy attempt to renovate an old hotel, throw a Styx guitar on the wall, and slap a HRH emblem on the outside. The hotel itself was very clean and did not look like a renovation. The location is good, right on the south end of the mag mile, but there are 10-15 better hotels in a better location to shopping, quality eats, and Navy Pier. If you have a car, parking will cost you $38/day, which is prob normal for downtown. The hotel restaurant was a Chinese restaurant. The bar was small and trendy, and I guess the kicker to it all was that my wife tried to order a Pina Colada and they told us they didn't have a blender. WHAAT???? A HRH without a blender? Did they not know that Jimmy Buffet was in town???? Mind blowing! I would never, never, never go back here. Like I said, there are many better hotels in much better locations.

I told the customer service rep that I had never heard of such a practice, but she said, in a very smug manner, that I was told back in January. I honestly don't remember being told of the cancellation policy, but think it is a unprofessional practice to capture some additional dollars since it is not an industry standard to require a seven day cancellation policy when you book directly with the hotel.

Before I arrived I tried to find out about the ""In Room Fitness"" program advertised on the corporate website. I called the 800 reservation number and the client service representative answered that the hotel did have a fitness center. I explained that I was inquiring about the 'In Room Fitness' advertised on their website. She put me on hold and came back a few minutes later and told me that there was no such thing and that I should call the property directly. I did and got the same response. I asked if they could reserve a treadmill for my room. Again, this was a problem. When I arrived at the hotel, no treadmill was available. When I went to tour the fitness room the first night I found that they close at 9pm. When I returned to the center the next day I discovered that they charge $13 per day to use the fitness equipment. The pool, track and locker room are free, but to use the treadmills, etc. you have to pay $13 per day. This charge is not noted anywhere -- not on the website, not in any of the guest service materials in the room. The food for the conference was mediocre, but the one room service meal I had was pretty good. During one of the conference lunch sessions the wait staff made so much noise we couldn't hear the speaker. The HVAC didn't work well in my room and I kept the windows open for most of my three night stay. The beds were comfortable with very nice linens. I tried to get a late checkout, which was offered on a card in my room. The woman who answered the phone would only give me an hour, not the 11-2pm range advertised in my room. The best service I received was from the folks in the Security office. The hotel does not have safes in guest rooms, so I became very friendly with Security office as I locked up my laptop between conference sessions and every other time I couldn't carry it out of the hotel.

We could hear a lot of the street noise, which made for a hard night's sleep, not to mention worrying about insects even after changing rooms. For $400 a night after tax, I strongly encourage you to check for alternatives.",0,nan,ta_n147
trip_advisor,"I stayed at the Hilton Chicago last week and was very disappointed. The highlight of the stay was waiting 20 minutes for a bellman to come and get our luggage. Finally, my 72 year old mother, 8 year old son, and myself gave up and dragged it all down to valet parking ourselves - no easy task. The security guard was kind enough to hold the door for me. The valet parking attendants looked over and then ignored us. As far as I could tell, he was just standing there doing nothing. I couldn't let go of the bags without everything falling so I gave my son the parking receipt. The attendant pointed to where our car was parked - no short distance away. My 8 year old had to tell him to pull it up. They should have been ashamed. Less significant, but irritating issues. The pool is part of the Hilton Athletic club. Two lanes are reserved for adults wanting to lap swim. Basically, two adults can take up 2/3rds of the pool while everyone else is consigned to the leftover 1/3rd. This is ridiculous and very family unfriendly. In addition, the pool closes at 9 p.m. What pool closes at 9? We stayed for 3 nights. Not one single additional bar of soap, bottle of shampoo, or coffee stirrers.",0,nan,ta_n148
trip_advisor,"I stayed at the Hilton Chicago because I was attending a conference at the hotel. The room was sufficient - had a coffee maker, bed, hangers, tv, etc. That's about where my compliments end: *restaurant rates are outrageous. $21 for a breakfast buffet? $25 to use the gym? $7.50/hr for WiFi!?!?! This is unacceptable when I'm paying $249 per night. Thank goodness the ice was free. *servers in the restaurant and bar were surly, not well-versed in English, and just rude. *computer monitors in rooms are silly and turn on at random times during the night *conference was incredibly cold...everybody was wearing their overcoats the entire time, despite our complaints to management. *fridge in room was not usable. had to store cold items in the ice bucket. *Cable channels just flat out SUCKED.

At the Hilton, one is charged for Internet access on each device per hour. (We stayed in the middle of Ohio and received total access for free.) We didn't drink the $6.00 water or try the $28. Breakfast buffet. The staff was friendly, but of course you tip for a smile. They did give us a cot for free as we had asked for a room with a fold-out couch as we were a party of 5.

trip_advisor,"Months prior to my 5-night reservation with the Hilton Chicago I requested a room that allowed in a lot of natural light, facing an open view, not a close building. (The reservation was made through a conference travel agency.) I confirmed my request by telephone a few days in advance directly with the hotel and at check-in the clerk noted it in my record. She told me it would be difficult to find, but consulted a chart and appeared to be satisfied with the room she assigned me. I was very surprised to open the door onto a room on the inside of one of the towers, tucked into a very dark corner, facing a wall of rooms. I called the desk immediately and was told that the hotel was sold out and it was hard to tell what rooms were still available that suited my request, but to ""sit tight"" and someone would call me. No one did. Further calls yielded similar results. At one point I was told I could have a ""parlor room,"" with a sofa bed, at a reduced rate, but I could not go see the room before committing to moving. That's real hospitality for you. Worried that a bad sofa bed could be worse than rooming in a cave, I ended up staying in the dreadfully dark room. (I had asked for a bright room with one bed and got a dark room with two beds.) The only redeeming feature of the room was that it had 2 bathrooms. Other than that, it was tight quarters with a tiny closet, two uncomfortably low chairs, at the desk and in a (dark) corner. Light fixtures didn't do much to brighten things up. Since I was here at a conference, I really wanted a bright environment to wake up early and start the workday in and to have as a cheerful office for mid-day calls and e-mail, but instead I got a cave. Consequently, I spent as little time as possible in the room and next time I am in Chicago, conference or not, I will absolutely stay at another hotel. There are much better locations that the Hilton Chicago and looking at the percentage of ""inside tower"" rooms, places with a much better chance of having a bright room as well as better customer service. Shame on the Chicago Hilton.",0,nan,ta_n151
trip_advisor,I recently stayed here for the Chicago triathlon. This was my third stay at this hotel. I have not had any issues until this visit. After the 3rd day of my stay I requested my room to be serviced and returned to what I thought was a clean room. While getting out of bed I was cut by a piece of glass in the carpet. I must not have been the first person to be cut in the room because I found dried blood on the bathroom floor afterwards. I had not noticed it before so I was very disgusted. We notified the staff and asked that the room be vacuumed and the bathroom mopped. We returned to the room after 5pm to find that the dried blood was still on the floor. After making a complaint to the customer service I have gotten no reply from the hotel. Considering the price point of this downtown hotel I would think that they would try to live up the 5 star rating but instead they have failed miserably. Luckily there are many hotels to choose from in downtown Chicago.,0,nan,ta_n152

I pretty much only stay at Hilton properties and have stayed at tons from Hawaii all the way to Budapest. This Hilton is not up to par. It's clean and the front desk staff is nice, but in Chicago, The Drake, Doubletree Guest Suites, and even the Hilton Garden Inn are all superior to the Chicago Hilton (and less expensive). Compared to other Hilton properties in Chicago, the rooms were not as well appointed, the bathrooms in the rooms were smaller and not as nice, the TV was tiny, the hallways on the executive floor were very noisy all night long, and the breakfast you get was more like a Hampton Inn than a 4 star hotel. If you're going to Chicago and you like Hilton brand hotels, you can do far better than this place.",0,nan,ta_n154
trip_advisor,"My sister and I stayed on the 22nd floor, there was a refrigerator in the hallway for the first three nights, beat up and old dorm style. It was not until we told the concierge that we were going to post the picture we took of it on Tripadvisor did the thing get removed. Breakfast dishes left outside rooms will stay on the floor for a day or two routinely. All night there are chimes that make noise, that are supposed to be comformting or relaxing and rather they are just annoying. There is no wifi - no matter what they tell you, I paid for the wifi, and still we were unable to get on. Lastly, my sister and I split the bill, I had already paid for the first night in form of a deposit and they gave her the credit. Room cost with city taxes etc. was 313.69 a night. I know the Comfort Inn just a few blocks away is significantly cheaper! So while the View was wonderful, it is NOT worth the money.",0,nan,ta_n155

trip_advisor,"It's not a bad hotel. It's just so...disappointing. As a Diamond member, I expect slightly more than a room with two double beds with no view. I'm not distraught over this, but come on. Ditto the continental breakfast in the executive lounge, which has nothing but fattening pastries, bagels and cereal. Low-level Hampton Inns have a free breakfast that puts this to shame. And what's with the lounge not opening until 6:30am? Business travelers often need to be GONE by 6:30, not sitting down to their meager breakfast. The in-room wifi is a pain to access, and I somehow got stuck with the $19.99 plan even though I selected the basic plan. (Don't get me started on how a $89/night Hampton Inn can offer free wifi and a full-service Hilton & Towers seemingly can't...). Finally, what's with the two bathrooms per one hotel room? It's an unseemly waste of space, especially when the rooms are so meager. And the gold-plated bathroom fixtures scream 1992, not 2009, as does the picture-tube TV (vs. flat panel). Overall, this is a huge disappointment over which Conrad should be ashamed.",0,nan,ta_n158
trip_advisor,"Had a week long stay at the Hilton on south Michigan while attending a meeting. The hotel has some elegance in the lobby, meeting rooms and lounges - the hotel rooms could definitely use updating. I would definitely say that for the price of a room here - the rooms should be top notch. My car was misplaced during valet parking, our reservations were messed up, hotel staff showed up repeatedly throughout the week at our door with items (room service, a new coffee pot, laundry) that wasn't ours. I would not stay at this property again.

Have spent a lot of nights in other Homewood suites hotels and other suite hotels. Thought the room was ok, not great. Overpriced in my opinion. Found staff to be uninterested and not very helpful. Had to wait in the lobby on the 6th floor for room to be ready and the front desk staff could care less. Watched during the week as other guests were made to wait as well. Breakfast was the same stuff day after day. As the week went on, they actually started to run out of the more popular food items and these were not replenished (weekly delivery I guess). Also, the room was was so busy that the staff made people wait for a table and treated you as you were waiting for a 5 star restaurant. Travel for work (sales) and frequently stay in hotels. Travel with family every year and also stay in hotels. This is roughing it for me...not a camper. Would come to Chicago again, but would not stay here. There are too many other options worth investigating.",0,nan,ta_n160

Rooms are from the same cookie cutter as all Homewood Suites - very utilitarian; unlike many locations however, this one does not include a DVD player in the rooms.

The front desk person was not in a good mood and I couldn't wait to leave the lobby. Having not traveled here before we were looking for exciting places to eat and to go sightseeing. We asked multiple staff members at the front desk of places to go and see and never got any good recommendations. We felt as if we were an inconvenience to the staff. At one point, the front desk person was on the phone while we were waiting to talk to her, as she was on the phone a family of four came up behind us waiting to talk to her as well. Even though she saw us standing there, after she finished with the phone call she ignored us and helped the family first. Yes, we are in our mid 20's, but we are still paying guests and there is no reason to be treated like we are invisible. For how much money we paid for each night, I would have rather stayed somewhere else.

Well, when we arrived, it was apparent that there was chaos do to one of two elevators being out of service (which it had been since Tuesday, this was Saturday). Once we finally got to the 6th floor to check in, I figured our relaxing time had begun. Well, we got our room key and headed for the17th floor. Again, waited for an elevator but finally made it two our room. I put the key in the door it opened to the surprise of me and the family already inside the room - Yup we got double booked. The family was very nice and seemed OK with their surprise visitors. Said our apologies and went back to the elevator and waited again to head back down to the 6th floor registration to figure the mess out. We have now been at the hotel for a half hour with no room and slightly annoyed. Made it to the reservation desk and explained the situation. I did get an apology and a new room. New key in hand waited AGAIN for an elevator to bring us to the 9th floor for a new room. FINALLY got to our room only to find it was a king suite. We are a family of four including two full grown teenage boys. There was no way they were going to fit on a pull out sofa. So, REALLY annoyed now, I called the front desk and was told that were no rooms with two beds left even though I had specifically asked for two beds when I booked. It said two beds on preference on my reservation but the reservation agent assured me two beds would be available when I checked in. She went so far to but TWO BEDS on my reservation paper work. The operator said there are is only one two bed room on each floor. The only thing we got was a fold up bed that took away half the room in the living area. Now, I paid a total of 349.00 for one night for this room. We got the mess mentioned above and a breakfast out of the deal. I am pretty sure my next trip to Chicago will not include this hotel.

trip_advisor,"This review has two parts. . .I advise reading both. Chapter One: The actual hotel and staff I found the in house staff to be very friendly and accommodating. The room was nice and clean as well. I have no disagreement with any of the other reviews regarding the hotel room or the staff. This is a great location where you can walk three blocks to to the South to reach the riverfront, or a few blocks to reach the water tower to the North. Very easy (one block) walk from the subway (Red line). The morning complimentary breakfast is substantial. Not just muffins and coffee. You can have a complete breakfast here if you want. And, even the breakfast servers were really nice and efficient. I would recommend this hotel IF based solely on the physical location, the room, and the staff. Chapter Two: The nightmare I booked this room through central reservations in July for a mid-September arrival. The rate was quoted to me as $159 per night for four nights. When the confirmation was emailed to me, it was incorrect by over $300. I immediately called the hotel. They said they made the correction and emailed a new confirmation with the correct amount. I did receive the corrected confirmation email. . .All done? NO. One week later, my credit card statement arrives with the old higher amount having been charged. I called the hotel and was transferred to central reservations to resolve. When I explained the error, I was literally called a liar by the person in reservations, and told ""That's not my problem. I can't help you"". . . and then told that I have to pay the higher amount. Excuse ME? Now, I go back to calling the hotel manager to get some assistance. After a few left messages, I get the general manager to call me back, and discuss the issue. After taking down all of the names of people I spoke with, he assures me that he will credit the account immediately. I even get a call from someone in his accounting dept to confirm my credit card etc. . . One week later, still no credit. So, I call the general manager again. Oh, this might take up to 72 hours to process, I am told. So, please give it another week. Another week passes, still no credit. So another call to the manager. I am told now that the credit HAS been processed, and he even sends me an email confirming our ""agreement"" for the credit, just to appease me. Another week passes. Still, not seeing that credit that was ""definitely processed"" a week ago. Yet another call to the general manager on the day before I am to leave on my trip to Chicago. I told him I will be arriving, and at this point, I want to see him personally, and he can physically use my credit card to process the credit while I am there. Remember, we are now talking SIX WEEKS and this is still not resolved. I arrive at the hotel, and to make a long story short, the general manager was NEVER available to see me, nor did he make any attempts to schedule any time to see or talk with me. The only person I spoke face to face with, was the assistant general manager. He was completely unconcerned with my situation, and made the completely inappropriate statement to me of ""you realize this boils down to a matter of 'he said she said'"". . . WHAT???? Today, my trip is over, and I have flown back home. I STILL HAVE NOT RECEIVED THE CREDIT TO MY ACCOUNT!!! I will absolutely be reporting all of this to Hilton Corporate Customer Service, and will absolutely be disputing the entire amount at this point.

Second day my diamond earrings came up missing. Noticed they were missing while in the packing up and checking out process. My biggest mistake was not staying there and dealing with this further. But we had a family reunion and funeral to get to. While the front desk was great and said they would handle it, I believe they say these things just to get you to go on about your way! We filed a police report and the GM of the hotel is supposed to be working on it. We have called several times but receive no answers. They keep telling us the cleaning staff have been there 10 + years.....that dosen't matter to me! If they are not held accountable what's to stop them from taking anything. There is a dishwasher in the room, and they found my daughters ring (which was in the same glass with my diamond earrings) in the dishwasher. They say I put the cup in the dishwasher. First, I am on vacation, trust me i'm NOT doing dishes! Second, why would I wash one glass and leave the other dirty dishes in the room? So, while it is a nice hotel....lock up your things of value!

After giving him our name, the manager said,""OK, we have your king smoking suite available"". We quickly corrected him to let him know that we were traveling with two very young kids and we reserved a non-smoking room. He insisted that his computer said that we reserved a smoking room. We went back and forth, then he asked us if we had a copy of our reservation. Luckily, we were able to pull the reservation up on our phone. It clearly said non-smoking. After showing him our reservation, he explained that there was nothing that he could do to correct the situation because they had no other rooms available. So why in the world did he need to see our reservation!! We decided to see if we could handle the smoking room. It turns out that the entire floor was smoking and for a non smoker there was no way that we could sleep in a smoking room on a smoking floor with our two young children. The manager eventually called around and found a hampton inn near by with one bed. We canceled our room reservation. We live about an hour away from downtown so we made the late night trip back home. My family was very disappointed. My husband is a gold member with Hilton. Let's just say we will be switching back to Marriott. The hotel lobby was dated.

Well, our stay here lasted 1 night and we quickly, and thankfully, switched to a different hotel for our last 4 nights. The room was dirty. When we opened the sofabed, the sheets were filthy and there was a mess of dirt and crumbs that fell out. Ridiculous considering this is a suite hotel where the sofabeds are likely used, and theoretically cleaned, a lot. Extra blankets were also dirty and bathrooms weren't much better. Temperature control in the room was imprecise - minor inconvenience but without clean blankets on our only night, it made for a cold stay. If you like to eat for free (they have free breakfasts and dinner on certain nights) and don't care to eat the great food Chicago has to offer, I guess some may find this place tolerable. But we found the buffet no better than average and felt like we were at a Golden Corral.

After getting stared at for the first 15-20 minutes, an employee came and told us that we wernt allowed to eat breakfast without our shoes on. Remind you, it was about 15-20 minutes after we had even entered the room. So she asked that we go get shoes while sitting down and eating our breakfast. Pretty pointless AFTER we already had gotten our food. I am sure it is because very few employees could speak understandable english that it took so long.

Location was more of a business district, not appropriate for pleasure trip. Employees of Hyatt were very friendly and helpful, other than the failure to deliver the reserved room.",0,nan,ta_n180
trip_advisor,"The room was dingy and run down - it felt like staying in a cheap motel. The carpet was exceptionally worn, wallpaper peeling, bathroom grout dingy. The place felt like it hadn't been redecorated in 30 years. On top of that, the windows would not open (not unusual for a hig-rise hotel), and there was no air fan for ac or heat - how the temp control was supposed to work, I have no idea (they said 'radient cooling' whatever that is), but we had to call down to the front desk and ask for a floor fan to cool the room and have some air circulation. We even went so far as to prop the door open and put the fan in the fan in the door while we were in the room to not feel suffocated. So much for privacy. I can't comment on the food, because we ate out at every chance. Chicago has some fantastic food! And much of it within easy distance to the hotel. The hotel is in a good location, near the waterfront and millenium park, shopping and dining. The conference facilities were average, but frustrating because they were in the basement and cell phone reception was non-existent. I will never stay in this hotel again, especially for the price, because of the poor room quality.",0,nan,ta_n181
trip_advisor,"First let me say, I try not to be too critical, but in some cases the truth is warranted! We checked in and things seemed fine. Location was excellent. Woke up the first morning, to a slightly rumpled bed covered in ""stains"", I hope-filthy and not 4 star hotel quality. Requested a linen change and heard a knock on the door- a gentleman was there to let me know if I wanted it done to take off the privacy sign, I did and no one even came until later in the day. The room was big enough, had no drawers, suposedly remodeled but carpet didn't reach the wall, toilet paper holder fell off constantly and shower head was broken. The mirrors were great and the water was always hot! The walls were paper thin, I heard every conversation the guests next door had. They were not noisy but you could hear everything including the t.v. through the walls and vents. Internet was $13.00, worked for a bit and then not again, I called customer service and spent 25 minutes on the phone and they asked if they could work on resetting the system and call back later. The hotel did give us a credit for the charges. At this point, enough was enough, we packed our bags and checked out. The front desk was very helpful- kudos to Rocco for caring and being the only friendly staff we saw other than the bell hops!!",0,nan,ta_n182
trip_advisor,"My expectations were not high because I booked this hotel through priceline for $58 / night. An amazing deal if not for the fact that you had to wait 15 - 20 minutes for hot water. I called the front desk to tell them that there was no hot water - to which they nonchalantly replied: ""try running it for 15 to 20 minutes."" They forgot to tell me to keep the water running after my shower, if anyone else expected to use the shower. My boyfriend, who showered after me, had to wait another 10 minutes to get the shower warm again. To make matters worse, after room service was delivered, we called and said we needed another fork. They told us it would cost $3 ($1 for the fork, $2 for delivey charge). Absolutely ridiculous!! At least with a 1 star hotel, you get hot water. This is supposed to be a 4 star hotel. I guess you do get what you paid for - I just feel bad for the people who actually paid full price.",0,nan,ta_n183
trip_advisor,"Thank god I got this hotel through priceline. I can't imagine paying full price for this place. The tub was moldy and dingy. The toilet didn't flush. Their selection of TV channels was limited to say the least. Unless you wanted to pay $5 for a rerun of an NBC show. Oh, and internet? Why that will set you back about $15 for the day. And breakfast? That's about $16 for a cup of coffee, a croissant and two slices of honeydew. This hotel is the pits. The customer service is....absent! When you walk in to the ridiculous lobby (decked out like some bad late 80's prom) there's no one to direct you upstairs to the check in. And once you're there, check in is very fast, i'll grant them that. This hotel is a big, crummy rip-off. I will never stay here (and will steer clear of Hyatts in general I believe).",0,nan,ta_n184
trip_advisor,"The lines at the check in desk were tremendously long so we decided to use the computerized self check in. The only option the self check in gave us was the size of the bed. When we got to our room, we immediately realized we were placed in a smoking room but we were unable or perhaps the staff was unwilling to move us to a non smoking room. I am allergic to the smoke and that made my stay uncomfortable. The walls seemed thin and we could clearly hear the conversations of the guests in the rooms next to us. When we went to breakfast, we were seated quickly but it was nearly ten minutes before our server arrived. For the price they were charging, the wait was unacceptable and we went elsewhere. It also took ten extra minutes than promised for the valet to get our car. For forty dollars a day for parking, we expected better.",0,nan,ta_n185
trip_advisor,"The Chicago Hyatt Regency deceptively alters the cancellation policy by charging the full room rate upon cancellation--ie the room cannot be cancelled. I recently booked over the phone a one night stay directly with the hotel. The reservation specialist mentioned over the phone there was a 72-hour cancellation policy. However, when I tried to cancel the reservation within that timeframe, Robert, the reservation supervisor, said that the room could not be cancelled at any time without charging full price for the room. He said that I should refer to the confirmation e-mail that states at the bottom that prepayment is required at time of booking / non-refunable. This clearly was not what was agreed to over the phone. I told him to cancel without being charged. In response, he threatened to cancel and charge me for the full stay. Why would someone cancel if they are going to be charged full price?

When they finally came up about 30 people filed out of that room only to file right back in after about 10 minutes. When we called back nothing was done about it. My 2 year old son was awaken by all the loud music and cursing. THEN we get up the next morning at 7:30 to get ready only to find that we have no running water. After the maintenance man piddles around with it for a half hour we have no time to shower and have to ride the two hour train ride dirty and tired from no sleep. They did not resolve this issue. They just keep passing my complaint to ""managers"" supposedly. It was the worst stay of my life and my poor two year old had to be there for it",0,nan,ta_n188
trip_advisor,"THE ROOM I booked a room here and was told I'd be getting a king bed. When I check in, they say they only have a queen bed room available. I protested to no avail. When I got to the room, it was really only a full size bed. So I went from from a king bed at home to a full size bed in a tiny broom closet of a room in Chicago. For the pleasure, I paid the same price as a normal king bed room. The full size bed we had was also extremely uncomfortable. I think it was lop sided because they never rotate the mattresses. We would wake up with body aches and headaches. My wife even said she lost feeling in her arms some nights. Not good. Also, the internet in the room is hard to set-up, slow to use, and inconsistent. I generally had to restart my computer at least once to get the internet to work. The internet worked one day on my iPhone and then would not log me in. It's not really worth it. ROOM SERVICE Room service was very inconsistent and nonsensical. Some mornings they would take our towels (even the ones we hung up to use again) and not replace them, other times they would replace some towels and not others. They would also come at vastly different times. HOTEL SERVICE This hotel LOVES to nickel and dime. I asked for a fridge in the room and they told me it'd be $25. No other hotel I've ever stayed in (regardless of how many stars it had) has ever charged me for a fridge in the room. Late checkout? charge. Shuttle from the airport? - nonexistent. The front deck ""gold passport"" people can't even figure out how to get you points. In the end I will have to call corporate and get my points for my stay (not that i plan on staying at a Hyatt property again). By the way, apparently the hotel is still undergoing changes because my mini-bar was missing. I was thinking of using it as a fridge instead of paying $25. THE HOTEL The hotel has some cool bars and a beautiful lobby area in the east tower. The west tower has some underground amenities no one uses. The bars are extremely expensive, but the drinks are tasty. The food is edible too, but I wouldn't brag about it. The hotel is not directly on the main street (Michigan), but it's not too far from it. It's right next to the boat tours and, in some rooms, has a view of the Navy Pier. Our room faced another hotel, but we could see a sliver of the pier. The hotel is walking distance from Millennium Park. It's a bit of a walk to any of the L stations though. If you want a wonderful breakfast place, go to Wildberry on Randolph st. It'll have you waiting to eat for a long time, but it's yummy! CONCLUSION I get better rooms, better beds, better service, and better amenities at a Holiday Inn Express or a Best Western. Save the money and stay elsewhere.",0,nan,ta_n189
trip_advisor,"The room was very spacious with very nice, colorful decorating. The beds felt like lying on a cloud, and there were four pillows on each bed, two fiberfill and two down so you could choose which you like better. The bathroom was very nice also. Overall, I was very pleased with the stay. You had to show your room key to get in after ten p.m. I thought that was a good security issue. It has a great location too, close to downtown. I would recommend it. The decorations were very classy. Most hotels have two of the same framed art, boring bedspreads and lumpy pillows. The Hyatt Regency was just the opposite.",0,nan,ta_n190
trip_advisor,"My family and I stayed at the Hyatt on Wacker Dr. on March 27, 2012. We were excited about the great price we got for your 4-star hotel through priceline. Unfortunately, we were not impressed. In the past, we have stayed at the Hyatt in downtown San Diego for spring break on the Marina, but chose to stay closer to home this year. The room was not clean to our standards when we arrived, even though we paid for an upgrade. We asked for it to be cleaned while we were sight seeing and were assured it would be looked after. Upon our return, nothing had been moved in the room to re-clean including the tea my sons had made prior to our excursion so I can only assume, it wasn't even checked as promised. We only had 3 towels for the 4 of us and had to call for more. They were promptly delivered but room service took 40 + minutes to deliver us a knife and corkscrew we essentially paid for because we felt compelled to tip even though we had to call and ask for it twice! The curtains were dirty and frayed by the vacuuming, the bed skirt had a foreign stain on it, the honor bar/fridge was gouged and dirty, too! The mirror was dirty and the beds appeared to have been jumped on - not neat and tidy at all....There were boxes of trash in the hall and an old refrigerator or two as well. Very disappointing to say the least. I have buyer's remorse and wish we had just taken the train home and stayed in our own beds! We were compensated for our upgrade - $20.00 but given the price of parking, taxes, and etc. at this point I wouldn't recommend this Hyatt to anyone. My husband travels and uses his Hyatt business travel points quite often and also expected better from your 4-star hotel. I felt compelled to let you know how unhappy we were with your facility.",0,nan,ta_n191
trip_advisor,"This was the 2nd time that we have stayed at the Hyatt Regency Chicago. The first time was far above our expectations for a $69/per night room. The rooms are very nice, and the beds are comfortable. This time we got a great rate through travelzoo @ $104/ night for a room with a view. We were aware of the $41 parking per night. The first night we got there the valet was yelling at us and said that we couldn't park they were full. We had no clue where to park at this point and had to drive around for over 45 minutes looking at closed parking garages. (It was a Saturday evening) Finally found a spot and were told that it would be $38. This was 6 blocks from the hotel. Mind you its -6 outside and we have luggage to carry too. Not very good service for a 5-star hotel. We got inside and apparently they were running a nightclub out of thier lobby, its called the harddrive. That's cool and all, yes it was very noisy but once we got to our room, it wasn't an issue. The HVAC controls to our room were broken. The first night we were ok, but by the second night it was blazing hot in there, 86 degrees. So hot we couldn't sleep. It was miserable. They sent up the ""engineer"" and he determined that there was definately a problem and opened our window, 24 floors up. It never did cool down enough in there we kept that window open all night. It was 5 below that night and the window being open 8"" didn't help. They would not put us in another room either. At checkout, Monday morning, our bill came to $240.43 after taxes for the room. We then had a second bill in which our internet and parking was billed on for $56.65. Cool, I got my reciepts and went on our way. On Wednesday I was on my online banking checking my account, to find that Hyatt charged me $289.03 and another charge of $103.63!!! That is almost $100 more than what the reciepts from checkout say. I was furious, so I called the hotel. Nothing was resolved by my phone call, they treated me as if $100 isn't but something you wipe with. She said give it another day or two and see if the additional authorization falls off. That didn't settle well with me, but what could I do. I waited. Its Friday now. I check on my account again and the charges cleared as they should have with the correct original amounts, and they still have ""authorizations"" on the two incorrect amounts as well. They have charged me an additional $300!!!!!! Im so furious! and guess what... Hyatt doesn't care. They gave me the same [--] line as they did Wednesday.

Our room was close to being 4 stars; however, fell a little short. It really is time for a remodel of the bathroom. The toilet was of an older and flawed design where you had to close the lid to flush. I'm not a germ freak or anything; however, I really don't want to have to constantly have to touch anything on a toilet if I don't have to. The hotel was fully booked with a teen convention (FCCLA) and unfortunately for anyone else we all suffered for it. The noise at night from every direction. The only way to describe it was as if every room around us was having a slumber party. Coming back from dinner one night it took twenty minutes for us to get to our room due to the traffic. With little to no supervision the kids would cut in line to get on the elevators or they would jump floors not to mention having teens going floor to floor to visit with one another, absolutely ridiculous. The lobby of the Hyatt at night was a complete Zoo.

At the price, though, and given the 4 star hotel, we expected better walls. Our room was connected to other rooms on both sides by locked doors. The sound from both rooms came in loud and clear. We heard our one neighbor making business deals on his phone (he clearly wasn't speaking loudly), and the other neighbors up at midnight yelling and screaming when they came back drunk. We asked them to be quiet (I shouldn't have expected that to work with some young drunks) then called security, but they did nothing.

I waited on hold for twenty minutes to ask a concierge where a pharmacy was located. She curtly gave me cross-street names and hung up. Uhhhhh, how do I know which direction to go in???

We returned late that night and I soon realized the room that my friends were in was not the room that I placed my stuff in that afternoon. We went to speak with the front desk. We were met with ""We can't do anything about that right now due to the hour. We will not disrupt the guest staying in the room you say you left your stuff in."" Unacceptable!!! My $1500 laptop and all of the things I brought with me were in that room! Not my mistake! FINALLY, after arguing with the head of security for about 30 minutes, they knocked on the door of the room I had left my belongings in and a lady answered. She was upset and stated she had security take the items from her room in the afternoon. All of my belongings were recovered in the security room; however, all of this hullabaloo could have been avoided had they communicated about the situation! Terrible, terrible customer service.

All of the above has fallen disappointingly by the wayside with a resounding THUD. Let's break it down: Location: I'll concede that it's still great. Get a corner room in the Historic tower higher than the 20th floor with a view of Michigan Ave and/or the river. Its historic and gorgeous pool: Closed indefinitely! When asked when it will re-open, the hotel staff actually said, ""Maybe never."" Its amazing Sunday brunch: Zest is gone, and his been replaced by a very dark Michael Jordan restaurant that takes up much of the lobby and second entrance. (The lobby, by the way, used to be beautiful and open with lots of places to sit. Also no longer...). The food is very bad. Very. Bad. There are so many restaurants in this city. Do yourself a favor and go somewhere else to eat. Its relatively low price compared to comparable hotels: Based on my review of everything else. Go to the Drake, or the Peninsula. Completely worth the extra money... That, or downgrade to the Hilton and get what you expect and pay for... The InterContinental has fallen so low that you pay a higher price than the Hilton, but you get a worse experience! Its exclusive benefits of the ambassador membership: I canceled our membership after this disaster. Part of the membership includes early check-in (granted, when available)... but our room wasn't ready until 6pm. This is obviously after normal check-in. The staff was overwhelmed, and not effective or helpful. I tried to speak with the manager about our room, waited in long line to speak with someone, only to be told that my husband needed to be with me because the membership was in his name.

trip_advisor,"After reading all the lukewarm reviews for this hotel, I went ahead and got an Ambassador membership just to hedge off any unpleasantness. I normally have a good experience with Intercontinental hotels, particularly the Mark Hopkins in SF. I called the hotel directly to confirm that my reservation was designated as Ambassador Club. When I arrived at the hotel, there was no separate check-in line (as advertised) and the manager on duty basically ignored me when I told him I was an ambassador club member and stuck me with a regular tiny room. I was nearly half an hour checking in the room and had to deal with the arrogant attitude of the manager on duty. They gave me a room in the ""modern"" tower, (built in the 60's) which was about 2/3 the size of a regular room at the Mark Hopkins (built in '29). I had to deal with torn sheets, cracked marble sinks, and the spare roll of toilet paper being located OUTSIDE the bathroom inside the closet - how convenient is that? The closet door, if you are not careful, may break the full length mirror attached to the bathroom door. I was not provided with a key to the minibar and I called for turndown service, which never happened. The next day, they finally got around to the fact that I was an Ambassador Club member and entitled to an upgraded room, but since I travel with a medical device which I already set up in the tiny room, I declined. To their credit, they did send some of the amenities I would otherwise be entitled to as an Ambassador Club member. I would not stay at this hotel next time I go to Chicago.

After sitting at the gas station on the phone for 1.5hrs, the money was finally put back in our account so we could continue our trip home. I would recommend a Holiday Inn over the Intercontinental any day.",0,nan,ta_n212
trip_advisor,"Overall the hotel is very nice. The rooms are spacious and well-appointed, but they tend to be aging or dated. My bathroom was particularly below average, with old wallpaper and a dingy tub with a crummy showerhead. The toilet paper roll holder was pulling out of the wall and its screws were exposed. The conceirge recommended an expensive and mediocre restaurant. I hate it when they do that- it makes me suspect they're getting kickbacks from places that otherwise don't get enough business on their own. Breakfast was very good. It's a relatively large european-style spread.",0,nan,ta_n213
trip_advisor,"Spent three nights in Chicago at this property. First of all, I have to say that it would be hard to imagine a better location as it is perfectly situated on the Magnificent Mile close to terrific restaurants, the Art Institute and Orchestra Hall. The hotel has two sides - the historic tower and a new wing. The rooms are larger on the historic side but generally are looking a little tired. This property needs to be renovated. Some observations: The junior suite I had was laid out strangely. A small bedroom and smaller sitting room separated by a corridor off of which was the very large bathroom. The mirror over the sink was not over the sink but skewed to the right - made shaving a challenge and messy. While descending in the elevator one morning, it started shaking so violently that I could barely stand up. It stopped on the 11th floor and I was greeted by an extremely worried looking hotel employee who had a technician shut it down. (This experience was far more powerful than coffee in helping me wake up - an adrenaline rush certainly cures sleepiness!) Reports from my group were of sinks stopped up, exposed bolts in rooms, and generally things not working. Now the good news - the staff is terrific. They make you feel welcome, are personable, have their own personalities, great service in the bar and really went the extra distance to help. I wish they had a better property to work in.",0,nan,ta_n214
trip_advisor,"It is always interesting going to a high quality Hotel. I cannot help but think about the service and the value. Maybe I have too high expectations. Certaintly the location is great and the swimming pool is really nice and the room was generally well appointed oh and the bed was great. But, the room was not well cleaned, a little smelly truthfully and they stole a watch that I left in the room. The hotel where immediately worried about there financial situation and not the service. I noticed here others on this site have lost stuff from this hotel. I know that this is always a possibility but really did not expect it at a hotel like this. Overall, Chicago exceeded my expectations but the intercontinental did not. Stay else where.",0,nan,ta_n215
trip_advisor,Used this hotel the first time I was in Chicago. For the prices and for being classified an intercontinental...I wouldn't consider it that good. The rooms were solid. The view was ok (but so is it virtually everywhere else on Michigan Ave.) The service was ok. The prices were ridiculous for everything from wifi to well everything else. We came here for a Jewish/Hindi wedding. Appetizer was fine. Main entree was a small portion of meat with forgettable everything else. Dessert was inedible. I have been to some other expensive hotels with similar ratings but they had more or just better rooms to an extent that it would be worth it. I personally preferred the Conrad. Better prices and better service.,0,nan,ta_n216
trip_advisor,"I am writing in regards to our stay April 22-24. We were celebrating our honeymoon and were disappointed with our stay. There was construction going on in the hotel and we were not notified of it prior to our stay. My husband had ordered champagne and strawberries for the room to be in there prior to our arrival...it wasn't. When he called to place the order again, it never showed up. We were so disappointed and surprised by the lack of service that we decided to forgo ordering them for a 3rd time. Our room was very small, drab and lacked the romantic setting we were looking for. We had called to request a room with a large tub, similar to the ones in the photos, prior to our arrival, noting that we didn't mind an upgrade cost. Instead, the tub was incredibly small. We have stayed at the Intercontinental in other cities before and had such high expectations for the Chicago location, especially considering we were celebrating such a happy, once-in-a-lifetime occasion. The service and amenities just didn't match up.",0,nan,ta_n217
trip_advisor,"Stayed here in November 2011 on a leisure trip to Chicago. Hotel is very dated, with some rooms that just aren't good enough. Front desk staff was rude. Will not be staying here again - prefer the Swissotel and the Hyatt properties (Regency is similarly priced, and Park Hyatt is 3x more) and a list of boutique hotels in the area as well (Kimpton, etc). Pros: -The only hotel that opens onto Michigan Avenue, very close to all of the excitement -Eno Wine Bar has a great selection of cheeses -Rooms are clean Cons: -Some hotel rooms just make no sense - our first room was tiny and had a window overlooking a ledge (effectively no view), and our second room had two windows that looked out onto a brick wall (actually no view) -You have to pay for everything - internet, gym, and the pool (which was not available due to renovation...) -Entire hotel was very old, not in a classical sense but in a ghost story one -Front desk staff was rude",0,nan,ta_n218

I, working in a upscale hotel, do encounter many guests checking in who this has happened to. All they want is a friendly face and a smooth check in.

trip_advisor,"My parents booked five nights at The James for its location and good reviews. They had a terrible first night with defective air conditioning and not much sympathy from the management staff. They sent engineers three times to repair the unit, and they insisted that it was getting cooler when it wasn't, under the rationale that the summer temperature is high and the filter was dirty. At my parents' request, the hotel staff moved them to a lower floor with a queen instead of a king and with neither a rate discount nor an effort to compensate them for the inconvenience and discomfort. The hotel insisted they were fully booked and reluctantly gave them that room. Don't book this hotel in the summer.

The waitress even asked why we were eating so early. It was 6:30pm. Our room in the hotel felt cramped. The beds were comfortable. The bathroom had maintenance problems. The maid service and turndown out night was good. All of the staff at the hotel were friendly and helpful. I just was not impressed by the quality of the hotel itself for what we were paying.",0,nan,ta_n221
trip_advisor,"Just returned from the James Hotel after staying at the Park Hyatt. I have stayed at most Chicago Hotels: Pennisula, Four Seasons, The Ritz, Fairmont etc. Had heard a little about the James and the Primehouse at the James. We paid MORE for the room at the James then at any of the above mentioned hotels. What a disappoitment! The room we stayed in had 2 double beds. The toilet broke and overflowed, the tub didnt drain while showering and the HUGE bathroom door that was almost too heavy to close broke several times. The closet had no door but a curtain to close and no drawer space for clothes at all. The room was very small and non descript. Much like staying at an IKEA but without the color. Windows to outside terribly dirty and the elevators dirty and small. The staff however was top notch and exceptionally helpful and friendly. The room had a huge 52"" plasma TV that was nice. There is NO way this hotel is 4 star yet. The room rate close to $500.00 a night was WAY of of line. We paid more here than any of the above mentioned hotels. The rate should have been about half of that.",0,nan,ta_n222
trip_advisor,"I recently returned from a trip to Chicago with my husband and baby and another couple and their baby. While the room at the hotel was quite nice we had a very negative experience with the front desk staff including managers. When we arrived it took over an hour to check in. We had requested two rooms on the same floor, which the hotel staff had confirmed a number of times prior to our arrival. When we arrived they could not accommodate us and offered nothing to us to make up for it. Eventually after we persisted they gave us half off for our room for one of the three nights we were there. We also asked the concierge to make us a reservation for brunch at a restaurant that would accommodate 4 adults and two babies in strollers. When we got to the restaurant they had only a reservation for 4 adults and had to make special arrangements to fit the babies in. We also had asked the hotel to make us an appointment for a personal shopper at Bloomingdales in order for us to save time shopping. We filled out forms in advance to direct the shopper and when we arrived for our appointment Bloomingdales advised us that they had only received the applications moments before and had not pulled together our requests. After complaining again to the manager at the hotel of these disappointments she advised that she would send something up to our room to compensate. This ""something"" never arrived. We will not be making a return visit to this hotel. While the housekeeping staff, location and room were quite nice the over all experience was very negative.",0,nan,ta_n223
trip_advisor,Very disapointed in the service and quality of this hotel. I travel quite frequently to chicago and have never had this happen at any other 4 star hotel. I reserved a king bed. At checkin I was informed they were out of kings and basically offered no type of compensation or upgrade. When i arrived at the room the air conditioner door was open and rattled all night. The TV did not work. Had to call for service. The following day returned from work at 6pm and found the room had not even been serviced. Stay somewhere else.,0,nan,ta_n224

The only table was coffee table height and the couch was some strange futon that was lower than the coffee table (!) and canted forward. Incredibly uncomfortable to sit at and ridiculous for room service meals or to work at computer. Since my room was configured like all the other Deluxe King Suites depicted in on line photos, I have to assume this design flaw with the couch/futon runs throughout the property. Bed was fine and bath was fine but I can't imagine why business travelers would rate this property well. The couch/futon seating is the worst I've encountered in a modern hotel.",0,nan,ta_n226
trip_advisor,"This hotel does not belong in the same league as The Peninsula, Four Seasons, or Ritz Carlton. It was more like staying at an overpriced W Hotel. Staff was very nice and attentive, but the lobby is cramped, and only two small elevators for 17 floors!! Several times the elevator was full by the time it reached our floor, and we were forced to take the stairs. The hotel must be flooding the travel websites itself with high reviews.",0,nan,ta_n227
trip_advisor,"I haven't actually stayed at this hotel- yet- but am already disappointed in their customer service. I visit Chicago quite often and usually stay at the InterContinental, but yesterday I read some online articles advertising The James Hotel's ""Cyber Monday Special"". The promo states that if you buy a gift certificate from their website, the hotel will match that amount in ""James Credits"" that can be used toward your stay. None of the articles gave an expiration date for these credits. My next trip to Chicago is in April, so I thought I'd give The James a try. I travel frequently with my pet and I've heard they have a very liberal pet-policy. So today I went online and bought a $500 certificate. Me, having the one track mind that I do, somehow missed the part about the credits expiring March 31, 2010. I realized my mistake immediately and called the hotel front desk to explain my predicament. I said I couldn't be in Chicago until April (I'm overseas on business until then), and asked if they could extend my credits an extra month, or it not, refund my gift certificate purchase. I had only just made the purchase minutes before and hadn't even recieved my email confirmation yet. Most businesses offer a 24 hr grace period. The girl at the front dest was extremely rude to me- basically saying ""too bad, it's your problem now"". She didn't even bother to act polite or pretend to be sympathetic about my situation at all. So now that I know this is the kind of service I can expect from The James, I might just call it a wash and stay at my usual hotel, or try Hotel Monaco. I hear they have great service and are good with pets too.",0,nan,ta_n228
trip_advisor,"This hotel was not worth it. From the moment we walked into the hotel lobby through check out, the staff were rude and contemptuous. Rooms were only serviceable, and certainly did not live up to the pompous self-descriptions on the website. The bathroom porthole and sliding door were odd and inconvenient. The 'fitness centre' was tiny and poor. We would not come here again.",0,nan,ta_n229

During the night it was very cold and we were not able to change the a.c., even though we switched it off, it went on cooling, strange! At night it was very loud from the street. In the morning they uploaded something infront of our window and I stood vertically in the bed, not what you need, if you only spend 1 night in a hotel. We came here a few years ago and had it better in mind. The area is in good walking distance to all famous shopping places, very good. Clean and fancy. Sorry, but next time we`ll be looking for a more quiet hotel in Chicago.",0,nan,ta_n230
trip_advisor,"In the 100 degree heat of a Chicago summer, it sucks if your air conditioner does not work. After 2 maintenance men attempted to rectify the issue I was offered a portable fan which on low speed sound as if a helicopter was hoovering over my room. I requested a room change and a not so polite, unsympathetic night front desk attendant stated that was not possible because the hotel was at capacity. Maybe a manager could help me in the morning. The next day went by and no call was received. At 7pm, I called the front desk. No one was aware of my problem. Approximately 45 minutes later, a manager returned my call and stated a double room was available. I accepted it was glee. Anything was better than a room that does not cool below 78 degrees in the middle of summer. I was paritally correct. The bathroom door of the new room did not close. Thank god my boyfriend and I are past the shy part of the relationship. As for room 1618, I believe I was not the first guest to complain about the air conditioner. What's unfortunate is they continued to place guests into this room. And did not offer any reufunds or perks for my sleepless night in the sauna! This hotel need a major overhaul!!",0,nan,ta_n231

We had a double/double and it was the size of a college dorm room, plus completely white walls and linens. Absolutely no color except for one accent pillow. It was very sterile and uninviting. We were on the 11th floor and the lobby for the elevator was dark and done in red and balck with minimal lighting. It looked like the entrance to hell, if not a haunted house. Staff was very nice and accomodating. I would not return to this hotel.",0,nan,ta_n232
trip_advisor,"While the James was once considered an elegant, chic establishment, it has lost its luster. The small rooms are filled with cheap Ikea type furnishings, Our tiny bathroom flooded with water that escaped the shower curtain. Showers and flushings from neighboring rooms sounded more like protective levies collapsing. The 2 small elevators could not handle the guests, and many of us were forced to walk down several flights of stairs rather then wait for extended periods of time. The thin windows could not contain street noise and sidewalk conversations were heard throughout the night. It was rather provocative to listen to the couple next door carousing, but also rather tacky & unsettling. It took more then 30 minutes for the valet to bring our car after we checked out. This hotel has lost it and the James sysndicate will have a difficult time competing in New York's Soho when they try to open in September. New Yorkers will not tolerate shabby incompetence.",0,nan,ta_n233
trip_advisor,"I just returned from a 2 night stay at the hotel. I had requested a high floor, quiet room. Neither request was honored. The windows are not well insulated, because the traffic, car horns and sirens continued all night long. On the first night two drunk parties woke us up in the hallway. The safe in our room did not work. Someone had locked it before our arrival. One of the pictures under the tv had been removed, leaving a screw sticking out of the wall. The lights are so dim, that is next to impossible to read. A small alcove with a stained bench had a ""reading light"" that was about 50 watts. Our room key cards didn't work, so we returned to the lobby where they recoded them. Upon returning to our room, they didn't work again and we stood there trying over and over again until finally we succeeded with no help from the staff. The bathroom is small and has no fan, so the steam covers the mirrors, and unless you leave the bathroom door open, it does not clear. On Friday night one small cookie was left in our room. What about a second guest. Are we supposed to split a 2 inch diameter cookie???!!!! On Sunday the phone rang with a 7 am wakeup call. We had not requested to be woken up!!!! The concierge did not know the way to get to O'Hare by train, and gave us a longer route than was necessary. I have stayed in much better hotels in Chicago...quieter and more spacious, more elegant and worth the money. This is definitely not worth $400 a month. (By the way, I live in Washington, DC and am used to city noise. This was unacceptable!)",0,nan,ta_n234
trip_advisor,"First, several day s prior to my stay, I called and spoke at length with the concierge and made a breakfast order for room-service Saturday and Sunday. Saturday they didn't bring breakfast - and when I called room-service they stated they never got the advance order from the concierge. When they finally did bring it - they brought the wrong thing.. and then brought the wrong order again on Sunday. I was further inconvenienced by in-room dining staff when we ordered room service Saturday night. The food was limp and uninspired. Further, I ordered soup - which arrived without a spoon. When I called in-room dining to request a spoon, I was told one would be forthcoming. 15 minutes later, a waiter arrived with a menu. When I explained I already had food and I didn't need a menu - I needed a spoon, he had the audacity to argue with me. I respectfully requested he return with a spoon and he agreed to do so. Another 15 minutes (and one bowl of cold soup) later I decided to call in-room dining back to request (again) they send someone with a spoon. They too argued with me and expressed that they'd already sent someone with a spoon. I explained that they had not - that I had received a menu I didn't request, but that no spoon was forthcoming. Another 15 minutes later, a spoon finally arrived. Thanks - for charging me $100+ so that I could argue over cold, flavorless food. In addition to the gross customer service, surly attitude, and sorry food, I found the room woefully lacking. It reeked exhaust fumes so much so that on Saturday night I woke up from the smell. Further, I had specifically requested when I booked the reservation that you keep me away from the elevators... I was right next to the elevators and had the displeasure of listening to them ding all night long as other guests came and went.",0,nan,ta_n235
trip_advisor,"I have stayed at the James a few times, it is my go to hotel in Chicago. This last trip makes me think it is time to start looking for other options. The Good: Location is awesome, just off Michigan Ave, Trader Joe's across street for some healthier snacking. It is a great location, easy to walk most anywhere. The door staff are very friendly and helpful. The overall feeling is modern, upbeat. Turn down service with cookie is nice. Free Wifi (which worked to varying degrees throughout stay) The Bad: They claim to be a 4.5 star hotel, which to me, means better then a 4 star and online with a 5 star (without a pool). They used to have Kiehls toiletries and now have ""Harmony"" brand. Additionally, they now have the large bottles attached to the wall which you get to share with the other guests that stayed in the room before you. It is what I would expect from Holiday Inn or my gym, but not a 4.5 star hotel. I asked about the switch (mainly because when I booked they still had Kiehls in website description) and they claimed that the reason they went the communal bottle route was to be ""green"". That is hard to believe, as it's not like the hotel is making other efforts to be green (they still have incandescent light bulbs, housekeeping leaves the lights and radio on when they do turn down, they don't recycle in room, etc). They are obviously trying to cut costs, and it shows. More: the rooms are in need of some updating, they are looking somewhat tired. My third floor room was quite loud with the motorcyclers trying to prove their manhood out front (not their fault). Don't take the stairs (as the stairwell is straight out of horror movie), even though the wait for one of the two elevators might be awhile. The phone staff was fairly rude (granted, they didn't like me questioning their toiletry change). I feel bad giving such a low rating, but it really did not come close to my expectations (from previous stays there). I will start trying out new hotels in the area.",0,nan,ta_n236
trip_advisor,"My in-laws booked a one night stay for New Years Eve for the two of us to stay at the James. To be brief there were a few things wrong with our stay which will prevent us from returning and advising our friends not to stay there. 1) Shoddy construction of room fixtures: ceiling light was missing leaving a fist-sized hole with wires exposed, BOTH towel racks fell off the wall without being touched, and bathroom door often came off it's sliding mechanism with gentle use. 2) When we reported these problems, employees simply put the towel racks back on the wall without properly adhering them to the wall. 3) Upon check-out, they did not have record of my in-laws paying for our stay, though it was noted on our reservation that they had made it for us. We had to pay for our ($300) gift and the in-laws were extremely upset.

I booked a non-smoking room, but upon arrival, the receptionist told me that there was no non-smoking room left. Of course he was lying. I argued with him for 5 minutes, before he reluctantly gave me a non-smoking room. At checkout, they tried to charge me $40 upgrade fee each day, because I requested a non-smoking room. This was completely ridiculous. I had to go argue with the receptionist again before they agreed to take away the charges. The room was quite small, the TV was broken, so I had to call someone to fix the TV.

Upon arriving we were told that they did not have that and we only had the choice of a Smoking room. When argued they stated ""well you booked thru hotwire so you do not have priority"". As we entered the room I noticed the bathroom door was off track and the bathroom light did not turn on. We called the front desk and they fixed the door but not the light. Later that eveing as I took a shower the seal around the shower was so poor water got all over the floor and towels. Also, I must add the room reaked of smoke. The next day when we checked the front desk clerk asked how our stay was and when we told him the problems, he told us the total and had not concern of our issues. We also checked in our bags for the day, and the bellmen came quickly and made very rude comments about us hurrying up so he could get on with his day.

trip_advisor,"Our suite at the Knickerbocker are quite nice, but the behavior and attitude of the staff is beyond abysmal. First, a member of the staff entered our room mid-day unannounced only to apologize after realizing that he failed to verify that we were present. Not a tremendous problem, but when the young woman at the front desk replied ""What do you want me to do about it"" with the tone of a flippant teenager, I began to suspect that a severe deficiency in manners may have been evident in the staff. Fast forward to this evening. Following a lovely meal off the premises, we chose to turn in a bit early at 11:30 pm only to discover that despite our best intentions, the bass from a party downstairs was more than audible in our room. Acting prudently and with restraint, we decided to phone the front desk to inquire as to why our room had been inadvertently annexed into the party downstairs, but yet again we were met with a curt and quite rude response. Sean at the front desk informed us that the party was a greater priority for the hotel, and that the family dictated that the music was to be set at a certain volume. On one hand I appreciated his honesty, but on the other, I truly would have preferred that he at least pretended to care about the guests who chose to stay at his property. Since we're out of options for the evening, we've decided to stay up and try to watch TV for the time being, but given the circumstances, the staff could have easily made up for the negative situations that arose in quick succession. Also, I was alarmed to learn that while I slept the prior night, a possible gang-related shooting took place mere blocks from the property. This wouldn't have been a concern if like nearby hotels, the Knickerbocker chose to enlist any type of security measures within their lobby. Would I stay here again? Maybe on a dare, or if someone else was footing the bill. Yet I've had better experiences in road side motels, and the employee training regimen could use a serious revamping to better serve the interests of the guests, and more importantly simple common sense.",0,nan,ta_n241

However I would NOT recommend this hotel. I would rather have paid $100 and got something more updated - trouble with old it tends to look somewhat seedy and this was true in this case.

The bathroom was unbelieveably small and smelled terribly. We had to call the front desk twice before towels that we requested were delivered (which frankly may as well have been paper towels, nothing plush about them at all). We didn't have enough pillows and when we requested an extra it was never delivered. Room service cart was left outside our door all night. All in all, it was a very disappointing stay.

Giving up we decided to just exit the highway and try our luck at a 7-11 store.

Checking in we were not greeted by anyone, even the receptionist did not greet us!! no welcome to the knickerbocker, nothing!

The guy could not find our reservation and he seemed frustrated that we are checking-in at 2 am!! Well if they were able to give us directions maybe we would have been there 2 hours earlier.

It costs $10/day to connect to internet. If you want to use internet in the lobby, minimum charge is $5 per use. To use the phone in the rooms for local calls, it is $1.25/15mins and then 10 cents every min. Even the local calls are charged, what a rip off!!!

The rooms are small and bathrooms are tiny, all of which is to be expected in an old urban hotel, but apparently care has not been given to updating the hotel (ever!). The crown molding and base boards are cracked and it appears to only have been painted over and over again. The newer tub liner in the bathroom is merely floating above the old tub and when you stand in the shower it bubbles under your feet. The shower tiles are old and the grout is not clean. This hotel has not been restored the updating that has been done are merely band-aides. There is no fan exhaust in the bathroom and the carpet is ontop of a very hard surface, probaly concrete with no pad in between. The lobby is smokey because of the large open bar in the small space.

trip_advisor,I booked a hotel room for 4 nights at this hotel through an online vendor. After booking the hotel room I contacted the hotel to request a room with 2 beds. I was told in 3 different conversations with hotel personnel that I would have a room with 2 double beds. When I arrived I was given a King sized bed and was told that there was nothing the hotel could do for myself and my 3 guests. Apparently the hotel management saw no problem with 4 people sleeping in 1 bed. The staff was completely unaccomodating. To add insult to injury we met other guests that had obtained a room with 2 beds by just walking in off the street the day after we checked in. I would not recommend this hotel to anyone. The customer service is well below what is acceptable. The location of the hotel is great but there are many other hotels that offer excellent service and high quality rooms to stay in while visiting Chicago. Bottom line is do NOT stay at the Millenium Knickerbocker!!!,0,nan,ta_n248

Anyway, when I arrived at 11 pm from the airport, I was told that they had overbooked the hotel and had no room for me. They booked me at a dumpy 2 star motel by the airport. They gave me $20 for a taxi to get there, and it cost me $35. I was late for a meeting the next morning because of the extra travel and packing/unpacking. The Millennium offered no compensation whatsoever for their foul-up. No free drink, no room upgrade, nothing. Since I booked on the internet, I was chopped liver. Beware.",0,nan,ta_n249
trip_advisor,"We stayed at this hotel with our two teenage daughters duing a part business, part family fun trip in July. We were very impressed with the location, within walking distance to great restraunts and shopping, inlcuding Water Tower Place (a great mall!). We were quite disappointed with the room cleanlinees and size. The bedspreads were filthy and so thin. The room decor is in dire need of an upgreade. The bathroom had no fan and it really smelled badly of mold and mildew. The shower actually had mold in the corners! This was a very tight squeese for 4 people. Especially the bathroom. The beds and pillows were quite uncomfortable. Even the elevators were tiny and could barely fit 6 people! Thank goodness there were a few elevators. Luckily we booked this room on priceline and would have never paid full price. The only upside was the great location. Also beware- its cheaper to take a taxi to the airport than the airport shuttle! Millenium promotes the airport shuttle but take a cab!",0,nan,ta_n250
trip_advisor,"The location of this hotel is excellent. The hotel itself is not a 4 star like they say - in my opinion. The room decor is horrible (probably more European than I am used to) and the room is small and furnished like an old apartment. On the upside, if you want to stay in a great location, feel safe, and can put up with some aesthetic issues and can get a great deal then this will work. I prefer Westin or Marriott...something that you can count on.",0,nan,ta_n251

If it wasn't for the great location of the hotel, there would be nothing positive to say/",0,nan,ta_n252
trip_advisor,"This hotel has the worst rooms we have stayed in during the last 10 years. The first room they gave us was a shock. TINY and the bathroom was a joke,, you had to step inside, move out of the way just to shut the door. The furniture is disgusting and all the wood trim was VERY beat up and painted over about 100 times. so they transfered us to the 'executive suite' That room had a tiny bathroom.. I mean TINY! The furniture was hideous and dirty. It was on the 3rd level so you heard every conversation on the street below and traffic was loud. The only impressive part is the lobby.. but don't be fooled. because after that .. the floors above look like they need a major overhaul.. and the rooms were not worth even $100 per night. we stayed there a year ago because we got stuck through Priceline deal. I don't think we want to do Priceline again only because they have the Knickerbocker as a 4 star Hotel and we don't ever want to go back there again. 2 Stars at best for the dumpy Knickerbocker. They should be ashamed of themselves for even allowing guests to stay in those rooms. Boomer. Naperville, IL",0,nan,ta_n253
trip_advisor,"From checkin to departure a poorly run hotel. It took 30 minutes in line to check in because only one clerk was on duty. Another person, perhaps the manager, was in the back room but never came out to help the check in clerk even as the line grew. The hotels elevators are small resulting in 10 minute waits to get up and down floors,especially when 1 of the 3 breaks, as seems to be frequent occurence. After specifically asking for a room away from the elevators, I was assigned to a room directly across from them, necessitating another 20 minute wait in line. The room smelled of mildew and water dripped from the ceiling the first night. I requested a news paper be delivered to my room - it appeared on the morning and never again. Basically, the hotel is understaffed and poorly trained. Never again !",0,nan,ta_n254

Despite having paid for Priceline, I ate the money I had already spent and called for a reservation at the Westin and went there for the weekend, instead. I didn't regret it for a second. You will be disappointed if you stay at the Millenium Knickerbocker because you are paying for a Holiday Inn at the price of a Westin when you could have the real deal for just a little more. The location is not worth the place being old and so unimpressive. There are enough hotels near the loop (and near a train/bus stop if you need to move around the city inexpensively) that you should not spend the money on the Millenium. Do not waste your time and stay here--this is a trap because of its location, but it's not worth it. Really.",0,nan,ta_n255

The temperature in Chicago was a balmy 99 degrees, and the temp in the room that they gave us was about 85 degrees. When we called to complain at 11:00 am, they told us to turn the temp down to 40degrees. We went back at 7:30pm. it was still humid, the beds were moist & the room very stuffy. Called again, they sent somone to fix it, & he recommended getting a new room, because the room will not cool down. They told us they were booked, yet, after the maintenance man called, they suddenly had a room available, go figure? So they move us to another room, guess what, it is 85 degrees. Again, they told us to turn it down to 40, needless to say, it never cooled down & we should have just slept on the street. We travel a lot, and we stayed here one night, and it was awful!!. At check out, I had to re-tell our entire room issue, they actually ended up not charging us for the night, thank god they did not offer us anothers nights stay, because we would never go back. Also, the room decor is very old and stuffy. If your going to Chicago, don't stay at the Millenium Knickerbocker!!",0,nan,ta_n256
trip_advisor,"The historic feel of the hotel really had a strong influence on my choice to book this hotel. Unfortunately, the ambiance of the hotel could not make up for the rest of its shortcomings. The front desk staff was rude, the doormen were usually busy chatting or playing on their cell phones instead of greeting us or opening the door. There are three elevators but good luck with them all working. They are very very small and when only one is up and running...you end up waiting a long time for one. Not fun when you are on the 12th floor. The room was TINY and the air conditioning did not work at all...the room felt damp and miserable. We put the thermostat as low as it would let us (65) and the room never went below 78. (and it was 107 outside the whole trip!!!). There really are no amenities inside the hotel other than an ice machine and a slightly overpriced restaurant. Internet is not free either... Overall, I would never stay here again.",0,nan,ta_n257

The tickets were at the Hotel General Managers office. The reception denied that they had arrived. We had to spend most of a day travelling to the ticket agent to resolve it. The Hotel did not find any reason to apologize for the inconvenience. The concert was the reason for our travel to Chicago. Else, the Hotel had good standard, free internet in the lobby, not to good view from the rooms, and friendly staff at the restaurants and the bars.

I informed the front desk who made apologies and said they would take care of it immediately. I got home that night with a tiny tiny bar of soap (hand soap) for the bath/shower and they had replaced the shampoo in its original place, nicely displayed, but with the EXACT SAME bottle of shampoo that was now 1/8 full.

trip_advisor,"While overall a decent property, the incident I had with this hotel has been like none other in my history of travel. I recently stayed at the Hotel Monaco for five nights, checking out on Monday, March 19th. Shortly after leaving the hotel and retrieving my car from the valet, my partner and I noticed a large scrape on the bumper of the car that wasn't present upon checking in. We had not requested use of the car for the duration of our stay. I called the hotel approximately two hours after checking out and was directed to speak with the garage manager at Park One (their valet company) who stated that he would review video of the car and call me back within 48 hours to verify that the car was unblemished upon arrival, and was scraped upon departure from the garage. The garage manager, Mike Yunan, didn't call back until I had an email exchange with the general manager of the hotel, Marco Scherer. When he finally got back to me, the garage manager stated that he would file an ""incident report"" and claim with his insurance company, Travelers, which would eventually deny the claim because garage staff wouldn't admit fault or liability, nor did they supply the video they stated they had of the car entering or exiting the garage, which could have verified that the damage wasn't present upon check-in, but was at check-out. Their insurance representative even told me that the garage does not have surveillance at that location, contradicting the garage manager. In the end, this Kimpton InTouch guest got stuck with a $1,000 bill for parking at this Kimpton property: an almost $500 paint scrape on top of a $48/per day parking fee, rental car expenses, several hours of lost time in dealing with the issue, and one gigantic headache. In the end, do NOT trust the valets or staff at this hotel, and take your business elsewhere if at all possible.",0,nan,ta_n261
trip_advisor,"My first stay at this hotel and was expecting good things based on reviews. For some reason, I kept being disappointed at every turn. Noisy room on the 4th floor. Could not get the room to cool down - it was stifling. BE WARNED - No water, no mini-bar no vending machine, no nothing once you get in your room. You might as well be in prison. They have coffee in the morning, but it starts at 6 so I had to wait both days. I guess that is convenient for them, but what about me? Workout facility - pretty small but not the smallest. The only treadmill I could get on was broken. Guess what a cooler with water in it! Oh no - it was only stocked for one day. After that nothing. Way to set expectations and then fail to deliver. Same with towels - one day they have them - next day they don't. They essentially forced me to sign up for their loyalty program to avoid a riduculous $10 charge for wireless (go a few doors down to Starbucks where it is free). They should fire the marketing moron who came up with that approach. I have stayed at much better for less. Won't be coming back.",0,nan,ta_n262

The front desk staff was condescending and not even remotely helpful. The room was not clean, the gold fish we had requested came many hours after we told them we would be arriving, they never bothered to come turn down the beds, and the late check-out ""priviledges"" which were guarenteed when I booked the room suddenly became ""upon request"" - boy the extra 30 minutes they gave me sure were helpful.

My gripe comes from the fact that we were obviously put in a ""crappy"" room. It overlooked the back of the building and the roof of a building next to us. The toilet in the room was not bolted to the floor.

There are some other problems; the furnishings are quite rundown, and housekeeping wasn't very helpful. We booked a suite and the sofa bed, chair and coffee table in the living room area had all had some very hard use. I've attached pictures, so you can see the considerable gap in the sofa and the lack of pillows. Comfortable it was not! The chair bottom is all broken down too. I invited one of the Assistant Managers to view our furniture, and a slight adjustment was made in our rate. As to housekeeping, we had ordered an in-room coffee service (which Kimpton's web site says is there, but you have to specifically request) and at no time did housekeeping leave us coffee. We had to call the front desk every day. And, housekeeping neglected our fish and on our next to last day we found it floating dead at the top of the fish bowl. I had requested water be added to the bowl when I noticed it going down and my note was disregarded. These things may not matter to you, but if you plan to spend a week, like we did, you might want to be comfortable.

The fact that they have a complimentary wine reception every night at 5 doesnt take away from the fact that they have terrible beds and the place isnt as clean as it should be for a 4 star hotel. The hallways smelled like a dog parlor and the carpets in my room look like they hadn't been cleaned...well, ever. The decorative pillows on my bed were so filthy they were actually stained brown and looked like they had been sitting outside for everyone to use and then put back on my bed. The decor of the hotel was nice and eclectic but it wasnt enough to convince me to ever stay here again. The bed was the most uncomfortable thing I have every tried to sleep on. I couldnt sleep the whole week that I stayed there. It was hard and lumpy and the pillows were tiny. my final say is that it is an over priced Holiday Inn.....",0,nan,ta_n267

My visit was anything but, mainly attributed to the fact that they put me on the second floor, facing the street. I awoke at 4 a.m. and never did return to sleep because of the constant street noise and screeching of the L train that sounded as though it was just outside my window.

trip_advisor,"My wife and I brought our daughter downtown for a blowout ""American Girl"" Weekend and chose the Monaco because of it's glowing reviews. We arrived late and maybe that's when they put out their second-stringers, but we felt unwelcome by the desk staff--like we were an intrusion. I'll never understand this--they're in the hospitality business and they're inhospitable! (This is getting picky, but the reception desk which is cleverly designed to look like a vintage Louis Vuitton trunk needs some maintenance. The repeated ""HM"" initials are peeling off--looks like they used rub-downs where they should have silk screened for durability). When we got to our room we found the maid's ratty work shoes at the foot of the bed (yuck!). I'm still trying to figure out that scenario. There were no ashes--so I've ruled out spontaneous combustion. Also, to the disappointment of my daughter, the much-advertised goldfish was MIA. The bellhop (who apologized for the shoes) explained that they take away the fish when they turn down the bed ""...is that OK?"" he said. I think the proper response at a hotel like this would have been to bring up a stinking 35C/ fish to make a tired 5-year-old happy. On the up side, the rooms are nice and have an over-the-top decoration that my daughter loved (""I'd like to live here!"" she said). The bed is VERY comfortable--my wife wants the same brand now. The bathroom is nicely appointed with quality materials and good strong shower--except for the cheap fall-apart-while-you're-using-it toilet paper. Come on Kimpton! How much can a decent roll cost? The view towards the river is great (try to get one) and my daughter loved the upholstered wide ledge by the window--she closed the curtains and was in her own ""club house"" watching the world go by from from high above the city.

trip_advisor,"I have stayed at the Omni off an on over the years. On business, for personal trips. This trip started off quite rocky, and left me very un-impressed. 1) Be aware, they have a new policy where they charge debit card $55 per day for ""incidentals"" which you *may* incur. They do this if you elect not to use a standard credit card. Even if you have booked and paid for your room in advance. The desk clerk claimed ""all the hotels do this now""...funny how when I put a remote employee at the O'Hare hilton on my business debit card, I was never asked for additional funds. Having a policy is one thing, spreading blame for it is another. While not a problem for me, someone who plans trips down to the dollar and dime might encounter a problem with this ""policy"" of theirs. To my knowledge, they never did this sort of thing before. (I don't use Credit Cards, its why I have money in a recession. =)) 2) Rooms were clean, but their in room accoutrements and mini bar items had no price list. The only thing labelled with a price was a bottle of water (about 600 ML) for $7.50. As such, be careful with the tray of goodies. If the water is $7.50, imagine what the snickers bar might cost. 3) Our suite had a bathroom sliding door between the bedroom and bathroom which appeared broken, and would not move. Calling the front desk resulted in ... nothing. Finally about 9:00 PM I elected to have another look at it, and it seemed to be off its track. I was able to successfully ""fix"" it, but the lack of response from maintenance, considering the rate for a suite, is sad. I remember this hotel being much more attentive and responsive. 4) The seem to cut a lot of corners on room stocking now.

Needless to say I drained the tub and took a shower...I really don't care for showers. Oh yes...the toilet leaked as well...The staff were very helpful but I was disappointed. I travel extensively and don't think I will return. we needed color copies for a business meeting and their printer was broken, so the man in the business center took the jump drive to another part of the hotel, printed the presentation and delivered it to our room. They try! We booked online for a weekend package and got a room on the 10th floor with a view of the windows of another building...but we weren't there too much.",0,nan,ta_n284
trip_advisor,We experienced bed bugs in our room while staying at the Omni Chicago Hotel on the Magnificent Mile. We never received a return call from General Manager Sanjay Mahajan after several voicemails. We will never return to the hotel and will work to spread the word. We also heard from several employees from the cleaning staff that this is common in the hotel.,0,nan,ta_n285
trip_advisor,Here are some pros and cons: Pros: -Good location -Nice staff -Clean room Cons: -Lack of bathroom amenities (I get better items at a Holiday Inn) -Housekeeping wasn't so great... 1. A bathroom rug was taken out of my room (no idea why) and never returned it. The marble floor in the bathroom was very dangerous when slippery...I had to throw towels on the ground to make sure I did not fall. 2. I was charged for items I did not take out of the minibar.,0,nan,ta_n286
trip_advisor,"My family booked five nitghts at the Omni Chicago for our upcoming spring break. We took advantage of a pre-paid, non-cancellable offer. We subsequently received a ""Bed & Breakfast"" offer via email and immediately called the hotel to inquire whether we could switch our reservation (same dates, different offer). We called the 800' number and the customer services representative was so obnoxiously condescending and ignorant, we simply hung up. We had been looking forward to our vacation, but now I am not sure I made the right choice with this hotel. I should have paid closer attention to the reviews - the Ritz, the Four Seasons, and the Peninsula would have never treated us this way. I will post again after our stay on April 17th.",0,nan,ta_n287
trip_advisor,"I have been meaning to write a review of the Omni but wasn't sure if people would believe it as most of the reviews are quite high. We stayed here for 5 nights. The room was fine when I walked in. But about five minutes or so I was all congested. Thought it might have been from the flight. I then noticed there was dust everywhere. The TV, the Minibar, and worst of all the air vent. It was literally hanging off the vent. I called down to front desk they said they would send housekeeping up. After 30 minutes of waiting and noticing other things. A bathroom door that wouldn't close, broken light fixtures, a toe or fingernail on the bed. broken bathroom fixtures. This place was a dump. Hopefully the pictures will show some of it. I could go on and on. Almost 90 minutes later the hotel manager came up to look at the room, Both he and head of housekeeping were ""shocked"" at the room. We were moved to another room, not as large as this one was because the hotel was completely booked, or so I was told. I stayed at the Omni once prior and have to say was very impressed. But this will be the last time. Sad to say. The hotel did cut the rate of our 5 day stay, but doesn't explain how a hotel of this caliber let a room like this pass any inspection.",0,nan,ta_n288
trip_advisor,"My family has dubbed the Omni in Chicago ""Fawlty Towers"" because there always seems to be something wrong. This time our room was right above the kitchen and the odor of cooking grease wafted through our bedroom all night long. It smelled like a greasy spoon restaurant and it permeated all of our clothing. The bedroom window was bolted shut, so we couldn't get any fresh air into the room. With the amount that the Omni is charging for a room, they should have a much better ventilation system.",0,nan,ta_n289

However, what they don't tell you, is that the breakfast consists of a cup of coffee and a bisquit (or two)! Moreover, you need to ask for these ""tickets"" at the lobby when you check in - they won't give them to you automatically!

trip_advisor,"Will start by saying the employees were wonderful, especially in the restaurant / bar employees, could not have been nicer.....what appeared to be the hotel manager went above and beyond....Unfortunately, that's where it ends! The rooms, in my opinion, appeared different then pictures and were worn and ratty...you know, uninviting sofa and crappy coffee table and desk area... the first room I was given had bright construction lights shining in my room and men working on the next building that were looking directly into my window!!I kid you not; they seemed as if they were about 15-20 ft from my window!! And this was after I specifically had asked for a room that might have a decent view..I was then switched to a room that had virtually no light and was truly, again... just worn out!!!NOT a 4 star hotel, this seemed to be closer to a 2, perhaps being extremely kind 3 star...I travel on business so I know the difference...I merely touched the cabinet door on the bar unit and it literally fell off in my hand! I complained to a very nice woman from housekeeping and to her credit, she made sure the door was fixed ASAP. They gave me a bottle of wine to compensate..which I utilized to dull my senses as to my surroundings for the next 2 days....I wanted to give Omni a shot...big mistake... Unfortunately, brought a friend with me to show her how great Chicago was and I was soooo embarrassed, as I had chosen the hotel...She was extremely disappointed as well...should have gone with my first instinct which was the Conrad!! Lesson learned!",0,nan,ta_n291
trip_advisor,"No excuse for a hotel like this to have cold showers on three consecutive days and then to tell customer that engineering will look at it and that we should have told them sooner.

trip_advisor,"Complete disappointment. Problems: 1. The alarm clock/stereo thing was broken in my room. It was constantly emitting low, changing hissing noises. Sooo annoying. And there was no off switch on the damn thing. I had to move the bed to unplug it (the outlet was wayyy back, buried behind the big bed). I kept hearing it, and didn't realize what it was, until it had kept me awake for a few hours. 2. The shower was ONLY incredibly hot. Turn it all the way cold...very hot. Turn it to hot, and you get boiling hot. Grrrrreat. So how do I get water that won't scald me? This is very inconvenient early in the morning when you need a shower and are in a hurry, and have to dance into and out of painfully hot water. Good job Omni! 3. Hallway carpets are disgusting and old. Walking around, you'd think you're in a motel 6. And my floor had been flooded or something, and they had box fans running in the hallway, 24/7, to try to dry it out. Talk about an overpriced dump.",0,nan,ta_n293

We reserved a King Suite, and the hotel put us in a Queen Suite without telling us up front. Only after we confronted the Manager did they come clean about the switch, he offered us a free breakfast, but would not up-grade our room.

Though my son was eager to swim as soon as we checked in the pool was still closed at 630 pm. We gave up & went out for the evening. We had a very noisy sleepless night. We weren't facing MI ave, but still heard sirens and I'm not sure what the other noise was, but it sounded like a malfunctioning hand dryer in our ceiling that would sound off about 20x an hour throughout the entire night. I called the front desk the next morning and was told the pool was open, so my (very excited) son got his bathing suit on and we got to the fitness center only to be told by housekeeping that the pool was closed for construction. Upon calling the front desk again the lady claimed she was unaware of the maintenance crew's actions & on my insistence she said she'd look into it. A gentleman called back an hour later & said the pool should open at 5pm...it was 9am. It is now 6pm & we still haven't even seen the pool. We check out tomorrow.

trip_advisor,"Ok, I just feel if you're paying well over $200 for a room you should get something to show for it. The location was on Michigan Ave but if I pay just a little more I could have had way better (Peninsula, Park Hyatt, shoot the Omni was 10x better). We ordered a deluxe executive suite, and it was so below sub par. The room was very small (so small the ice bucket was in the closet), the bathroom was just as small, just well lit (a plus). Wallpaper was peeling, outlets barely covered, no view. The only thing appealing was the bed, and that may have been because I was so tired. And we were really excited because this is the Palmer House. The Palmer House does have nice restaurants: the Lockwood (quiet, distinguished) and the Potter's Lounge (grown/sexy)",0,nan,ta_n300
trip_advisor,"First of all, Expedia.com charged me for an additional person per my instructions but when I arrived at the Hotel these monies were not included and the complimentary breakfast was not offered. The Hotel service person who checked us in forgot to give me back my parking ticket but left a generic message for me stating that there was an envelope at the front desk. I had to wait in line for another 20 minutes to discover this the whole time this person was looking at me and never said a word!! I was charged and paid for parking adjacent to the Hotel. When we went to leave the gate would not open. We had to find the parking garage office and the Manager had to call several times over to the Hotel until finally someone picked up. They confirmed my payment and then we were allowed to leave the structure. The Hotel itself is beautiful!!! The bell hops and doormen were just wonderful. They were more than helpful and gracious but the internal staff were rude and not helpful at all!!!!",0,nan,ta_n301
trip_advisor,"I have stayed at the Palmer a half dozen times in the past and it has been ok. The main drawbacks are the check in desk is always slow and they charge you to use the fitness center, which is truly annoying. In addition, there are so many rooms you often have to walk a hundred years to find your room once you get off the elevator. Other than that, it is a classic old hotel with some yesteryear charm. But, the room they gave me most recently was so small it was laughable. The door to the bathroom could not open as it hit the desk, and the chair to the desk could not be properly pulled out as it hit the bed. There was no room for them to put the TV in front of the bed, so they shoved it off to the side. Room 23242 makes prison cells seem roomy and I promise that no one who works there would ever put someone they know in this hovel. It should not be sold as a hotel room.",0,nan,ta_n302
trip_advisor,"The hotel is almost always very helpful. This stay caused me to re-think if I like the Palmer House. I had dirty covers for the bed. It was also the smallest room in the hotel I am sure. My husband and I usually come 8 times each year. He is there doing Business and CTA work. We are not pleased with the size of the room at all now. Rooms have always had two chairs, desk, and usually 22 by 25 feet. Not this room on the 11th floor. It was only 15 X 17 approx. The service men at the doors have always said a welcome but not this time. In the past we had a bell man steal a $300. pair of sun glasses and the hotel did nothing about our loss financially.",0,nan,ta_n303
trip_advisor,"We stay at the Palmer House when we attend conferences in Chicago. It is a stately building. But this year, there were ... problems we have not had before. First, they now have wi-fi available, but it is not free. The cost is $7.50 per hour. On-line it indicated that Hilton hotels charge about $4, but this was almost double. Many hotels have free wi-fi. Wi-fi is wi-fi, so the level of service is not a factor that could justify this exorbitant cost. They also charge for their fitness center, even when you are only going to use the machines. There is no business center in-house for copies, etc. Our bed was against a wall that separated us from the bathroom in the next room. It did not separate us from the bathroom noises. When someone took a shower (at 5:30 a.m.), the pipes ""sung"" like old pipes do,but very loudly. An empty wine glass sat outside someone's room door for days without being picked up by housekeeping. The concierge desk had only one person and there was always a line. If you called down, you were put on hold while they dealt with the people in the line. The staff were all very nice, and the location can't be beat, but the luxury prices for normal services felt like a ripoff this year. I doubt we'll return....",0,nan,ta_n304
trip_advisor,"I stayed at Palmer House for one night in early January this year. During the check in, the front desk lady asked me to show my confirmation letter of my reservation.

I did what she told me and went to the bell station. However, people at the bell station was totally confused and none of them have the key. A bellman was nice enough to help me go ask their staff at the front desk. I finally got checked in after waiting at the lobby for about 15 minutes. As other people pointed out before, the room I got was small and old with a twin bed, and I could hear people next door using the bathroom. This was not a pleasant experience, even though I paid over 100 dollars to the hotel.",0,nan,ta_n305
trip_advisor,"My husband and I and our 10 month old took a quick trip to Chicago. We stayed one night at The Palmer house after reading that they were a four star hotel. I guess I am just confused as to why they are a four star hotel. Yes the lounge area is nice but the rooms were so small I couldn't set up a pack and play for my son. I had to call and ""upgrade"" my room just so my son could have someplace to sleep. The lower levels have been updated which makes them slightly better than a Holiday Inn. The wall paper is peeling away from the walls and the shower was dirty. I will NEVER stay there again.",0,nan,ta_n306
trip_advisor,"Not impressed at ALL. The hotel itself looks really nice, especially in the big foyer area. Our room was small, and the bathroom needed some major upgrades. It had the green tile, like at your grandmother's house, all over the walls, and 2 people couldn't fit in it if you tried. We could hear the people beside us in the early morning every morning, so obvioulsy the walls aren't so thick. Our room looked directly on to a brick building outside, VERY close, we couldn't even tell if it was nice outside or not. We are assuming we were not in a renovated room from the looks of it, and I felt yucky the whole time in it. I just wouldn't pay lots of money to stay here, there is nothing exceptional about it at all.",0,nan,ta_n307
trip_advisor,"The hotel is excellently situated for visiting The Art Institute or Millennium Park. It is an ""old classic"" of a hotel, and the main lobby is a must see, but I would not stay there again. The problem with any hotel dating from long ago (the current one was built in 1923-25) is that, even with extensive remodeling (which was done in 2007-2009) it is hard to create spaces that are comparable to what is expected today (in many cases the walls are load bearing so cannot be changed too much). We had a reasonably sized room (king bed and space for a desk and lounge chair) but the bathroom was very small with little space to spread out toiletries. Also, there was no coffee machine in the room - something I have come to expect in virtually all hotels these days. My major complaint about this stay was the Executive Lounge. It is usually worth while to pay the extra for access - in most hotels it is not much more than the cost of two breakfasts and there are usually some hors d'oeuvres in the evening along with a modest wine at a modest price. (Since we are currently at the diamond level in the Hilton Honors program, we get access for free at the Hiltons but I usually upgrade at other chains such as the Hyatt.) At the Palmer Executive Lounge I ordered a couple of glasses of wine (there was a bartender on duty) and was slightly surprised by the cost - $9/glass which came to $21.44 for two with tax and tip - and was even more surprised by the wine. It was about the worst wine I had tasted in many years. I didn't think it was even as good as Trader Joe's cheapest $2.99 wine that I tried a couple of weeks ago. Unfortunately I didn't get a look at the bottle to see what it was (although I did notice that she had to fish it out of the back of a cupboard). I noticed that a couple of groups in the executive lounge had brought their own wine in - and I can understand iot at the prices they were charging. It then occurred to me that the wine had been sitting around open for some time. I checked the room service menu and saw that they offered three red wines by the glass - the same three varietals as at the bar. The cabernet was a William Hill at $10.50/glass from room service. I presume that what I had had at some time been a William Hill that had been left to turn to vinegar. It was slightly more expensive from room service, but I hope that it was in a lot better condition.",0,nan,ta_n308
trip_advisor,"I stayed in this hotel for 5 days in November together with my colleagues. Internet only wired available for 20 additional dollars a day. No fridge or microwave included in the price. Our room had two too soft full size beds. In the hall way the wallpaper had come off the wall. Who doesnt believe it, check out the 16th floor close to room 212. With discount we paid more than 300 dollars a night which is ridiculous. I stayed in the Hyatt Regency before for much cheaper and that was way better. The restaurant in the main hall is very nice and the food is tasty, but although being almost the only customer it took forever that the food got served. please stay away and take one of the plenty alternatives nearby.",0,nan,ta_n309
trip_advisor,"Will not stay here again. We were here pre-construction so didn't have the noise problems that others are now experiencing. But room and service quality were so poor that we will not return. Our suite was large enough, but it was dirty, dated and worn. The bed linens were stained and the bathroom did not appear to have been cleaned properly. Public hall areas had room service trays sitting for two days, disgusting. We (politely) requested housekeeping to touch up our room and pick up trays and they never showed. We had paid for the King Tut Package, which was supposed to include tickets to the exhibit. They had no record of this and didn't honor it. Of course, the exhibit was sold out, so our main reason for visiting Chicago was ruined as we weren't able to see this part of the Field museum.

The 'view' was of the 'inner courtyard' of nothing but walls of windows of the other rooms. You were unable to determine what the weather was outside except that it was either day or night. They no longer have in-room coffee appliances. You either have to go down to their ostentatious dining room, or go around the corner to Starbucks or McDonald's. Internet access is not free ($12.95/24 hours), the ""Gift Shop"" is a joke (tucked away in the corner of the coat check room, Concierge services have limited hours, and the business center is open only during 'business hours' which made it difficult to get work done after 'business hours.""

The room was okay, not worth what I paid for. The sheets were kind of messed up and the room didn't feel very clean. They also charge for internet access, which is ridiculous. Most hotels provide free wi-fi. The conference food, which I assume is catered by the hotel, was not good at all. On the day of the check out, I had arranged for a late check-out, but in the morning before check-out time, someone else got assigned to my room and was attempting to get in! Then they locked me out of my room with my luggage still in there before my check out time. All in all, I would recommend staying somewhere else.",0,nan,ta_n325
trip_advisor,"As a frequent traveler for work, I stay at many SPG properties. Compared to all the SPG property in Chicago, this is by far the worst. Why? 1) They charge you to use the gym. $12 per day or something like $24 for your entire stay. I can't even begin on what a rip off that is. 2) As a Gold or Platinum member, you always get a complimentary water bottle in your room. They do not offer that option here and you have to make a fuss about it before they give you one. 3) They do not have wireless internet. It is 2010- enough said. To charge you at least over $200 a night, all the above amenities should be built into that cost. I would never stay here again.",0,nan,ta_n326

Secondly I booked 8 rooms at buy 2 get 3rd room free direct with hotel. When I looked a week later, they had only booked 7 and refused to offer me the rate 3rd room free rate, so two of my friends didn't come to the trip away. Thirdly I asked if the initial money for all rooms could be taken ASAP as the dollar was weak against the pound. After about 8 phone calls over 5 months (each saying they would) they eventually took the money and the whole trip cost an additional PS150.

I chilled there until 8pm, no call, so went out for dinner. Came back at 9:30pm and asked if my room was ready. The gal said of course yes and give me a key. When asked why no one called me, she just shrugged. No, my troubles did not end there. I went to the room and opened the door only to find someone else in the room. Came back to the lobby, then they apologized and gave me another room. I said I was not going to walk-in on somebody else again, so they sent someone with me to open the new room.

The guy at the main door didn't even hold it open when you are trying to lug your bags into the lobby, we then had to que for 15-20 minutes just to check in. We were not given any information about the hotel and when I rang down to reception at one stage to find out if there was a business centre in the hotel that I could access the Internet through, I was just short of being asked why didn't I bring my lap-top with me so I could use the Internet access in the room.... !!

trip_advisor,"I have traveled to Chicago many times for business, and so I have expectations of hotels based on reasonable comparisons. There was nothing dramatically wrong the Sheraton, but it was simply overpriced for the quality of the hotel. It almost looked as if an accountant walk through the hotel looking for places to cut costs. The carpets were old, there was only one bar of soap in the bathroom, towels and linens were older than I expected, the rooms were in need of some redecorating, etc. during the week I was paying $349 per night for a room, and it simply was not near the quality I expected for that price. One positive to notice that the fitness room was quite good. Plenty of aerobic machines with TVs, weights, etc. location is also quite good (perhaps the reason for the high price) with close walks to Michigan Avenue and the river. In summary, I think you can find a much nicer hotel in a much better price in downtown Chicago.",0,nan,ta_n335
trip_advisor,"My wife and I stayed here for a weekend in Chicago and had an okay experience. The location contrary to other reviews is not very good for a downtown Chicago hotel. Everything is at least a fifteen minute walk which in the winter in Chicago means a taxi ride. The other thing that you should know about this hotel is that they allow smoking everywhere. I don't necessarily mind people smoking but the lobby, the elevator lobbies and any area that was public had tons of people smoking and ashtrays everywhere. The pool/spa/excercise room was not very impressive either. It is accessible by walking through the business center corridor, wondering if you're going the right way and then coming to a pool that is extremely small. There is also no hot tub and the ""spa"" is a closet with a massage table. The concierge was helpful but the people that answer the ""sheraton promise"" phone told me that there was nothing they could do about ice being out on two floors. The beds were super comfortable. I think that this is probably a nice business hotel with top of the line conference and meeting facilities but for couples or families you can do MUCH better in downtown Chicago.",0,nan,ta_n336

On the plus side, the hotel is reasonably well located, within a few minutes walk of Michigan Avenue. My room had a superb view out over the river. However, for the price I must say that the room look decidedly shabby and worn and is in need of refurbishment. The decor was dated, and my bathroom unit was cracked and the shower rail rusty. The wifi is ridiculously expensive, and frustratingly as a conference delegate I was unable to use the service downstairs in the venue despite having paid for 24 hours access.

trip_advisor,"I had my wedding ceremony and reception at the Sofitel. It seems as though I had the same experience as ""Judy L."" I read her review and thought ""that's exactly what happened to me!"" Here's what happened: The good news: The actual event was great. Most notably, the food was absolutely incredible; I think almost every one of our guests has raved to us about the food. The same goes for the cake, which was made by Take the Cake. The service by the waiters and other staff was also very good. The bad news: Michelle, the Director of Catering, honestly made my wedding planning process a nightmare. While we were negotiating the contract, she promptly responded to my emails and phone calls; after the contract was signed, it was a constant struggle to get in touch with her to get my questions answered, to schedule the tasting, etc. She frequently took over a week to respond to a simple email, and she occasionally never returned my email or phone call until I called her a second or third time. I assumed things would get better within the month--or even the week--prior to my wedding, but they actually got even worse. Michelle just could not get it together, and if it weren't for my wedding coordinator's assistance in forcing her to finally get things right, I don't know what would have happened. Thus, if it weren't for Michelle's inability to do her job, I would have had a great experience.

After doing so, I immediately heard a Sofitel doorman yelling for me to stop and then heard the sound of his whistle. As the cab slowed to pick me up, the doorman continued to yell at me and blow his whistle as he started to run in my direction.

After claiming that he had hotel customers waiting for cabs, he suggested that I had no right to hail a cab in the vicinity of the hotel and then called me a ""jerk"" before allowing the cab driver to depart to my destination. Consequently, unless you enjoy being accosted by hotel doormen, please don't attempt to hail a cab anywhere near the hotel under any circumstances without first securing the permission of a doorman. Lastly, as for the rest of my stay, you will enjoy this hotel if you seek a highly pretentious staff who prefer to speak to guests in French instead of English.

trip_advisor,My wife and I frequently stay downtown for a night in the city. We have been to many hotels in the downtown Chicago area. My opinion of the Swissotel - spend your money elsewhere and get a much better experience. The Swissotel has a very 'cold' atmosphere and its very difficult to feel comfortable. The room was average at best however the cost per night was far from average. The view from our room faced a construction site which is a soon to be trump building that will block the lake view from the hotel. Other hotels are also a couple blocks closer to the action and again for the cost we would expect more. Our room and the lobby areas had a strange smell and someone was actually vacuuming the hallway floors at 8:00a which woke us up. We called the front desk to complain and were extremely shocked to be treated rudely by the person at the desk. We also had a couple of friends come downtown and they were waiting in the lobby when they were approached by a gentleman asking if they were guests of the hotel. They said no but that they were waiting on us and he actually asked them what our names were and then they looked it up to verify that we were on the guest register. He didnt even apologize to them for the inconvenience and imbarrassment. Overall it was just an unpleasant experience because we were expecting top notch treatment.

Food wise, we had chicken BOTH times for lunch (maybe my company was saving some $) but they should at least prepare them differently. It looked like they did the same style chicken but change the underlying ""bed"" upon which it is served. For dinner, we had filet mignon and crab cake. Sounds good right? Wrong! The filet mignon seems to be 1/2 the thickness of what I have seen and it was tough. I thought the filet mignon is suppose to be tenderest part of the cow???? Also, the crab cakes was a bit too salty. Finally the portions were tiny and left me lacking. In asking my co-worker, most seem to be blase about the food. However, some seem to like the burger (which they went to substitute) at the Palms, which is a restaurant inside the hotel, just off the lobby. On the positive note, the dessert for dinner was good. Otherwise, I'd recommend another hotel. In the meantime, when I got home, I make sure to bring EVERYTHING straight to the washer/dryer to disinfect (even strip down). But, damn, I'm still itchin'",0,nan,ta_n363
trip_advisor,"Three nights there on business. Hadn't realized that the place was under construction and therefore the bar and restaurant are in the basement, very bleak. Told the front desk that I hadn't realized about the construction, so I'd have to switch hotels, they said they were still going to charge me for 3 nights. So I stayed. TV didn't work. Tried to get them to fix it and they ignored me...eventually after I called again, a few hours later, a couple grumpy maintanance guys came and fixed it. Long and complicated experience at the business center (which doesn't open until 9am, BTW), where I ended up paying $45 to print 55 pages. Had to buy these cards, and then the woman behind the desk ended up printing them herself anyway, (and charging me for them). I was left with $22 on a card for use at the business center in the basement of the Swissotel in Chicago, 2000 miles from where I live. I asked for a refund on the card and -- no surprise -- she declined to help me with that. Nice room, nice view, but the hotel is sterile and the service was incredibly bad. Worst experience I've ever had at a hotel when traveling for business.",0,nan,ta_n364
trip_advisor,"I would NOT recommend staying at the Swissotel in Chicago. I was travelling with a friend and we arrived at different times. She had booked the hotel but had added my name to the reservation since I would be arriving first. The ""night manager"" at the hotel was extremely rude and told me I could not check in since they could not find the note about my name being on the reservation. (this was THEIR mistake) They told me I could sit in the lobby for 4 hours until my friend arrived. They did nothing to try and help me until I stood there and complained for twenty minutes. I can't believe that a ""manager"" would treat a customer this way. There are other great hotels in Chicago. This hotel is not worth the aggravation!",0,nan,ta_n365
trip_advisor,"The elevator system was impossible. It seems they were trying to improve it but only made it worse. Many people waited 15+ minutes and some bailed out to the stair wells. It happened several times. I had read about it before booking but guess I didn't take it seriously. It'd be a deal breaker for any future return unless I heard clearly it was improved.

trip_advisor,"Over all, my trip was great; I got to spend time with my best friend. We did some shopping and site seeing. Trip was overall great. The only thing was our hotel stay was not up to speed with other luxury hotels I have stayed at. Some of the walls had wall paper missing, most of the faucets leaked, there was water stains on the ceiling in the bathrooms, some of the furniture had very visible stains, the fire alarm was coming off the wall in the main bedroom. we stayed in the corner suite on the 37 floor room 3711.

This location is notorious for having super sensitive scales on the mini fridge, so when you barely touch it you'll get a bill at 3 in the morning under your door.

Is it just me, or is this information not clearly stated on their website? A giant tarp where a lobby should have been was pretty weird and unwelcoming. The room itself was fine. More bland and generic than the ""European elegance"" claimed on their website. The lack of hot water, was definitely not fine though. There were a couple pluses to our stay at Swissotel. The location is good, the bed was comfortable and the room was clean.

trip_advisor,"Swisses Chicago: Nice, but lacking in some pretty basic expectations in our modern era in a great spot along the Chicago waterfront. A spacious room is a comfortable respite from the city, but don't plug in your computer or hope for a free donut in the morning. No free WiFi here ,or affordable breakfast, or a free swim in the pool. Just a ten-dollar-a-night charge for internet, an on average $25 plate for breakfast, and another 15 bucks a night for the ""fitness center."" I've stayed in small town no star motels where WiFi is free as part of a 50 dollar room. Get with it - this is 2009! No free breakfast is not so bad as you probably ate too much for dinner and don't need it anyway, but for those of us who aren't charging everything to the company card some basics would be appreciated. Coffee, milk, OJ; stale donuts, ,muffins, maybe some cereal. Throw us a little something besides fruit flavored water in the lobby. With regards to swimming, this is another one wrapped up in a fitness center fee but the pool is only open till 10 pm plan accordingly.

trip_advisor,"Just wanted to let everyone know if you are looking for a hotel with high rise construction next door the Swissotel Chicago is the one for you. My wife and I went there last year and there was just an empty lot next door, this year there is a loud construction site next door. So 8 am Saturday morning you will hear the workers starting. I am sure once the summer in Chicago comes around they will work all night. Just think as they keep adding floors you will be able to look the workers in the eye and wave from your room that used to have a view of the Navy Pier. Now you will get an up close and personal view of people pouring concrete. On top of it the hotel is doing construction of there own. The front of the hotel is block and lucky for us the protestors that are standing in front of the hotel were able to tell use where the new entrance was. The protestors were there because the Swissotel hired a company to redo their sound system that does not hire union workers. If you ask the workers about the noise and they say we can't hear it. I am sure the Swissotel does not want word getting out about this. If you insist on trying it for yourself don't pay for your room in advance they will not let you out of the room and then you are stuck.",0,nan,ta_n374

However, my bed was against the wall abutting the elevator shaft, and I heard the elevators running all night. Also held a one-day conference there for 25 people. They stuck us in a long, narrow room that was cramped. Also, the night before we had a pre-conference dinner at the Palm restaurant in the hotel.

In any case, I want to take a nice hot soak and--guess what--they are having water problems... SOOOOO disappointed. Hopefully I don't get bug bitten this time (checked under the sheets). Sadly, due to my company's deal, I think I have to stay here again next year *sigh*...but so far they are batting 1 star.... -------------- Oh boy, it must be my luck...or rather this hotel is just run down. I had to swap room FOUR TIMES. And that's for a Thurs nite-Sunday morning stay. My first room had no hot water so I had to switch rooms. They gave me the key to the 2nd room, which happened to be occupied. Luckily the occupants had their security latch on, so there wasn't any embarrassing moment. My third room was fine for 2 nights but then today (just now) I had to move because of water leakage (above my room and below my room). BOY, talk about an awful hotel (or my just awful luck???? Maybe it's karma since I wrote a bad review last year, and continue to write one...but it's the TRUTH). Oh, also last year may not have been bed bugs. I have checked the room and it looks bug free but I STILL get these itchy patches on my leg.

trip_advisor,"We chose to stay at a small hotel because we did were looking for a hotel with less crowds. We anticipated we would get better service in a smaller hotel, than some of the other larger high rise hotels. We did not experience very good service at the Talbott Hotel. When we checked Irena seemed very robotic and aloof. The front desk clerks were neither welcoming nor gracious. The lobby is small and the front desk is just a few feet from the front door. Each time we came into the hotel we were never greeted nor even received a smile from the staff, just a blank stare and gaze. The front desk staff was chilly and stiff, no greetings, no smiles and no personality. They had difficulty answering simple questions or requests. On the other hand the bellman Perry was great. He was sociable and very service oriented. He was aware of what is going on in the area. He recognizes the guests and he offered suggestions about things to do in the immediate area, and where to eat in the neighborhood. He is authentic and he even asked us upon our return ""how was that restaurant?"" Tim the concierge was also supportive. He gave us 10% discount coupons for shopping at the major department stores. We had the largest suite. We requested a rollaway (extra charge) when we made our reservation and we had to ask five different times to have the rollaway bed delivered to our room before it came after 10PM. When the rollaway finally came we had to call back the front desk because they did not deliver a blanket or pillow with the bed. What made our Talbott hotel experience most disappointing was that we may have never received any housekeeping unless we had asked to have our room cleaned. We were out of our room from 8AM and when we returned to our room at 4PM the rooms had not been cleaned. We called the front desk to ask to send someone. The maid rushed to clean our room while we had to shower and change for the evening. The room itself was pleasant. It did have a moldy smell and some Frabreez would have been nice to bring along since the windows do not open much. We were next to a noisy neighbor and the walls were thin. We really liked staying in this area of Chicago but expected first rate service. The service was very weak and unacceptable for this class of hotel.",0,nan,ta_n381
trip_advisor,"I am not much of a complainer, as you can see when reviewing my other posts on this site, but the Talbott provided such bad service that I feel the need to warn future travelers to Chicago: My girlfriend and I stayed at the Talbott for 2 nights in late July 2006. The first sign that something was wrong come during the initial booking of the room over the phone. The receptionist was outright rude, but took the reservation without a mistake. During our stay the hotel and restaurant staff was extraordinary incompetent, the waiters, the managers, nobody was friendly, nor tied to accommodate us. [------------------------] We and many others who stayed at the hotel attended a wedding reception close by and had arranged the hotel bar to remain open from 12-2 to have an after hour's party. The hotel manager had assured us that this was secured and done in the past upon such occasions. When we returned from the reception at 11:50pm the bar was closing and the night manager and hotel staff were very rude to me and my friends. ""Nobody told us, we can't do anything for you."" ""Are you sure that you arranged this?"" Two quotes so typical for this hotel's staff that I know that I will never stay at this hotel again. I understand that mistakes are made and that communication can be difficult across different shifts in a hotel, but blaming the customer so being confused and failing to arrange what I know had been arranged for and was later confirmed by the day staff is too rude even for my taste.[-----]",0,nan,ta_n382
trip_advisor,"Avoid The Talbot, especially for group functions. My in-laws spent a great deal of time trying to find just the right hotel to use for our wedding party and several out of town guests. They were lured in by promises from The Talbot, that since they were a small boutique hotel that they could provide ""special, personal treatment"". Nothing could have been further from the truth. They failed to honor two requests to keep the bar open after our reception, they persistently confused reservation requests, they front desk failed to contact the valet despite multiple requests and nearly caused of my guests, his wife, and his two year old daughter to miss their departing flight. Now the worse part. Mistakes are made, even hotel managers are human, but where a hotel, which is supposed to be in the hospitality service, can distinguish itself is in how they handle and correct the error. Case in point: I had requested on several occasions when I made the reservations for my family that they all be placed under my credit card, all expenses, they assurred me that this would be no problem. Of course, when my brother, his wife, and asthmatic five year old arrived to searing hot and humid Chicago after six hours of travel they wouldn't let them check in until they physically saw my card... again despite them having my card on record, and despite my explaining this to them over the phone. My brother recalls the ""indignation"" of the desk clerk when he mentioned that the charges were to be put on my card. Then Another guest, in this case my older brother, came by and put the charges onto his card so that the five year old could escape the heat and the prolonged waiting in the lobby. When I finally was able to get across town, leaving a Cubs game early, I again spoke to them about putting all the charges on my account. Again they agreed, but never did anything about it. In the end when my older brother checked out on Sunday he was told everything was alright, but when he went to his ATM his account was frozen from ""unathorized overuse"". The hotel kept billing his debit card automatically for multiple charges ubtil his account was essentially drained. When he got home he had to take an entire day off to discuss with his bank how to rectify these events. I spent Sunday afternoon for an hour and three hours on Monday, the first two days of my honeymoon on the phone, calling The Talbot, the credit card fraud division, my brother, etc trying to solve this situation. The most aggregious insults continued to come form the covering manager, who at one point suggested that ""I was mistaken about coming back down to talk with the desk clerk about these matters"".... this was a witnessed event, and her insinuation was that I was lying, and that there was no way her clerk could have made a mistake. In the end, there is no one running this place... managers from one department refer you to the manager of another departments voice mail. When I was finally able to get the name of the general manager (after two days)m neither he nor his assistant would ever call back. The communication between the staff and mangement is non-existant. Fortuneatly the staff at the Signature Room (where we had the reception) was beyond excellent so the day was not lost, but the The Talbot went out of its way to insult and poorly serve my family and many of our wedding guests.

trip_advisor,"The Talbott Hotel itself is a bit worn around the edges. No - not a bit worn - very much so I'm sorry to say. Although the location a block and a half from the best part of Michigan Ave. can't be beat, and the level of service is on par with many Four Seasons, there were quite a few bumps in the road. Number one, the rooms are quite dreary - brown on brown is just so not pleasing. The desk chair was so badly worn that the ""lift"" button simply swirled down when you sat in it and no we're not grossly obese. The back of the chair leaned so much it was uncomfortable. My husband had to use 2 couch pillows to use it - one to get him up to desk heighth, one up against his back to scoot him up to the desk. The bathroom was oddly arranged so that the door swung up right next to the sink, so if you were using the far sink and someone needed to enter the bathroom you got hit with the door. The towels were very well worn and thin, although bath sized, which was a plus. The restaurant downstairs is practically another posting - suffice to say, it was horrific. We had some appetizers outside on the nice streetside tables, and they (appetizers) were awful and looked as though a child had tossed them together in the kitchen. A room service sandwich ordered later in our visit was totally wet on the side, served on a large white plate, and was one slice of meat and one slice of plastic American cheese on a grocery store-like roll - very very sad. Even the menu, as limited as it was, looked as though someone's child had written it out. The good news is that Chicago is a fairly well-read restaurant town so there are plenty of other places to go. Unfortunately for us, the 3 days we stayed there was a large convention and jazz festival in town so we paid $325/nt for our disappointments. The good news is that the mini bars' wares were incredibly well-priced - when's the last time you had a $4 beer anywhere in a hotel? (even if it was Bud and Bud lite - lol!~) The front desk and curbside staff could not have been more accommodating. The water out of the shower was hot and plentiful, and the bed comfortable. The A/C was not noisy nor uncomfortable whatsoever, and we had it going the entire time as it was in the 90's our entire stay. Free wi-fi - YES! And it wasn't horribly grindingly slow! No need for the advertised ""upgrade"" for faster wi-fi. Talbott - please update your rooms and get a new restaurant concept and you will be ahead of the game.

trip_advisor,"I selected the Talbott after 3 hrs comparing hotels online. We have had wonderful experiences with boutiques (Monaco, Allegro) and assumed this would be comparable. Good points: the lobby is beautiful, and one staff member took roses I bought for my wife and arranged them nicely. The many problems: When my wife called with a question on our arrival day, the agent could find no reservation -- 15 mins later she was transferred to another person who found the record instantly. When we arrived, the lobby was stuffed with students; nobody tried to manage the group, several of whom pushed ahead to the check-in desk. We left our bags and went out for 2 hrs so we could check in with less hassle. We finally were checked in, after waiting 15 mins while the confused desk clerk searched for rooms. When we got there, our room had not been made up from the last guest. When we complained, we were given an ""upgrade"" to a room that was old and uninspired. Chairs are scuffed, closet shelves are bowed, the air conditioner is noisy, and a wall lamp is loose. The view is of a construction site. Movies-on-demand are dated. We expect this from a budget hotel, not one positioning itself as elegant and upscale. When we returned after an evening out, the card reader to open the main doors did not work. One staff member admonished us (really) for not using the reader, when in fact we had tried. This was embarrassing, as others were standing in the lobby. I tried to access the hotel's wifi network, but was only given a $9.95 upgrade option. I called the desk, and was told to ""click past it"", which of course did nothing. It wasn't until 2 hrs later the complimentary access worked. We are pretty easygoing; we love good treatment and tip handsomely. If we had only 1or 2 problems, we wouldn't write. In fact, we would not have written except the hotel did not make things right. The president wrote a letter, and suggested others at the hotel would be in touch...nobody ever was.",0,nan,ta_n385

trip_advisor,"If you asked me two years ago, I would have recommended the Talbott Hotel without hesitation to anyone who asked. Now, I have definitely changed my mind. While this hotel is located in a nice area of Chicago, surrounded by great restaurants, shops and affluent people, it has really begun to slowly downgrade. As noted by my reviews, I am incredibly serious about customer service. If you're in the hospitality industry, there is really no excuse for falling short in this category--- but alas, the Talbott really has. The door staff don't say a word, the desk people acknowledge you only when they are not doing a million other things (which they always are) and the staff have an air of snobbishness. Inexcusable since we, the customers, are paying to stay at their over-priced hotel. Perhaps the most annoying aspect of my latest stay was that I had to walk down 11 flights of stairs to get to the lobby of the hotel because I waited a solid 15 minutes for the elevator, which, when it arrived, was packed to the brim. I get that it's an old hotel, but it is incredibly annoying that they only have two elevators for the entire place and when one is down for construction, the other one overflows with people and I am forced to walk ELEVEN flights to simply get to my dinner reservation on time (which I didn't.) I will not continue giving this hotel my business and have other better recommendations to give to friends who plan on visiting.",0,nan,ta_n387
trip_advisor,"I was very much looking forward to our stay at this hotel, after hearing all the good things about it. Unfortunately, it was a very underwhelming experience, to say the least. But let me begin with the things that I do like about the hotel. First off, it is located my favorite part of Chicago - the leafy, affluent part of town that is Chicago's equivalent of Manhattan's Upper East Side, complete with sidewalks, quiet tree-lined streets, real old-school townhouses (instead of ugly towering monstrosities that are 21st century condominiums), cute boutiques (instead of Gap, Banana Republic and other mainstream mass-produced brands) and, of course, Hermes of Paris (which warrants a separate mention). I also like the small intimate lobby area with old leather couches, cherry colored wooden furnitures, area rugs and distinct artwork. The very reason why I always tend to gravitate toward smaller boutique hotels instead of impersonal chains. I definitely love the room. While the space issue is not as bad in Chicago as it is in Manhattan, getting a 400-sqft guestroom for our weekend getaway is not an easy task. So we were delighted to see that our room comes with generous, ample bathroom, double sink, massive king bed AND still enough space to walk around, do a chicken dance, and strut my Herve and Louboutins in. My only reservation was the lack of natural light - the windows were definitely inadequate to allow sunlight to find its way into our 11th-floor room, but then again Delaware St is not exactly the widest street in town and there are buildings in front of us, so can't have it all! Yet one thing that really disappointed us was the service, or lack thereof. I mean, seriously. They don't call it the 'hospitality' industry for no reason. I did pay a premium to stay in smaller boutique hotels such as this so I do get a service that is a little bit more personalized than the kind that I would be getting from say, a 3000-room Vegas hotel. First, I called in to reconfirm my reservation. The lady on the phone was anything but courteous and competent. First off, she was not able to find my reservation and I was transferred to the front desk staff, to whom I had to explain myself all over again (my pet peeve when it comes to on-the-phone customer service). The person who manned the reception desk was not friendly, nor was he at all competent either. Case in point - he had to send the slip of paper on which I agree to the nightly rate and duration of stay up to the room after we checked in, which clearly indicated that he must have forgotten when we were actually down there. But the real kicker was when we ordered room service after arriving - it was about 1AM. As a general rule, I am never, ever, a big fan of room service, having had my fair share of bad food that they slap 18% gratuity, 10.5% tax (and still expect a tip) on during my days globetrotting on the company's expense account. Think overcooked steaks, lukewarm soup, bread hard enough to knock someone out, and ice-creams that are already half melted by the time it reaches your suite. So I really wasn't expecting hotels as small as Talbott to have a 24-hour room service, but lo and behold, they do. I placed an order of chicken BLT, which (to my initial delight) came in within 20 minutes. Then after the customary of the invoice and the involuntary yet customary tip of $2 on top of the 18% service fee (refer above) I opened the cover only to find something that looked like it was picked up from the garbage bin, microwaved and served on a plate with a bag of Lay's chips (lightly salted flavor). The bread looked like someone stomped on it, the L and T looked like it was 2 days old, the B was unrecognizable, and the chicken was burnt and cold. It was pathetic room service at its finest. We did get the item taken off our bill (rightfully so too) but the front desk person was, instead of apologetic, defiant. The whole thing was just very upsetting and for a hotel as high-end as this to be able to leave such a bad impression within the first hour of arriving, it's quite an accomplishment in and of itself. We won't be coming back, unfortunately.",0,nan,ta_n388
trip_advisor,"I had requested a quiet room several weeks in advance, yet was given a room facing the street from which I could hear traffic noise. I asked to be moved and was told that nothing was available until the next day. The next morning, prior to being moved to a quiet room, the toilet in my original room overflowed creating a large unsanitary flood. About an hour later I was moved to a room which did not face the street. The room was quiet but smaller and darker. The mattresses in each room were very firm, I would even say hard. I asked if any softer mattresses were available and was told that the mattresses were all the same. At checkout I tried to give the hotel a form of payment that differed from the card the room was reserved under, and this process was still not done correctly after 10 minutes, which seemed longer because the van to the airport was waiting right outside, with other passengers. (The cost was not correctly charged until almost a week later.) As recompense for the noise, flood, etc., the hotel offered exactly nothing. Not a great stay.",0,nan,ta_n389
trip_advisor,"If location is the only thing that matters, stay at the Talbott. However, my wife and I have travelled extensively throughout North America and Europe, and I have never, in my entire life, seen such an inept housekeeping staff. They are unprofessional, noisy, incompetent and better suited for a one star hotel. They were yelling in the halls, slamming doors, and taking far too long to clean each room. They come to your room several times to check the fridge where they sell bottles of water for $3. The hotel was being renovated when we were staying there so we also had to endure the construction work - no discount was offered even after we complained several times. The front desk staff was very polite, but who cares?They're supposed to be nice. I spent a lot of money to stay here and did not feel that I received a fair deal. The room was sub-par for the price, even for an inner city hotel. Stay somewhere else and have a better vacation.",0,nan,ta_n390
trip_advisor,"I'm sitting in the hotel as I right this review and am not impressed with the room. The hotel is not modern in the least - it feels like you're staying in your grandmother's attic. Wallpaper is peeling off the wall, not well lit, very few outlets in the room -- especially convenient ones (none next to the bed or built into lamps), terrible views and loud construction noises woke me up at 7am. Even the location is off the beaten path - closest L stop is on the Red Line -- so not accessible via the loop stops on the blue line from the airport without transferring. Health club is not on site either. There are hundreds of other hotels I would stay in over this one.",0,nan,ta_n391
trip_advisor,"Any traveler who is loyal to a favorite hotel has experienced this sad truth: eventually the lodging deteriorates. But you do not expect the price to double and triple at the same time! I have been staying at the Talbott for several decades. Yes, changes have been made, like the updated heating and cooling systems and the front entrance, most recently. But other things have gone downhill. For the last several stays I have experienced very dirty carpets and slow service. Rates have skyrocketed and now they are asking for 3 night minimum stays on many occasions. This is the kind of rate structure one might expect from the 5 star hotels within spitting distance of The Talbott, but not this less-than-maintained lodging. I, personally, am shopping for a new home away from home.",0,nan,ta_n392
trip_advisor,"I booked two rooms four months in advance at the Talbott. We were placed on the top floor next to the elevators, which are used all night long. When speaking to the front desk, I was told that they were simply honoring my request for an upper floor, which I had requested for a better view. I am looking at a brick wall, and getting no sleep. He also told me that they had received complaints before from guests on the 16th floor, and were aware of the noise problem. Why then did they place us on this floor when the hotel is not totally booked? A request for an upper floor does not constitute placing someone on the TOP floor and using that request to justify this. If you decide to stay here, request a room on a lower floor and away from the elevator! I spoke at length when booking my two rooms about my preferences. This is simply poor treatment of a guest whom they believed would not complain.",0,nan,ta_n393
trip_advisor,"I found this hotel in the ""Small Luxury Hotels of the World"" booklet having stayed in many of these in recent years, and they were indeed above and beyond average hotels. I therefore chose it for a 4 night stay while visiting from England. The Talbott was excellently located, although i had a view of a building site, and did have an ambience and some charm, however it was a little dirty and faded around the edges and the service was appalling. I had to wait in the foyer well after check in time, having previously attempted to check in earlier, tired and in need of a rest, while a ""final check"" was done to my room. The valet parking was not outside when requested, breakfast was not included in the price, all the things requested of reception did not occur, and there were very few touches which make a hotel stay special. I have stayed in hotels which are so much more elegant, where the staff and service are first rate for half the price of this hotel. I was severely disappointed and cannot recommend it at all.",0,nan,ta_n394
trip_advisor,"I have stayed in the Talbott a few times and had always liked it. This time was my first visit in 2 years and I was disappointed. The hallways are now looking tired and the carpets need to be replaced. I had asked for a corner room but instead was given a small and very dark room looking out onto a wall 10 feet away with multiple noisy vents immediately outside the window. The lights had to be kept on throughout the day even through the days were bright. The bathroom was tiny and would be difficult to manage with 2 people in the room. The AC unit rumbled on permanently with background white noise even when switched off. Having stayed there before I know there are better rooms but this one was the same price as the others I have been in and the risk is getting it again. Other small things contributed - the lobby brownies are no longer, there were no cup lids for the lobby coffee (so you couldn't walk out with the coffee) and I got a newspaper only on the last morning of a 5-night stay. The construction noise was not too bad but does start at 7.30am and goes on until around 8pm, including weekends.",0,nan,ta_n395
trip_advisor,"We reserved a room with a sleeper couch a few weeks before our stay. After checking in and unpacking, we discovered that the sleeper sofa had been removed (supposedly during renovation). The front desk clerk and bellman never mentioned that there was no sleeper sofa even though they saw all 4 of us check into the room. Colleen, one of the managers, was argumentative and did nothing to resolve the problem. We ended up having one of our children sleep on the couch and the other slept on an antiquated rollaway bed. We never spoke to the general manager who was conveniently ""absent from the hotel"" during most of our stay. We stayed here on more than one occasion over the past decade and had never encountered such incompetence. We had to make several phone calls to receive a miserly discount and we never received an apology. The lack of training of the staff was clearly evident, as was the cavalier attitude of the management.",0,nan,ta_n396
trip_advisor,"I can easily say this is one of the worst hotels I've stayed at the. The receptionist up front was a snooty, sarcastic teenager or post teenager. You can get better service from a waiter or waitress at a diner. The room was dirty, stains on the carpet, the showerhead was moldy and rusted, the doors of the bathroom and main door all had dents and scratches. The towels had a horrible aroma. The hotel is very narrow, so we were near a construction zone so, I would plan on waking up at 6:am if you choose the Talbott. The next day, I asked for another room and the concierge who was a decent guy moved us to a larger more comfortable room. That room though was right by the elevator and it was torture hearing the sounds of the elevator which just would never stop. I asked for late checkout at 1pm and the receptionist refused stating that we would be charged for a half day, if were not out by noon. I had to speak to the manager who gave us till 1pm. Please stay away from this hotel, I think a Holiday Inn would be better. Andrew F. Gulli",0,nan,ta_n397
trip_advisor,"Just back from spending Memorial Day weekend in Chicago. We decided to stay at the Talbott, and we reserved a room there over a month ago. I must say that we found the staff to be wonderful, but the accommodations to be quite disappointing. We were given room #1605. Avoid this room at all costs! The adjacent elevator is so noisy that it will keep you awake most of the night (and then awaken you at 6 AM). In addition, we had requested a king bed, and #1605 has two doubles. We were also surprised that there was no coffee maker in the room. Despite the very friendly staff and its super location, the Talbott was less than what we expected, and we would probably not stay there again.",0,nan,ta_n398
trip_advisor,"I can't recall another time I've had to deal with such rude front desk help. While pleasant initially, as soon as I demonstrated the slightest bit of frustration that I was still waiting to claim my luggage for check-in (I arrived prior to check-in time, so they were holding a few bags), the true quality of this establishment surfaced. Never mind that the luggage wasn't sent up to our room in the afternoon or that i waited in the lobby for 15 minutes at 7:30pm still looking for my luggage or at least a bellhop. While that was a bit annoying, the worst part was witnessing the poor attitude of Donna, the very attractive but aloof front desk employee. Her lack of initiative was only matched by her pettiness, as I noticed she refused to make eye contact with me for the remainder of my stay, including when my family came down to the lobby the following morning. I also booked a rate that included parking, which Donna acknowledged at check-in but at check out billed me separately; I assume after I got on her bad side. Even with my last polite good bye to the front desk, I felt a phony, uppity attitude from Donna, and I really can't convey the extent of how insulting it felt. I can honestly say it was the worst part of my first trip to Chicago. The hotel is well appointed and the lobby was small but cozy. Great location as well. To be fair, most of the staff seemed very friendly, and I am not so obtuse as to not recognize my rating of this hotel is a statistical outlier. But I think most travelers, like me, would trade a few amenities for consistent and reliable service, so as to not have a ""situation"" that could single-handedly ruin a travel experience. Unfortunately, that was the case here.",0,nan,ta_n399
trip_advisor,"I was completely blown away by this hotel. It was magnificent. I got a great deal and I am so happy that I stayed here. Before arriving I was nervous as I had read a few bad reviews about the impact the renovation was having on peoples stay, for example very noisy. However, whilst the renovation was still going on and the gym was not open nor the restaurant, it made no difference to me. My room was huge, bathroom was spacious with excellent water pressure, bed was perfect and the view was amazing.

trip_advisor,"We've just returned from a two night stay at the Affinia Chicago and our visit was delightful. Thanks to tripadvisor reviews we were prepared for the major construction work on the facade and entrance..it was a mess. And the hotel restaurant and bar remain incomplete and unavailable. Even parts of the lobby had ""wet paint"" stickers. All these things could have made for a disappointing stay. Not so!! Although we arrived very early in the day our suite was ready along with a most warm and gracious greeting from the front desk staff. After just a few minutes we felt like we were ""at home."" The suite on the 25th floor, with a fab view along a wall of windows, was sparkling fresh and clean. The bathroom lighting was outstanding and led to my bride of nearly 50 years saying that it made her look younger...she was right! Everything in and about the room was ""like-new"" and very stylish. As a visitor we appreciated the very convenient location just a few steps from the Magnificient Mile and all of its ambiance. Thanks to a dedicated and gracious staff, a fantastic location, and chic decorating elements, this hotel can and will be our future hotel of choice in Chicago. The stay was short..but sweet.",1,nan,ta_p1
trip_advisor,"Excellent location, feels like a boutique hotel. Right next to Neiman Marcus (V.expensive dept store) and 2 mins walk to John Hancock tower. As most American ,medium to high end, hotels service was excellent from the bellhop to reception. Upgrade to a suite if you are staying longer than a couple of days as walking around the windy city can be tiring and a suite feels like a small apartment. The pub in the basement is good for a sandwich and a Beer. They will be refurbing so take adavantage of lower rates now as I feel they will be going for very high end clients after the remodelling",1,nan,ta_p2

The Affinia in Chicago has raised my expectations and W Hotels are going to suffer in comparison. This hotel is one of the cleanest I have stayed at in some time. Service was impeccable. Friendly front-desk staff and the extra towels I ordered arrived literally within minutes. The gym has new equipment with plenty of space. And such a fun vibe - without dark hallways and loud music. I have to thank the other reviewers - their reviews led me to the Affinia and I was so pleased. My new ""Chicago Hotel"". It will even lead me to try the Manhattan hotels.",1,nan,ta_p3

trip_advisor,"As others have said, once all the construction works are completed I suspect that the prices this hotel can (legitimately) charge will put it out of our price range. Which will be a pity because it is an excellent hotel, & the location couldn't be better. The room was very spacious, with separate sitting & study areas & a nice bathroom. Only 3 minor points: downstairs they were serving a free basic breakfast (coffee & pastries), but we only knew of it on our last morning - nobody had mentioned this; the cost of internet - $9.99 - is a bit dear especially when lots of motels now offer it free; there was only powered milk in the rooms, which wasn't that nice.

It has a 4 star resturant which we enjoyed in a relaxed atmosphere an amazing Italian meal. The wine list is one of the best in a city of great restaurants. The Kimptons have a social hour 5 to 6 with wine at all of their hotels. You sit in a designer, kind of London circa 1968 couch with a fire place nearby and have that lost art form of relaxation with you fellow guests. They are super animal friendly and provide complete services to your dog if you wish to bring it. The exercise room is great and there is a spa here as well.

The hotel is next to City Hall, where I had some business. We had a large quiet room, and used room service-the meal came quickly, and included a a bonus fruit cup. Enjoyed the pasta night (20 dollars for a three course meal) at the 312 restaurant-the starter and the dessert were wonderful, the main pasta a bit too salty.

Overall, it was a clean and interestingly decorated room and we were pleased. Others have complained about being able to clearly hear people in adjacent rooms but we must have lucked out in that way and did not experience that although we could occasionaly hear people talking in the hallway. One other reviewer complained rather bitterly about the area and said that it was dangerous and I can't even begin to understand that as we found it to be extremely safe.

I found the staff to be cordial, and I really like their corporate culture. They're pet-friendly (although I wasn't travelling with the dog), I got a recycling bin in my room, Aveda products in the bath and they don't clean with toxic chemicals. The rooms aren't huge and the bathrooms aren't what you're going to get at a Hilton. What the Allegro lacks in square footage it more than makes up for in cool. OK, they may be a little pricey, but I'm willing to pay a bit more considering the higher cost of doing business responsibily.",1,nan,ta_p35
trip_advisor,"We stayed in a king suite at the Hotel Allegro over Memorial Day weekend. We paid $130/night, and it was definitely a bargain. The suite was huge - living room with a couch, two chairs, desk; large bathroom; bedroom; two closets. The room had recently been renovated, and was very clean. Comfortable bed, friendly staff, great location (near the train and bus), evening wine reception and morning coffee provided. While the Allegro isn't a five-star hotel, it is a great place for the money. (Note: a friend stayed in a non-suite room, and reported that it was very small. Upgrade if possible).",1,nan,ta_p36
trip_advisor,Very friendly staff - and helpfull with whatever ? you may have. Don't miss the wine bar and the hot chocolate bar. Spacious rooms. Perfect for business and for theatre guests. A little quiet area during weekends.,1,nan,ta_p37
trip_advisor,"The Allegro in downtown Chicago is a great stay/ part of the Kimpton Group boutique hotels the Allegro offers a classy stay in a beautiful room for a moterate price/ they offer complimentary and decent wine gratis in the late afternoon and the hotel allows you access to everything the loop has to offer in this remarkable city. i would recommend parking outside of the downtown area and taking the 'EL' into the loop which leaves you about 2 minutes from the hotel/ otherwise you are looking at hefty parking fees for a car you dont need in this part of the city . the rooms are small but beautifully done with great colors,comfortable beds and in my case great views. if you go to kimpton group website and sign up for specials you will be alerted to great rates on certain days / kimpton does a great job and their properties are ""class acts""",1,nan,ta_p38
trip_advisor,"We booked this hotel for the second leg of our Chicago stay..it was great!!!! The Lion King package was pricey but reasonable, given the ticket costs and the Suite. Room was great....classical music greeted us when we entered our room after a long day of sightseeing and shopping. NYTimes and Chicago Tribune at your door every morning. One block from the Washington El train station. We never saw the small rooms that every one apparently doesn't like, but the Suite rooms were fun and our kids loved it. Dunkin Doughnuts and Corner Bakery down the block. City Hall, Picasso structure....this was a great place. Book it and also use the Golden Touch Limo service...reasonable. Omar is a super guy.",1,nan,ta_p39
trip_advisor,"This hotel cannot be beat for location, price, & atmosphere. The location is ideal, at the corner of State & Kinzie. There are fantastic restaurants & bars all around, including House of Blues & Harry Caray's. We stayed in a ""Corner King"" room. The room was amazing. Two of the four walls are floor to ceiling windows. Even just being on the 5th floor, we had great views of the surrounding area. The decor and amenities are unmatched. The decor is very clean & simple but luxurious. The hotel is easy to miss from street level, but shouldn't be. The staff were extremely friendly and accommodating. Its a perfect home base if your plans revolve around River North, State Street shopping, or Clark Street nightlife. Even if you'll be on the Mag Mile, this is a short cab ride away. We've officially named this our downtown hotel of choice!",1,nan,ta_p40
trip_advisor,"Stayed here for two days in the first week in January, when hotel was very quiet. Got a big corner room. Staff are friendly, decor is modern, and there's a huge choice of pastries and cakes and breads for breakfast, which you take back to your room. The free hors d'oevres with the drinks are great antipasti - olives, breads, cheeses and meats, marinated vegetables. This was a really easy hotel to stay in, fairly central - a couple of blocks away from the 'L', and quiet, despite the building work opposite. If you're in Chicago, stay here.",1,nan,ta_p41
trip_advisor,"We attended a Bachorette Party in Chicago in Aug 2005. There were 10 girls total. We had 5 rooms ... and I did not hear one complaint from anyone during our entire extended weekend. Never been to Chi-town before, I booked our hotel based on reviews from TA. And we were not disappointed. The staff is wonderful, the happy hour was just fabulous. The room was nice and clean, with a great double headed shower and Aveda products was an extra bonus! Then you also get free internet in your room! The hotel was chic and hip without the pretentiousness. We still talk about what a wonderful time we had ... and we all agree that if we ever go back to Chicago we will be staying at the Amalfi again. Trust me the pics don't do it justice!",1,nan,ta_p42
trip_advisor,"This small boutique hotel is tucked away in a perfect location between the Loop and the Miracle Mile. Two blocks west of the Wrigley Building and so convenient to restaurants, etc. The staff, from doormen to desk folks are extra nice and accommodating. The delicious breakfast on each floor is ultra-convenient, the evening happy hour is more than generous, and the morning paper is welcome. Bedding is so comfortable. This is our second stay, and certainly not our last. We love Chicago, and this hotel is one of the reasons why.",1,nan,ta_p43
trip_advisor,We arrived for a weekend stay and really enjoyed the hotel. The cocktail hour was so full of people that we could not get in. The second night we went earlier and it was very nice. The staff was very helpful and had a good knowledge of the area. The rooms were modern and very clean. We will stay there again.,1,nan,ta_p44
trip_advisor,"Just spent three nights at the Amalfi Hotel, while in Chicago on business. Booked a king-corner room and loved it. Largest room I've ever had in a hotel in Chicago, incredibly comfortable, very clean. The breakfast and evening cocktails were a nice bonus too. And the location couldn't be beat. Walking distance to the the River, the Loop, Michigan Ave shopping and convenient to public transportation. I noticed a number of reviews commented on the noise; yes there is some street noise, and the building across the street is under construction (the noise from that was usually between 730-4, if you want to sleep late during the week ask for a room on the back side) but really, in downtown Chicago it's not going to be silent, if you want silence stay in the suburbs. If you want a great hotel (at a great price) right in the thick of everything, stay at the Amalfi.",1,nan,ta_p45
trip_advisor,"What a wonderful experience, super great, helpful, friendly staff. Angie at the front desk made sure my husbands birthday would be great. Our room was beautiful. Angie suggested we go to Sullivans for dinner..perfect choice, make the reservation for us.(best seat in the house and a special dessert) wow...Above and beyond what any other hotel or staff has done for us before..Looking forward to staying there again & again. THANKS AGAIN",1,nan,ta_p46
trip_advisor,"This hotel was great - In a great area right downtown and close to everything. The daily happy hour had great food, wine and premium liquors. The free breakfast was even better! Actually I believe everything was included breakfast/happy hour/business center/WiFi. Our room was a king size facing the back of the building. Really clean new and comfortable. Small touches such as books and cds to enjoy made the room feel less like a hotel - Would highly recommend.",1,nan,ta_p47
trip_advisor,"This was our second time staying here. We were very much looking forward to our weekend at the Amalfi (based on how well the first stay was). It turned out better than our anticipation. The beds are very comfortable. 2 headed showers with a large bathroom. The hotel is also pleasantly quiet and easy to check-in and out. Our room was near the exercise room which helped motivate us to get in an hour morning workout. Then we were able to grab some complimentary fruit, pastries, juice and coffee on our floor (breakfast is on every floor). No great view from our room, but I don't think there are great views from most any room since it is only 5 floors. We didn't need to drive, take a cab or jump on the L the whole weekend since the hotel is centrally located. We easily walked to bars, blues clubs, restaurants, the hancock tower, the loop and the waterfront all from our hotel. The highlight of the hotel was the complimentary happy hour. Free top-shelf drinks and wonderful meats, cheeses, peppers, and breads. This ran from 5:30 to 7:00, and was a great warm-up to a nice dinner. This alone saved us a bundle in money that would of been spent eating and drinking out in the evening. And an extra money-saving tip...park at the self-park lot 2 blocks west of the hotel on Kinzie. Its $24 per night during the week and only $6 per night on the weekends. I think the hotel charges $30 to $40 per night to park.",1,nan,ta_p48
trip_advisor,"Review's a little late, but... My husband & I first stayed at the Amalfi in 8/06 totally based on reviews I read on this website. We were totally WOWED!! Loved the location, the room, the Aveda bath products, but most of all loved the evening reception & breakfast on our floor. I returned to Chicago with 3 girlfriends in 9/07 and booked us in a suite at the Amalfi. It was great - room was very spacious and my girlfriends were quite pleased! Will stay next time I'm in Chicago too!! P.S. They honor a government rate!!!!",1,nan,ta_p49
trip_advisor,"My wife and I just returned from a 3 night stay at the Amalfi Hotel in Chicago and enjoyed everything about the Hotel. Most importantly our room was perfect with plenty of space, great jazz CD's in the room, wonderful bathroom and one of the most comfortable beds I've ever slept in. The staff was very helpful with every request. The Amalfi offers a great continential breakfast on every floor each morning with good coffee and a great selection of pastry's, fruit's and jucie's. We also enjoyed the managers receptions one evening where they offer a great choice of complementary cocktails and antipasta's for their guests. Would highly recommend this hotel.",1,nan,ta_p50
trip_advisor,"I have stayed at the Amalfi Hotel before and it has always been excellent. This time was no different. Usually I book direct with the hotel, however, I found a slightly better deal booking through Expedia, which saved about $100. The staff were great. I arrived early and they had a room waiting. I was placed on the 6th (top) floor and it was quiet and comfortable. Overall, it was as good as it gets! I will definitely continue to stay here when I'm in Chicago. Remember, the hotel is close to everything - downtown, the Magnificent Mile, lots of restaurants, etc. Everything is within walking distance!",1,nan,ta_p51
trip_advisor,"This lovely hotel has only six floors, making it easy to get to elevators and down to reception. The building is dwarfed amongst all the skyscrapers around it. Trump's huge new tower is just down the street. The Amalfi looks recently refurbished, very modern, but warm and inviting. Bedrooms quite spacious with lovely linens and very, very comfortable beds. Bathroom quite small but roomy enough, with Aveda tolietries and constant hot water in the showers. Continental style breakfast is set out fresh every morning in front of the elevator of every floor. Great to stumble out of bed and grab a coffee etc (robes & slippers provided) without having to get dressed for a formal breakfast. Really enjoyed the Managers evening cocktail reception, especially the Amalfitinis. A nice way to relax after a hard days' shopping! Location is great for all the shops, transport, museums etc. Easy walking to everywhere. Staff also very friendly and welcoming. Would definately stay there again.",1,nan,ta_p52
trip_advisor,"This hotel was wonderful! I am a college student who went with my mom for the weekend and we both liked it! Pros: THE FRONT DESK and THE STAFF!!! -Helpful: Knew great places to eat and HOW to get there Breakfast: Pastries, coffee, tea, muffins, etc: Fresh Drinks + hors d'oeuvres: Yummy!! Rooms -Clean -Well decorated Lots of people of different ages stayed there Cons: Very very very far from the museums",1,nan,ta_p53
trip_advisor,"We stayed for just one night ,but the hotel staff was extremely friendly and polite. The rooms were clean and large. The decor had just been redone. The best perks were the complimentary continental breakfast on each floor in the morning and the free cocktail hour with premium drinks and great appetizers at night. We got a great rate and would go back. Great location for walking around.",1,nan,ta_p54
trip_advisor,"I decided to book at the Amalfi after cancelling a reservation for a different hotel after reading their reviews on TA. I was blown away by the reviews for the Amalfi on TA and decided to check it out. I was able to secure a great price on the hotel room and I was not disappointed. I asked to be put in a quiet room because I was having an interview the next day. The room was very quiet and in a great location, but my only complaint was that it was right next to the fitness center and I could hear people running on the treadmill during the day. However, it quieted down at night and I could not hear anything. The rooms were enormous for Chicago and I was pleased!!! The hotel provided free breakfast which was good, free internet, and free gym access. The hotel is only a few blocks from the Magnificient Mile and I walked there everyday to do shopping. I have to say that the doorman is truly a gem and is very friendly. I wish that their front desk staff were as friendly as he was. All in all, I plan to stay at the Amalfi anytime I visit Chicago in the future.",1,nan,ta_p55
trip_advisor,"I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone wanting accommodation in Chicago. Ideal position, lovely quiet rooms, good facilities, complimentary breakfast well received and the Manager's evening drinks reception excellent; we always tipped the staff who were serving our drinks. The in-house Amalfitini cocktail was very good. The staff were very friendly and helpful. If I ever return to Chicago I would certainly stay there again. Theres nothing bad I can say about this hotel.",1,nan,ta_p56

trip_advisor,"I already wrote a review about all the free stuff you get but now I'm going to write about the location! I like to walk. This place was close to EVERYTHING!!!! The 'Taste of Chicago' was on during the 4th of July. Let me tell you, this was the best 'taste' of a city that I have ever been to. It was massive and took 10 mins to walk there. I took the train in from the airport (it was around $2.00 but it was a solid 45 mins but for $2.00, how can you complain?)and it was approx a 10 walk to the hotel. We pretty much walked everywhere. We walked the entire magnificent mile strip. We went to the Blue Navy or whatever the docks are called. My favourite bar was 'Pops for Champagne.' Wow. I love champagne. And then of course there was the John Hancock Centre. And lots of shopping!",1,nan,ta_p58
trip_advisor,Well located and well staffed. The Amalfi was a clean and comfortable place to stay. It lacks a restaurant or bar but many are near by. Free continental breakfast and evening cocktail.,1,nan,ta_p59
trip_advisor,"My wife and I stayed at the Ambassador East Hotel for the first 3 days of our honeymoon in mid-October. We decided to split our honeymoon up and stay in two different hotels so that we could experience different aspects and areas of Chicago in a week. I'll start out by saying that this was a great experience. At check-in, I indicated that we were on our honeymoon and were upgraded to a suite. The Ambassador East is probably a 10 to 15 minute walk from the North end of the Magnificent Mile. It is also just a 2 or 3 minute walk to a lot of great restaurants and bars on Rush. Our room itself was incredibly spacious and well appointed. Our suite (on the 3rd floor) had two very large closets, a large ""living room"" and a large bedroom. The bed was incredibly comfortable and the bathroom was nice enough. If I would have payed full price for this suite, I probably would have given it a rating of 4, but because the staff was so kind and because my wife and I had such a great time here, I decided to give it a five. It is also worth mentioning that the concierge was very helpful. My wife and I decided to eat at The Pump Room restaurant, but we were not very impressed. We found the food and service mediocre. The atmosphere was probably pretty neat when Sinatra used to eat there back in the day, but not anymore. Although we were unimpressed by the Pump Room, the staff were kind enough to seat us in the ""Sinatra Booth"" which was back in a corner and enclosed by curtains. That neat experience was really the only redeeming value of our meal here. The Ambassador East is an older hotel, but it is in a charming older neighborhood. The staff's kindness and overall charm of the hotel itself really impressed my wife and me. When we are in Chicago again, we will definitely consider staying at the Ambassador East again.",1,nan,ta_p60
trip_advisor,"Our stay at the Ambassador East Hotel was extremely relaxing and pleasant. We enjoyed the location. We could easily walk to the Red line or access the bus lines along Michigan Avenue. We felt safe walking along the neighborhood streets and viewing the fabulous architecture that is on N. State Street and Dearborn. We walked to 3rd Coast Cafe, the Chicago History Museum, and Second City from our hotel. Our room was spacious and well-kept, and it was quiet enough for us to take a nap during the afternoon before heading out again in the evening. We would choose to stay there again even if we could afford more expensive locations downtown. We definitely enjoyed the neighborhood feel of the place.",1,nan,ta_p61
trip_advisor,"The Ambassador East is located in the Gold Coast neighborhood of Chicago. It is just a few blocks from the train station, so it was easy to get anywhere in town. The hotel is a National Historic Landmark so the lobby is elegant and beautiful. We loved the Pump Room bar with tons of B & W photos of celebrities. The service was wonderful and everyone was friendly and helpful.",1,nan,ta_p62
trip_advisor,"My stay at the Ambassador East was great! The hotel is in a great location in the charming Gold Coast neighborhood of downtown Chicago. Gave me the feeling of staying in a Chicago neighborhood vs. the concrete jungle of downtown, but the Magnificent Mile and Rush Street are just a few blocks from the front door. The staff was very friendly. Also, really enjoyed having drinks in the historic Pump Room. They had a live band on Saturday, and I really enjoyed looking at the pictures of the celebrities throughout the lounge that visited from years gone by. Definitely recommend it.",1,nan,ta_p63
trip_advisor,"Recently returned from a two-night stay at Ambassador East Hotel. Was looking for a comfortable hotel to stay at while visiting family now located in Chicago. Mission was accomplished. If you would like a quiet, comfortable hotel in a great area - this is it. While some of the furnishings show some signs of their age, it does not detract from the elegant style of the rooms and adds to the comfortable and home-like feeling. Found staff to be friendly and helpful. We will be return guests many times in the future for sure.",1,nan,ta_p64
trip_advisor,"The staff recognizes you by name with excellent eye contact. The ""welcome back"" sets the tone for your stay. Flowers in the lobby and reception area beautiful. The house-keeping staff is terrific, helpful and prompt. Room service food was served hot and that makes a big difference too. Pump Room food was surprising tasty and impressed my clients. Well done!",1,nan,ta_p65
trip_advisor,"We just returned from 4 nights at the Ambassador East. What a gem! The location in the Gold Coast neighborhood is perfect for finding restaurants and walking the Magnificent Mile. There is a train station about 2 blocks away. The room was very comfortable, with nice amenities, and there is free Internet service on the 2nd floor. Best of all was the bell and lobby staff! They really went out of their way to be helpful and greeted us warmly each time we left and arrived. I would say that this was the nicest hotel staff I've encountered in all my travels.",1,nan,ta_p66
trip_advisor,We live down the block from the hotel. We arranged to have new floors put in our condo while we were away. The floors were not finished when we returned so we looked for an inexpensive local hotel for one night. I think the Ambassador East was the least expensive hotel within a reasonable distance so we decided to stay there. Over the years I had had some visiting groups stay there. I had also eaten there and been to the bar but I had never stayed there myself. The lobby is elegant. The service is great and the room was large and clean although a little outdated. The location is the best residential area in the city (as far as I am concerned -- I live two blocks away) and it is very convenient to North Michigan Avenue ( a good shopping street) and reasonably convenient to the Loop ( the main business area) There are also probably 50 restaurants in all price ranges in reasonable walking distance including some of the best in the city. I paid less than $100 including tax for one night. I am not sure what their regular rates are but I think my deal was the best travel bargain around.,1,nan,ta_p67
trip_advisor,"Be prepared the hotel is old. It is on the historic list. The is updating to be done no doubt.. So just be forewarned. It is clean and the staff is phenomenal. Having said that, you can not beat the location. Right in the heart of the Gold coast. Take a train from O'hare right into the city. It drops you off only 4 blocks from the hotel. One block from the beach and public transportation is right there. Incredible area to explore. I highly recommend the Ambassador East",1,nan,ta_p68
trip_advisor,"I love the Ambassador East, true, she's a little old but she's a classic treasure. The service is wonderful, from the minute you arrive you are greeted warmly and with a nice welcome! I felt the service was good, room was clean and quiet and that all the staff was very accomodating. The biggest gem is the Pump Room bar and restaurant. The best drinks, amazing food, exciting photographs and fun music on the weekends. This is set in the most fabulous location; historical neightborhood, close to walk the lakefront, well known hometown bars, excellent restaurants Chicago has to offer and most of all shopping. There was a nice street market going on over the summer-fall weekends, giving this area a real interesting flavor of Chicago. I can see it needs some updating but I was totally happy and content with my stay. I travel a great deal in my work and have seen all kinds of hotels. I will stay here again in the future.",1,nan,ta_p69
trip_advisor,"WOW!! Where do I start? Booked this hotel through Hotels.com for less than I paid for the Travellodge Downtown. Check in was a breeze, the entire staff was friendly and helpful. Our room was huge. The king bed was very comfortable. Our room also had 2 nightstands, 2 chairs with a small table, a desk, and walk-in closet. Even with all the furniture, the room was very spacious. The room did show some signs of wear, but I think this adds to the charm and the rich history of this hotel. The hotel is located in a neighborhood, so it felt like we were staying in a condo or a home rather than a hotel. There is very little noise, however, you are only about 2 blocks from Rush and Division streets, with all the nightlife, and the Red Line at Clark and Division is only 3 blocks away. We decided to walk to Michigan Ave and the next thing we knew, we were at the Hancock building. By staying here, you are away from the noise, but not away from the action. Had breakfast at the Pump Room, which is a story in itself. We had our photo taken in booth 1. Take some time and research who has sat in this booth. It is impressive. Some 1400 photos of celebrity guests adorn the walls of the Pump Room. Didn't have a chance to have dinner here, but I will return for dinner someday. Breakfast was not anything fancy, and a bit pricy, but the history and experience was worth it in my opinion. The waitstaff was friendly as was everyone who worked at this hotel was. I can't wait to return here!",1,nan,ta_p70
trip_advisor,"In a very nice location close to shopping and places to eat and also in a beautiful neighborhood. A small hotel with a pleasant place to sit in the lobby, the Pump Room is a classic place to have a drink. We did not have dinner there so I can not comment but we enjoyed people watching while we had an afternoon drink looking out the window at the people in the neighborhood. It is a short walk to very good shopping and eating.",1,nan,ta_p71
trip_advisor,"We also just returned from a frigid weekend in Chicago. I booked the Ambassador East because of its great rate, $89.00 with my AAA card and we were delighted. Yes, the rooms show some signs of wear, but the warmth and charm far make up for it. This was such a pleasant change from the sleek, modern look of many other chain and boutique hotels. We became members of the I preferred program and were therefore eligible for an upgrade which we automatically got upon check in. We had a lovely suite with lots of sitting room and a comfortable bedroom and bathroom. We had wonderful food at the Pump Room which is classic. Our oatmeal there was so tastefully served, I'd love to have some right now! The location was great. Had it been normal winter weather, we could have easily walked to Michigan Avenue for shopping, but due to the minus 20 degree windchills, we opted for a cab which was less than a $5.00 fare. We also enjoyed a glass of wine around the fireplace in the lobby and found it so welcoming and cozy and not overcrowed at all. We would definitely stay here again!",1,nan,ta_p72
trip_advisor,"I loved the Ambassador! What a great hotel. It's really beautiful, and the room was absolutely striking, very classic and elegant. Everything was done really well: the staff treated me like a regular. This is a top-notch hotel, the best place I've stayed in a long time. My only complaint is that I wish it was on the Mile, but that's it.",1,nan,ta_p73

trip_advisor,"Just returned from 2 nights at the Ambassador and I have to say that I am very happy that I chose this hotel. It is true that this is an older hotel. But it is well kept and it does not lack in style and grandeur. (think of the hotel from the Shining, minus the elevator of blood and creepy twins.) From the check-in desk to the surprise turn down service from the maids, I was made to feel like royalty. A special acknowledgment goes out to the doormen who helped me with all my tourist questions. Also the location of the hotel is great. Close to all the action, but on a quite residential street with beautiful old mansions. I also got a sweet $89 per night room by booking on travelzoo. That was just an added bonus however. Even if I paid $200 per night, my impression of the Ambassador would not change. Highly, highly recommended.",1,nan,ta_p75
trip_advisor,"Ambassador East is an awesome hotel!!! Understand that this hotel is full of history and is a boutique hotel. My family stayed at the Ambassador for two nights in a suite. Very clean room with great space. The best part of the Ambassador is not the rooms though. The staff was extremely courteous, especially the concierge. If you stay here you have to go to the Pump Room. The restaurant is full of nostalgia, the staff is great, and the food is excellent. Great atmosphere and music.",1,nan,ta_p76
trip_advisor,"Upon check in - the lobby was BUSY! I was tired and not feeling well from a tough road show. The Front Desk person I checked in with was so fast and so nice that I walked away from the desk smiling... that alone was such a great feeling. Every time I had any experience with a hotel staff member, I was so pleased! I have to say - service really is everything to me and I have to give this top marks for that. An added bonus was the location... I just think it is perfect for me. On top of that, I had a meeting down in the loop, but not quite sure how to get there - a person approached me in the lobby, asked if he could help me get to my meeting. I thought he was getting me a taxi - but no - he walked me to his SUV and drove me to the meeting, ""just a free service from the hotel"" he stated as we drove... really!!!! so cool! I haven't even talked about the Pump Room yet - great dinner, very professional service, and no attitude. I will return - just up date the rooms a little bit, thats all... the curtains need some help.",1,nan,ta_p77
trip_advisor,"Booked a room online and got a great rate under $200 which is very cheap for a summer hotel room in Chicago in this nice location, 3 blocks I think from the water. Even though our rate was so cheap, the service was wonderful, the front desk were polite& cheerful, the doormen and valet were great and helpful, and they even put a fridge in our room when we requested on, free of charge! The fitness room was clean, large and provided fruit and clean towels, and it had the greatest view of the city as it was on the top floor of the hotel. Location of hotel is safe, and such a beautiful area. Check the rates directly online of the hotel's website, as it was the least expensive. We will stay here again for sure.",1,nan,ta_p78
trip_advisor,"We stayed at the AE for two nights for a three generation ""girls weekend"" (Grandma, mom and daughter). I looked at their website for an idea of rates and looked at any packages that might interest us. Then I called the property directly and was assisted by a very gracious man named Reece. Rates were a bit high for the Saturday night portion of our stay but when I requested the American Girl Package, he was more than happy to honor the advertised rate. The American Girl package was perfect for us. My 8 year old daughter was thrilled. They give you a doll bed, a backpack and a travel kit to keep. They have matching bathrobes for girl and doll (you don't get to keep those). She also got a special welcome letter and a complimentary room service snack from a specially printed menu. Our room, 1334, was large and clean. It had two double beds with nice linens, two chairs, a desk and a clean bathroom. The employees are all very friendly and helpful. We had a drink in the Pump Room but did not eat there. We ate breakfast nearby at a great place called the 3rd Coast. This hotel is north of Michigan Ave. But it is just a short, pleasant walk to the Mag. Mile. I would definately stay here again in Chicago.",1,nan,ta_p79
trip_advisor,"I just left the Conrad Chicago and have nothing but good things to say. We used Hilton points to stay there but paid $35/night to upgrade to a junior suite. We were in room 1519. I would reccomend people ask for an odd numbered room so that they will have a view looking north on Michigan Ave. Our room was very modern with 2 large HD/flat panel tv and Bose 3 speaker sound system. 4 big windows that actually open. The bed lineds were very nice, the towels were OK. The room was clean and the bath room had a seperate shower and tub. Marble everywhere. Robes, slippers, etc. The work out room was good with different machines and some free weights. There are clean towels in the workout room too. We never ate in the hotel so I can't comment on the food or the prices. There is a Starbucks across the street (Michigan) and an Espresso bar attached to the Nordstrom that is on the ground floor of the hotel. It was very nice to have the little mall right under the hotel. The location of the hotel could not be better. We were walking distance to everything. Every kind of shopping or dinning experience you could possibly want was within 2 miles. Over all the hotel had a boutique feel to it even though it is part of the hilton chain.",1,nan,ta_p80
trip_advisor,"My wife and I came to spend the weekend in downtown Chicago for shopping and we found this Conrad hotel well located close to everything downtown and of a size that doesn't make you feel lost in the Convention world. We have had this feeling when staying at larger hotels in the past. Our Suite has view on Michigan avenue with a bit of the Lake at the end. Staff was very professional, pleasant and friendly making us feel very comfortable. Internet is free n the rooms and I am making my review from there.",1,nan,ta_p81
trip_advisor,"We have just returned from 4 nights at the Conrad Chicago, everthing about the hotel was excellent. Wonderful room and service from all the staff was first class. Great view from our room. The hotels location is great, right in the centre of the magnificent mile. A wonderful stay in an amazing city was made perfect by our stay at the Conrad.",1,nan,ta_p82
trip_advisor,"We spent a week in this hotel and were very pleased with the experience. As described in previous reviews. the room was very comfortable with the huge televison and bathroom being particularly outstanding. Service was excellent overall (I especially liked the bottle of water at my bedside with the turn down service). The door and bellmen/women were particularly pleasant and helpful and the concierge was friendly and knowledgeable. We had completely satisfactory (though overpriced) drinks in the bar but didn't eat at the restaurant. The health club was fine and the equipment was well maintained. While there were only three treadmills and two elipitical steppers, I never had to wait for a machine although it might be a different story in the dead of a Chicago winter! One minor quibble--I like to have coffee first thing in the morning and there was no in-room coffee maker. The restaurant offered free coffee ""to-go"" but only before eight AM. This is a very, very comfortable, attractive hotel in a wonderful location. Chicago is an expensive city but we felt that we got a reasonable value for our money.",1,nan,ta_p83
trip_advisor,"Arrived on 06/04/05, greeted by friendly doorman, and zipped up to the 5th Floor Lobby. Very open lobby area with friendly reception staff. Room was on the 12th Floor and very nice. Everything was in order and very clean! The king size bed was nice and each night I had a restful sleep. Bathroom was large with separate glass shower stall. The room was furnished with everything I needed including internet hook-up access. Also, you can walk thru on the 5th Fl to the Westfield North Bridge Shopping Mall, where you will enjoy Nordstrom and other stores. Of course, you're steps from Michigan Ave. too. The central location of the hotel was great, as I could walk to most places. The CTA Subway stop (Grand Ave. on Red Line) was an easy 2 block walk. I will stay here again on my next trip to Chicago!",1,nan,ta_p84
trip_advisor,"My husband and I decided to take a trip to Chicago at the last minute and quickly chose the Conrad, not really knowing it's location. We were pleasantly surprised to find it was almost right on Michigan Ave. (It's connect to Nordstroms right in the heart of downtown. ) Great for shopping. The hotel itself was fabulous. The staff was extremely helpful in giving suggestions for shows and restaurants. I recommend going to Joe's that's right across the street from the hotel. Everyone was raving about it . . .but we couldn't get a reservation. The room was wonderful and the bed and pillows were very comfortable. It had a very warm and inviting atmosphere. My husband loved the workout room. I highly recommend the Conrad!!",1,nan,ta_p85
trip_advisor,"Ok, so first trip to chicago and I was a litlle worried about the hotel and the location, finally I decided on the CONRAD and wath a good experience i had, I booked a king deluxe room on the 6th floor, view was not amazing but that was the only coplaint i could had, room is nice, bath was all appliances and good size, good plasma tv, free internet, we asked one day for breaksfast and amazing food! so overall and for the price aroufn 220 It was a great surprise, the locating was very good a few blocks from everything and very quiet hotel",1,nan,ta_p86
trip_advisor,"We stayed at the Conrad for 2 nights for a friends reunion. The room was clean and new feeling, nice city view, free bottled water in room upon arrival. Check in was a breeze, and our room was ready even though we were several hours early. All staff was friendly and helpful, excellent breakfast.",1,nan,ta_p87
trip_advisor,"We stayed for a one night getaway with family on a thursday. Triple AAA rate of 173 was a steal. 7th floor room complete with 44in plasma TV bose stereo, voss and evian water, and gorgeous bathroom(no tub but was fine for us) Concierge was very helpful. You cannot beat this location... Only flaw was breakfast was pricey and service was very very slow(2hours for four kids and four adults on a friday morning) even though there were only two other tables in the restaurant. Food was very good so it was worth the wait. I would return in a heartbeat. A gem in chicago...",1,nan,ta_p88
trip_advisor,"We stayed at the Conrad for only one evening but it was such an amazing room we would have liked to stay longer! We were on the newly renovated 9th floor and the room was gorgeous and super clean! There was a flat screen, bose sound system and even an Ihome for our Ipod. Wireless was free and they bring you a free bottle of water at turn down. Everyone was very helpful and so friendly. We can't wait to go back again!",1,nan,ta_p89
trip_advisor,"We usually stay at the Sofitel but thought we would try the Conrad for a change. I don't think I would rate this hotel over the Sofitel but it was still 1st class. But I do think the service was better at the Conrad. We arrived at the hotel just before the restaurant closed and soon we were the only table left. Normally service goes down hill then but our waiter Eric was the best. Even when I kept ordering my after dinner ports. The meal may not have been The Chop House but it was still very good. The bar was ok, no Crown Reserve. They did have the Cask 16 at $24 a drink, ouch. The room service was very quick. Our room was very clean and the maids replace everything including the ashtrays during their visits. The only fault we could find was the temperature on the 14th floor. It was so hot that we had our window open the whole time with the heat turned completely off. Which wasn't so bad since my wife smokes. The temp on the 5th where the lobby, bar, and restaurant was fine. We enjoyed the hotel enough that we will be back in Sept. One last thing, if you like a cheap fantastic breakfast. Go to the West Egg, only a few blocks away.",1,nan,ta_p90
trip_advisor,"My husband and I stayed here for New Years eve weekend. This is an excellent hotel in an excellent location. Hotel is very tastefully decorated and warmly welcoming. The rooms had the best electronics I've ever seen. Loved that they had a soaking tub and a spacious shower stall. The hotel restaurant seemed to be empty everytime we walked by, so we avoided it too. Ate at Joe's across the street - excellent seafood. And you can shop til you drop without going outside! Nordstroms and four story mall is attached. Lots of good ""food on the run"" places in there. Loved Chicago - loved the Conrad. I will go back!",1,nan,ta_p91
trip_advisor,"My boyfriend and I decided to stay at the Conrad Chicago for our anniversary. The second we walked in, we were immediately won over by the look and feel of the room. White luxurous bedding on the King bed, plasma t.v./ subroofer/ surround sound speakers (my boyfriend was more impressed than me, as I reminded him that we didn't come to Chicago for the hotel room) very large bathroom w/ tub and separate stand-in shower, granite countertops, his/ her robes and slippers. The view wasn't great, but we were on the 6th floor and not really high enough to see anything but the side of the building next to us. Not a large room by any means, but again . . . we didn't go to the city for the hotel room. It was the prefect size for the amount of time we were actually in the room. We got a great rate on it ($140 at hotels.com) but I think the going rate is usually closer to mid $200's. I've stayed in quite a few hotels in the downtown area and none have ever impressed me more than this one. We will definitely be staying there again on our next trip into the city.",1,nan,ta_p92
trip_advisor,"This was a weekend trip for my friends and I. We booked a couple of rooms and asked in advanced for the reservations to be connected in some way. Our rooms were right next to one another as requested. As it was almost everyone's first time to Chicago, we had to do a bit of cold-searching for a hotel. And, our choice was next to perfect. I had an amazing time during my first visit to Chicago and it was largely due to this hotel. The customer service was AMAZING. Everyone was extremely nice and helpful. One of our rooms ordered late night room service and raved about how they felt they had ordered a 5 star lunch because it was as fresh as having ordered food at 2 pm, and delicious. My friend suggested they had a full-staff at 3 am because the food came up quickly too. In another of our rooms, housekeeping had accidentally discarded a CD when replacing the CD player with an iPod dock. The concierge had the exact CD purchased and ready at check-out from the neighboring record store. Our rate included complimentary breakfast which was fantastic! Everything was freshly made in their kitchen too. An added bonus was that the hotel is attached to a mall. Therefore, you don't need to leave the building to get a pair of shoes, a coffee, or a some other type of trinket. I was beyond pleased with this hotel and would stay here again without hesitation.",1,nan,ta_p93
trip_advisor,"The Conrad Hotel is a beautiful hotel. Our room was perfect and beautiful in every way. I was very impressed (and I am hard to please and have high standards). It was so clean, aesthetically pleasing, up to date, just gorgeous! I would definitely stay there again. I loved it. The location is superb too, attached to Nordstrom and Northbridge mall. Can't wait to go back!",1,nan,ta_p94
trip_advisor,"I travelled to Chicago last week with my daughter for some Christmas shopping. We booked the Conrad based on the reviews on Tripadvisor. It lived up to all expectations. Great big room, with two king size beds. Very comfortable. Breakfast was great, loads of choice and plenty on the plate. Great location, connected to a shopping mall which was very useful the day it snowed. All and all, a great hotel and we would go back in the morning. Chicago is a great city with very friendly people.",1,nan,ta_p95
trip_advisor,"My wife and I stayed here in the middle of February 2005. We took the (EL) subway to the hotel from O'Hare. It was very convenient. The lobby was nice and the room was clean and comfortable. I've stayed in many a hotel room, this bed was the most comfortable I've ever slept in. The hotel is located in a great area and close to everything. Walking distance to almost all the interesting sites Chicago has. Would definetly recommend this hotel to anyone visiting this great city.",1,nan,ta_p96
trip_advisor,"We stayed in the Conrad for 4 nights just before Thanksgiving. We had a corner room overlooking N Michigan Av and the Tribune Building. To say this is a 5 star hotel is to damn this place with faint praise - it is wonderful. The staff were unbelievably helpful. The standard of the room was superb - HD plasma screens, luxury bedlinens, iPod radio, huge bathroom. Location is unbeatable - right in the heart of everything - watched the whole Light Festival parade from the window. Breakfasts were excellent - no help yourself buffet here - with full and attentive table service. Would have no hesitation recommending or staying again in this hotel - 5 out of 5.",1,nan,ta_p97
trip_advisor,This is my second time here in two months; both stays were great. The rooms are very nice and very clean. The staff is terrific and always attentive. My only concern would be there never seems to be anyone at the concierge desk.,1,nan,ta_p98
trip_advisor,"This is a superb hotel. The rooms are huge, including a luxurious bathroom. It is clean and service is first rate. Breakfast was excellent (and complimentary for Hilton Honors members). Hotel is in a good location, and is connected to a mall, which I imagine would be a great asset in the Chicago winter. Next time I go to Chicago, I will stay here for sure.",1,nan,ta_p99
trip_advisor,"We got a great deal on this hotel, just $91 found through travelzoo. We only stayed one night, but were very impressed. The sevice was fantastic from the moment we stepped up to the property. The hotel smelled wonderful and was immaculate. Our room, while not enormous was perfect. We had a great view of the city and lake. The bed was extremely comfortable. We never heard any noise outside of our room. The bathroom was nice sized considering we must have had one of the smaller rooms in the hotel, two could get ready very comfortably. Location was perfect, just off Michigan Ave and steps away from Millenium Park. We would definetly stay here again, especially if we could get this great deal!",1,nan,ta_p100
trip_advisor,Great location and quality place to stay. Lovely large clean room with a queen size bed it was great. Staff were very helpful and put us onto some great restaurants and then some music bars. Coleman on the front desk was a great guy to meet as a first impression he sold the hotel to us with his personality. The hotel delivered an anniversary cake to us in our room (compliments of the hotel) for me this showed that they care about their guests Many thanks to all it was a great place to stay.,1,nan,ta_p101
trip_advisor,"The reviews we read were a bit mixed, but I thought it was excellent. I've stayed in The Splendido, Villa D'Este and others and it doesn't compare, but nor should it. It doesn't claim to be in that space. I expected it to be a notch off the Four Seasons and so it proved. A only a small notch too!. Lovely clean and bright room. Superb views, very quiet, comfy bed etc. Excellent service all round and nice staff. For the money and quality it stacked up very well indeed. Couldn't really fault it any way given it was half the cost of the Four Seasons but pretty close in terms of overall experience. We will go there again when in Chicago. Great location too.",1,nan,ta_p102
trip_advisor,"I vacationed at the Fairmont Chicago for 3 nights in July 2009. The room, the bathroom, the view, and the staff were all wonderful. I just wish the hotel were a few blocks North (on MI Ave). Sometimes, when you're tired, that extra couple of blocks seem like miles!",1,nan,ta_p103
trip_advisor,"For the price of the Marriott we spent a night here ($122 + tax) and had an enjoyable if brief stay. As others have noted the hotel has been recently renovated, and the rooms are furnished with attractive and sleek scandanavian-type design. The staff was polite and attentive, and seemed to match the redesign with a hip kind of feel. The parking is pricey at $49, so I used an adjacent lot and self-parked, and as others have noted, the lack of water-pressue in the shower was disappointing. Good location. Would return, esp as this pricepoint.",1,nan,ta_p104
trip_advisor,"I recently stayed at the Fairmont Chicago and found it to be a fantastic hotel. Staff was always courteous and helpful - from the front desk staff at check-in to wait staff in Aria restaurant, to the maid who cleaned my room. The rooms were recently updated, with large flat-screen TV's, beautiful linens, and exceptional toiletries in each room. My room even had a view of Monroe St. harbor. It is truly a first-rate hotel. Location is south of the river and east of Michigan Ave -- as we normally stay north of the river it seems a little out of the way (if that's possible in downtown Chicago), however its location significantly lowers street noise. The hotel has excellent access to Millennium Park, the Aon center (there is a connecting concourse), and is about 4 blocks from shopping on North Michigan Ave. I ate dinner in Aria and it was fantastic! Room service for breakfast was quite good as well. Overall, I'd stay again in a minute if I had business in the loop, or leisure plans in Millennium or Grant Parks.",1,nan,ta_p105
trip_advisor,"I stayed at the Fairmont to attend a conference. I was very pleased with the hotel. The doorman offered me an umbrella as I headed out for a walk... and sure enough it started to rain very soon after- I would have been soaked with it. Upon my return, the doorman then asked about my walk, etc. This is reflective of all the staff I encountered. The front desk promptly checked me in. DEFINITELY register for their rewards program before you arrive... The complimentary gym access is excellent, plus you save on internet access fees which are waived for members. The bathroom and separate dressing areas were large and convenient. The only negative- no coffee maker! AND the Starbucks in the adjacent building is closed on weekends since the area corporate offices are closed those days!!! Otherwise my stay was perfect, considering the conference rate was $99 per night!",1,nan,ta_p106
trip_advisor,"We went to Chicago to see an exhibit at the Art Institute and selected the Fairmont because it was so close. Although the lobby is still being renovated, our experience at the hotel was uniformly positive. The room was nicely sized and newly remodeled and immaculate. The only glitch involved getting the room coffee replenished. The maid does not do that, and by bedtime on the first night, we still didn't have coffee. We called the front desk and they immediately delivered a fresh supply. The restaurant is a little underwhelming, but with so many other places to go within a very few blocks, we probably wouldn't have eaten there any more than we did. After having stayed in close to a dozen different Chicago hotels, this may be the hotel we return to whenever we return.",1,nan,ta_p107
trip_advisor,"From the moment I stepped up to the front entrance my luxury service began! I enjoyed every minute @ the fairmont! The King room was spacious and the decor chic! The coffee maker was the coolest and the bathroom is huge! I really like the separate shower, tub, and separate door for the toilet. The desserts and cheese spread at ENO so yummy. Before the fairmont the W hotel was my favorite chain of hotels to stay at.",1,nan,ta_p108
trip_advisor,"My husband and I were in the Fairmont Chicago recently for a conference. We stayed in a spacious suite. All amenities appeared recently updated and in excellent shape. The bed was very comfortable. Views were great. I love their products in the bathroom and used them in the pristine tub two out of three nights. The room was so quiet, it was very relaxing. We ate in the restaurant downstairs (Aria) and although pricey, it was excellent. The staff were consistently attentive and responsive. It is evident that everyone is very well-trained. I would love to stay here again.",1,nan,ta_p109
trip_advisor,"Simply a nice place to stay... I had a great deal for the room, and was impressed with the quality. Hotel staff was very helpful; they were able to let me check out and helped me print boarding passes. Negative: It is frustrating that nowadays you do not have free internet in most hotels and it's the same here; you have to pay for the internet. Negative: Loud on the phone you may hear your neighbors on the phone, or them shower.",1,nan,ta_p110
trip_advisor,"I stayed at the Fairmont Chicago for one night - I'm a frequent business traveler and am very familiar with travel rituals. I checked in late (almost 10pm) due to flight cancellations from my home airport -- Atlanta. I took the shuttle to the airport (best option in lieu of the over priced taxis), and it was my first time staying at the hotel. Upon arrival, I immediately noticed the entrance, which appeared very welcoming and warm to me. I checked in with no problems -- and the desk person even asked if I'd prefer a king or double (reconfirming my reservation preference). I always take the king when I can, and the bed was fantastic! It was suited with great linen and these incredible down & feather pillows named Encompass made by The Pillow Factory -- I checked the tags, since I plan to buy some! I ate dinner at the hotel restaurant - Aria, which they mention they like to be considered separate from the hotel -- and YES, it does stand out all on it's own. The food is Asian fusion, and truly wonderful -- as a gourmand and life-long foodie, I appreciate great food when I taste it! The hotel service was good as well. Only drawback was the breakfast buffet at the restaurant -- seems they need to stick with their dinner theme solely. They missed the mark on relatively simply things like scrambled eggs on the buffet, which tasted a bit 'metallic'. But they made up for it by getting a special order made immediately after I passed on the buffet. I would highly recommend this hotel -- it has atmosphere and a great view (if you can get a room with one), fabulous dinner -- just pass on the breakfast buffet.",1,nan,ta_p111
trip_advisor,We got this hotel by chance since we decided the spur of the moment to spend a nite in Chicago on 7/24/09. We went thru Priceline and was lucky to get a room at this hotel for only $69 (normal rate was around $200). The room was superb on the 29th floor with a nice king bed. Hotel is only about 1.5 blocks to Michigan Ave so the location is very convenient. Parking is very expensive at $50 a nite but we parked right next door at a selfpark for just $30. We decided to have breakfast at the hotel restaurant to save us from walking elsewhere. We ordered the buckwheat pan cakes and egg benedict. They were absolutely delicious which stunned us since we didn't expect this type of experience from a hotel restaurant especially for breakfast. Glad we didn't pick their breakfast buffet since the special menu is much better. I highly recommend this beautiful and cozy hotel for your Chicago visit.,1,nan,ta_p112
trip_advisor,"I stayed at the Fairmont during a professional conference. While I have to say that for a conference, some of the meeting rooms were too small, in terms of traveler's comfort the hotel is exceptional! I can't think of a single thing about my room that wasn't perfect. The accommodations were luxurious and the hotel is conveniently situated within walking distance of many Chicago attractions.",1,nan,ta_p113
trip_advisor,"Nestled just off the beaten path and about two blocks from the river the Fairmont Chicago offers an excellent location to operate as home base for your trip to Chicago. The staff were friendly and helpful, arranging many of the sightseeing events we enjoyed while in the city. There are many attractions withiin easy walking distance (The Art Institute is a must see and Millenium Park is a fun visit). The architectural tour by river departs a dock that is very close to the Fairmont and there are lots of restaurants nearby. The rooms were excellent and the club room is worth the extra expense. We would definitely stay here again.",1,nan,ta_p114
trip_advisor,"We recently completed our second stay at the Fairmont Chicago. The check-in process was quick and painless but the front desk staff was almost disinterested in the whole procedure. That is fine when I am traveling on business, but on leisure trips I would appreciate a warmer greeting. The hotel was hosting a convention at the same time as our stay, but other than seeing some signage/attendees in the lobby, we wouldn't have noticed. This is probably due to the separation of the conference areas from the guest rooms and the 8 speedy elevators. We stayed in a Parkview Suite so we had a large room with a great view of Millenium Park. The anteroom was well appointed with a sofa, coffee table, desk, mini-bar with sink and coffee maker, and dining area. The bedroom appeared to be the same as a standard Fairmont room, but maybe slightly larger. The bathroom also appeared to be similar to a standard Fairmont room, and once again, possibly slightly larger. The upscale modern decor is pleasing but not overtly luxurious, and several small touches such as a shoe shine station (with extra collar tabs), are peppered throughout. We booked a few evening activities through the concierge and everything was perfectly handled. The hotel restaurant, Aria, couldn't find our reservation but they oddly new my name and remembered that the hotel had called to make a reservation for us. They had no problem seating us and the dinner (both food and service) was lovely. Minor complaints: The pillows could be better. I'm not sure if they remembered our preference for non-down bedding from our last visit, but seriously, these things barely felt like pillows. I'll suffer through some congestion if I can get better neck support. Also, the valet parking attendants seem overly eager to take your car (and charge you $49). And as I mentioned above, the front desk experience could be improved. Best feature: After our first stay, I gave a brief review in the comments section of the Fairmont President's Club (membership is free) website. I received a phone call from the Director of Rooms the same day asking to discuss our experience. After this stay, I left a comment essentially thanking the hotel staff for a great stay, but still received a warm, friendly phone call from the Director of Rooms asking if he could do anything to improve our next stay. Kudos to the Fairmont for taking its customers seriously, and for that, they've won my loyalty.",1,nan,ta_p115
trip_advisor,"I actually booked this reservation with the hotel over the phone and got a great rate -- much lower than the usual price! It was a lovely hotel, beautifully appointed, walking distance from the places we wanted to go. We would highly recommend the Fairmont.",1,nan,ta_p116
trip_advisor,"We stayed at the Fairmont two nights for the SOFA art fair at the Navy Pier. I was impressed that the bellman called us by name when he met the taxi and pronounced it correctly, which is quite unusual. Everyone smiled and welcomed us. The lobby looks clean and friendly, not ultramodern, but not at all tired or worn. Our room, also clean and comfortably furnished, was larger than we expected, with a clean, modern bath and a lovely view of the Navy Pier and the lake. We did not eat at the restaurant, but it looked attractive. Our only problem was that we had asked for non-feather pillows, upon reserving the room, upon checking in, and calling housekeeping. After waiting an hour, we went to bed. The next day the check-in desk person was extremely apologetic and by the time we returned, all the feathers were replaced with foam and non-allergenic materials. The hotel is convenient to Millenium Park and Michigan Ave. We would stay there again, assuming we could get good rates.",1,nan,ta_p117
trip_advisor,"The concierge was so helpful. Without hesitation they had the best recommendations for restaurants and attractions all turning out to be wonderful. They even gave us business cards for restaurants that did not take reservations so we could obtain preferential or immediate seating's. Loved the health club at the back of the hotel. By joining the presidents club, it only cost ten dollars a day to use the facilities. The rooms were large, updated and had views looking out in 3 directions. The coffee maker in the room was exceptional. Location is great for getting mostly anywhere. Parking is overpriced so we took our cart to the underground Millennium Garage that was only $25.00 per 24 hours and a few blocks walk from the hotel.",1,nan,ta_p118
trip_advisor,I stayed at the Fairmont for a few nights and found the whole experience excellent. I was given a very large room with great views of the city; the breakfast was extremely good; and the location was as central as I could have wished for. The pool was not large but felt luxurious and was great for early morning swims. In the evening I spent some time in the hotel bar with friends and that was excellent too. Highly recommended as a base for exploring Chicago.,1,nan,ta_p119
trip_advisor,"We booked 2 rooms for 2 nights on Hotwire over Labor Day weekend. We arrived at the Hard Rock at around 10:00 a.m., and they were able to give us our rooms early. Hooray! We were on the 5th floor (Beatles theme). The rooms were very comfortable. One of our rooms was on a corner, and had lots of windows. The other was was a bit larger with fewer windows. Not a great view from our side of the hotel, but we didn't pay for a room with a view. The beds and pillows were EXTREMELY comfortable, the bathroom was full of Aveda products, and there was a bathrobe in the closet. The tv/dvd/stereo combo was nice, but we weren't in the room a lot to use it. We were warned by the front desk not to even touch the snacks/drinks as they were weighted and we'd be charged. No problems there. We did not make use of the free fitness center, because the weather was perfect. My husband was able to go for a run through Grant Park along the waterfront instead. He said it was wonderful. We did use the free internet in our rooms. It was 'wired' internet, but my stepdad said that was better for him anyway. The room was a bit dim at night, but we were able to read just fine using the bedside lamps. There was virtually no hall / elevator noise. The location of the Hard Rock is ideal. It is easy to get breakfast at the Corner Bakery, just blocks to either Grant Park, The Art Institute, State Street Shopping, or Michigan Ave. To sum up, there was absolutely NOTHING to complain about. We would be glad to stay here again any time.",1,nan,ta_p120
trip_advisor,"Got a great deal through Hotwire for $70 a night but if I ever return to Chicago I would definitely stay again, even at full price. We really liked the rooms muted modern decor, we had John Lennon and Bono for company. Comfortable bed, mini coffe maker, plenty storage space and a lovely, clean bathroom stocked full of Aveda products (so I was sold straight away...it doesn't take much, I know!). If you're a product junkie, tip the maid and request some extra bottles and you will leave with lots of goodies :) We liked the location and had a great view down N Michigan Ave, found the staff to be really friendly and relaxed (reception, gift shop and bar). The bar area is very trendy, I liked the chilled atmosphere which surprised me cause I normally find these types of bars a bit too pretentious for my liking...the lack of memorabilia didn't bother me but I was more interested in the art deco features of the building itself anyway. The only fault was that the speakers in the room were crackling a bit oh, and my boyfriend thinks he was propositioned by a ""friendly lady looking for business"" when he was at the bar. I think it's a place you will either love or hate, if you like laid back, contemporary hotels without the intimidating factor then this is the place for you!",1,nan,ta_p121
trip_advisor,"Just putting in a good word for the Hard Rock Hotel in Chicago. The reviews I read before going were mixed so we were not sure what to expect. The location was perfect. The hotel was beautiful. Our view was awesome. The room was large enough and very clean. The bed was very comfy. The staff were helpful - especially the concierge, Jared. I couldn't find anything negative to say. If you want to stay in downtown Chicago - you can't go wrong with this cool hotel.",1,nan,ta_p122
trip_advisor,"This is a stylish hotel located right on North Michigan Avenue, a five minute walk from the Orange ""Loop"" line that will get you to and from Midway Airport. Forget about taking a taxi: the train is a $2 ride and less than 40 minutes away. Our room (1802) was immaculate and spacious (350 sq ft, we were told). Decorated in grays and white, the room was comfortable and soothing, not jarring. On the other hand, we found the lighting to be very poor and had trouble reading, finding keys, etc. No kidding. The bathroom was also quite dark and it didnt have a heating lamp. On the positive side, however, there were Aveda products in the bathroom, the windows were huge, so during the day there was tons of natural light, and no issues with darkness. The king size bed was very firm, but had a plush pillow top which made it very comfortable and inviting. We had a largish TV with a DVD player. There is a safe and munchies. The gym is perfect, equipped with treadmills, ellipticals, bikes and weights. It is open 24/7 and there is video surveillance for safety. There are towels, water, headphones, disposable ear pads, and complimentary green apples. Suggestion: if you are on a floor below the 22nd, take the elevator up to 22nd, then down to L2 to get to the gym. This way you dont have to traverse the lobby. The front desk staff is amiable, and very attentive. I read some other reviews about nasty personnel, but did not have that experience at all. I got a free newspaper with a smile, a free stamp when I needed it, change and all the coffee I could tolerate in the morning. The Hard Rock is located less than a 20 minute walk from the Water Tower, the Drury Theater, John Hancock, and magnificent mile. For those who like a thrifty breakfast, we recommend Gourmet Pantry at 155 N. Michigan Avenue [--]. This deli made a delicious egg on a toasted roll with butter on a Sunday morning, no less: $1.99. The hotel has a breakfast buffet for $15.00 per person, but we did not partake of it. We would stay at the Hard Rock again, and think it is great for people with ""tweens."" Not sure about the toddler set, though.",1,nan,ta_p123
trip_advisor,"The Hard Rock hotel is great for a relaxing getaway. The rooms are quiet, the bed is comfortable and the bathroom is a nice size. We had fabulous service and got a great rate. Other than the fact that there were no bathrobes (it's listed as an amenity) and the Sony radio didn't work, it was perfect. Would definitely stay there again!",1,nan,ta_p124
trip_advisor,"We stayed at the Hard Rock for one night to do some intense, day-after-Thanksgiving shopping. It really is a great hotel. The rooms are really cool, and we were just in the basic one. The bed is extremely comfortable, with the softest sheets and great pillows. The technology in the room is great. They have nice upscale tolietries in the bathrooms. For a very modern room, it is still comfortable and homey. The location is perfect for getting wherever you want to go. The staff were very nice and helpful. The bar is really funky with an interesting martini menu. One of the best hotels I have stayed at in Chicago. Really enjoyed it and would highly recommend.",1,nan,ta_p125
trip_advisor,"so my sweetie lures me out under the guise of dinner at the China Grill, upon arrival he tells me his boys are watching the game in a suite upstairs and want to say hi...we arrive at the 35th floor and my oh my!!! SURPRISE!!! ladies and gentlemen THIS is something to be admired...spacious and roomy, yet warm, cozy and inviting...great bed, comfortable furniture, great 42 inch plasmas, and the views are UNBELIEVABLE...my only complaint? a shower should have a door to keep the heat IN...other than that no complaints, room service was great, morning coffee was yummo...overall a fabulous experience!!!",1,nan,ta_p126
trip_advisor,I stayed here August 20 through 23rd with my sixteen year old son and we thoroughly enjoyed this hotel. The price was very reasonable for a hotel located right on Michigan Avenue. The front desk and concierge service was excellent and enhanced our stay by making it easy for us to plan fun activities. The John Entwistle theme on our floor was a nice touch. Any of you single fathers out there can appreciate how difficult it can be to take a fun affordable vacation with your children and The Hard Rock Hotel in Chicago really helped me accomplish just that!,1,nan,ta_p127
trip_advisor,"Stayed for 3 nights for our anniversary. The desk clerk was great and since it was our anniversary, he gave us an upgrade...imagine our surprise when we got off on a floor with only 3 other rooms! Corner tower suite with a view of the river and Michigan ave. Beautiful! Cabs available right outside the lobby... Never paid more than $7 for a cab ride. If you go in Dec. you must go to the ChrisKindl Festival for strudel!",1,nan,ta_p128
trip_advisor,The service from check-in to checkout was excellent - timely and efficient. The room was more then I has expected. It was spacious and laid out very well. I particularly enjoyed the living room area as well as the double closets and separate bath and shower. The bed abd pillows were extremely comfortable. I believe it's the first time I stayed in a hotel that provided a toothbrush and toothpaste in the room. The location was perfect for us as we were able to walk to everywhere we needed to go. I particularly enjoyed the excellent food at theChina Grill which is attached to the Hard Rock hotel. The service was very good and the staff very friendly.,1,nan,ta_p129
trip_advisor,"I was attending a conference at the Mariott. They were booked up and I shared a room at the Hard Rock for a week by default. What a lucky break. This is a beautiful hotel. I am not a fan of all that black/grey vibe and find it a little cheesy. What I loved was the way the Hard Rock left the beautiful old hotel features intact, and decorated around the basic stucture. My room was CLEAN, CLEAN, CLEAN. I want to comment on the staff. What an upbeat group of people. This included the doormen, the front desk, the consierge. They were wonderful! Every morning one of the bell men would find my TV morning news show for me in the bar, while I drank their courtesy coffee. They brought us a refrigerator, IPOD dock, and extra suitcase stand within minutes of check-in. I had a hard time contacting the airport transport. The consierge took care of it for me. While I was waiting for the 4:50 am airport shuttle, one of the bell men found me a cup of coffee in the back. I just couldn't get over how nice and friendly everyone was....great place to stay. I hope to go back with my husband.",1,nan,ta_p130
trip_advisor,"This is a great hotel, in a great location, in a great city !!! There's a cool bar area to the left of the main door when you can hang out and all of the staff are quite funky and look the part. The rooms are spacious and well thought out with a picture of some old rocker(s) in the bathroom ... I had the Beatles and although they're not my cup of tea, I was happy enough with George staring back @ me! The hotel itself is on the corner of Michigan Ave and a short walk will take you to the fabulous shops and restaurants ... try the ""Cheesecake Factory"" or have a meal / cocktail on the top floor of the ""John Hancock Centre"". A slighty longer walk (or a short cab ride) and you're at the ""Navy Pier"" - take a ride on the ""Seadog"" then enjoy all the fun of the fair ... or maybe a drink or two whilst listening to some great live music. This hotel (& city) is WELL worth checking out.",1,nan,ta_p131
trip_advisor,"Awesome hotel, our room overlooked Michigan Ave and we could see the river. Very stylish, trendy room and hotel. Lacked a bit in amenities (pool, etc) but more than made up for it with the location and quality of the hotel. Booked it thought Hotwire for $99 which was awesome value.",1,nan,ta_p132
trip_advisor,"The Hard Rock is glossy and sexy, but an absolutely fantastic hotel.... I was in town for business and stayed here because of it's location, but I absolutely understand why tourists would like it...right on the river, cool art deco building and Millenium Park is just down the street. Regardless- the room was clean, the staff was friendly, but NOT annoying and the bar was fun. I was comfortable having a couple of drinks alone at the end of the day - they were GOOD! I'll definitely try it again!",1,nan,ta_p133
trip_advisor,"The Hard Rock Hotel Chicago has become my favorite hotel. I've stayed there at least 5 times now and have never had anything other than a wonderful experience. As you might have guessed - it has a super Rock & Roll theme, with some music paraphanelia in the lobby and on each floor's elevator lobby. The rooms all have large photo murals that are themed to different musicians. You can request being on the floor of your favorite band (like KISS, Aerosmith, etc...) The rooms are GREAT. Well appointed. SUPER Comfortable beds and luxurious sheets and wonderous pillows. The large TV has a cool sound system that ramps up the viewing experience. There's a spacious desk in each room with a mini bar. I've always had a room with big windows and a view down Michigan Ave (the hotel sits right on Michigan - a block from the canal). The bathrooms are furnished with absolutely great fixtures sporting a great design... some of the showers have windows in side of them (you can shower AND enjoy the view down Michigan!) or close the waterproof drapes. I've never had anything but a great experience with the staff here... front desk, doorman, etc are all great. There's a lobby bar that still feels intimate and has nice energy. Big screen TV to catch the latest scores, too. Of course, Rock & Roll music pumps thru the place. You can stay at a ""plain"" hotel anywhere... but this is a GREAT, WELL DESIGNED, FUN and MEMORABLE HOTEL that you'll want to return back to. If I had one concern - it would be the rather crazy charge for parking your car overnight. My daily car parking rate was close to $50 per night, which I'm sorry to say is about the going rate in the loop. Stay here. Be cool.",1,nan,ta_p134
trip_advisor,A bunch of us got together and we had a great time in this hotel we asked for limes and they gave us like a punch bowl of them the rooms were so awesome you really have to see it to believe how extradionary this hotel is i love the decorations on every floor and being surrounded by such elegance. Will definitely stay here again,1,nan,ta_p135
trip_advisor,"We stayed at the Hard Rock on January 27th, 2009 for $125/night. It is located on Michigan Ave, just two blocks from the Mag Mile, two blocks from Millenium Park, and five blocks from the Chicago Art Institute. Our hotel room was very nice with views of Michigan Ave and a unusually comfy bed. The hotel even offered free coffee in the lobby every morning and free wifi in the rooms. Parking was $45 for valet and $30 for self parking. The staff was very helpful with all of our request.",1,nan,ta_p136
trip_advisor,"The Hard Rock Hotel was a natural choice for me to book a block of rooms for several colleagues traveling into Chicago.. The location is fantastic - a short walk to top notch city points of interest such as Lake Michigan, Millennium Park, and Art Museum - and several fantastic restaurants nearby to choose from. My co-works LOVED the exterior of the building, views from the rooms, the art on the walls, and crisp, clean & hip feeling of the hotel, but not ""too over the top"" for ""business"". By far a better experience than your usual ""chain"" hotel where they shuffle you in and out and boring rooms. Here you feel special...for the same price. The lobby and bar have fun & cozy areas to just hang out and watch the people pass on Michigan Ave (or catch a real rock star in the lobby!)",1,nan,ta_p137
trip_advisor,"Stayed here for 4 nights in Apri. From check in the stay was perfect all round, staff were so helpfuly and friendly especially Chris and Scott. The location couldn't be better right on Michigan Avenue so easy access to everything. Room was lovely and spacious and always clean and tidy at the end of the day. Will definately recommend it to friends and family.",1,nan,ta_p138
trip_advisor,"my husband and l stayed here after a very hectic week in new york. The room was very spacious and clean, the bed was huge and extremely comfortable. I really liked the Aveda bathroom products, great smell. We had room service the first night and it arrived really quick and piping hot. Compliments to the chef. The concierge was very helpful as we needed to find a few places and we were meeting up with friends and did not know how to get to Navy pier, directions were given to us accompanied by a map. The weekend we were there it was their annual air and navy show, this was spectacular. The whole of the last day of the show we spent at Navy pier and the Millenium park. Location of the hotel is very good for most things especially shopping. If we are ever in Chicago again we will definately stay here.",1,nan,ta_p139
trip_advisor,"We stay at Hilton for 4 nights last march. It was a pleasant stay. We got a large room with 2 double beds and 2 bathrooms, The TV was Ok, a 27' CRT Flat Screen. The coincierge was very friendly when we need. The room was very cleaned when we arrived, we ordered some pizzas from room service and the pizza was Ok also.The main Hall is beautiful. The breakfast is charged, 20 dollars, kinda expensive. The internet access (WiFi) is charged, 13 dollars/day. Pros: Low rate price, huge rooms, close to attractions at Loop, close to metro station. Cons: Expensive breakfast, Internet access charged. Tip: When leaving the building, always use the Michigan Av exit. Its a great view.",1,nan,ta_p140
trip_advisor,"This is a stunning hotel in an excellent location in the greatest of US cities. The entrance and lobby of the hotel indicates its class. The bedrooms are large and comfortable and the customer service is second to none. It is located on South Michigan directly across the road from Grant and Millenium Park. It also has a free shuttle to the Water Tower in the heart of the Magnificent Mile. For Blues fans, Buddy Guy's Legends Club is situated immediately behind the Hotel. Highly recommended.",1,nan,ta_p141
trip_advisor,"Staying at this hotel was one of the high points of a last minute, budget Valentines weekend trip for my husband and me. We got a great rate -- $70 -- on Priceline. Close to the subway (red line) and we got from O'Hare to the hotel in less than an hour for $3.50 for both of us. We were able to check in more than 4 hours early. Room was great -- very clean, good closet space and fantastic bedding. Had one expensive drink at the Irish bar, but the bartender's advice on restaurants and clubs to check out made it worth the price. Concierge was helpful, too. Overall, service was terrific, room was great and staying there was a treat. I would stay there again any time, especially at that price.",1,nan,ta_p142
trip_advisor,"went to chicago for a week in may, decided to be good to ourselves and stay in the hilton, we were not disapointed. perhaps it was becuse there were quite a few conventions going on and a lot of people were only staying 1 or 2 nights but we got upgraged to exceutive level. we had 2 double beds with a bathroom each. they beds and pillows were too die for, so so comfy ant the end of a day when we seemed to have walked for miles. all the staff were very helpful. a lot of guests seemed to ignore the staff especially the chamber maids who they seemed to think they were in their way so perhaps that why some people felt these people were rude or unhelpful. about 2 blocks away on Harrison is a cafe called ""Orange"" which you have to make the only place you will have breakfast, the cafe and the staff are suberb. expect a 15 min wait on a sat & sun morning.",1,nan,ta_p143
trip_advisor,"We stayed here from Nov. 30 to Dec 2 and had a wonderful time. The hotel is just beautiful and the service was excellent from check in to the maid staff to the bartenders in Kitty O'Shea's. We had a room with a king bed that was very comfortable and had very nice feather pillows. You can request other types if you have a problem with feathers. The large flat screen TV was very nice. Bath products were by Crabtree & Evelyn and included shampoo, conditioner, mouthwash and bady lotion. Plenty of coffee was provided. We drank and had snacks at Kitty O'Shea's. The crowd was fun and there was live Irish folk music each night. Good selection of beer and good Shepards Pie, Cheese Dip and Crisps! The location worked very well for us. We walked to the Art Museum and Buddy Guys Blues Club is right across the street. And shopping was a breeze using the shuttle! The cab ride to the Museum of Science and Industry was quite far though and cost about $15 each way. An excellent weekend getaway!",1,nan,ta_p144
trip_advisor,"We travel to Chicago regularly and have always wanted to stay at the Hilton Chicago. We booked a PriceLine room on the weekend of the half marathon. The place was busy, but the staff certainly found time for each individual guest. The room was nice and just what we expected. The pool area is also very nice for a downtown hotel. The location was great as we were taking in the Bears 49ers game on a Thursday night and a Sox game on a Friiday night. We would certainly stay there again and would recomment it to others. Great quality even at the regular room price.",1,nan,ta_p145
trip_advisor,"I stayed here for a conference and got the conference rate of $149. I was worried that I wouldn't get a nice room, since it was the weekend before the election and the hotel is across the street from Grant Park, so it could easily have gotten a lot more for the nicer rooms. I requested a quiet room away from elevators and foot traffic, and that is exactly what I was assigned (perhaps because I am also a 'silver' member?). It was a beautiful room with windows on two sides, a king sized bed. The room was quiet, comfortable and immaculate. The maid even left a thank you note for the tip I had left. All the staff were helpful, polite and cheerful. I appreciated the fact that I could actually purchase a breakfast for under $15 (oatmeal, coffee, and juice)--something not possible at a lot of big hotels, like the Hyatt I stayed at last year.",1,nan,ta_p146
trip_advisor,"We had a great experience at this hotel. The hotel is Huge! The rooms were very clean, well appointed, and our room was very roomy with a great view of the snow covered park. The Staff was so nice and very helpfull. Donald, at the the Concierge desk scored us tickets to WICKED the day of the performance, and on a Holiday weekend too. They were great seats and a reasonable price. He worked very hard for us to see that show. They truely topped off what was a Fun New Years Celebration. This will be my first pick when I return in the spring.",1,nan,ta_p147

We knew we were paying a little more than some other hotels but it was well worth every penny.",1,nan,ta_p148
trip_advisor,"I stayed at this hotel over the weekend of the Chicago Bears Fan Convention (Feb 27- March 1). The hotel is beautiful. I had a Towers room. I had a decent view of the city (Sears Tower). The room was a little small but had two bathrooms (1 King bed). The Tower room has it's own registration area and comes with a free continental breakfast, evening snacks and free sodas throughout the day. The registration/ lounge is on the 24th floor and overlooks Lake Michigan. The hotel was full but service was excellent. The location is convenient but there are a number of homeless people within a block or two (especially toward the El train). We loved our stay at this hotel and never had to take a cab or rent a car. I will stay here again. Hilton offered a Sunday night free on their website with a 3 day stay. This made the cost reasonable (for Chicago). However, the Pavilion restaurant left a lot to be desired. The pub on the first floor was a good place to hang out and have a drink.",1,nan,ta_p149
trip_advisor,"My stay was quick but awesome. After a long day, seeing a substantial line at check-in was a bit of a groaner, but then i saw the self-serve kiosks. i was checked in with keys in hand in under 3 minutes. in the morning i was able to check out on the TV in my room. the hotel is a beautiful historic landmark with all the amenities of a modern hotel and all the charm of its 1927 origins. The bed was FABULOUSLY comfortable. i wish i could live there. they have many rooms wtih 2 bathrooms. i stayed in a room like that once with a friend and we didn't know ahead of time that we had two bathrooms. talk about squeals of delight. that was about 7 years ago in virginia beach. i was by myself at the hilton and had no need for a room with two bathrooms, but it's the first time i've seen this since. what a great feature!",1,nan,ta_p150
trip_advisor,"Thirty years ago, we had a tiny ""room"" and indifferent service. This time, the service was superb and friendly throughout, with special commendation for the waiters and waitresses at the coffee shop, the door and bell persons, and the hilton honors person at the front desk. They even lowered our price (to moderately high) when we inquired a few days before our stay. When we want to stay south of the river downtown, we will be back",1,nan,ta_p151
trip_advisor,"Stayed at the Chicago Hilton for three nights and from the minute we walked through the door I was very impressed. Check-in was quick, easy and I was very glad that we were able to check in despite being earlier than the advertised check-in time. We were given a twin room with two bathrooms which was brilliant. It made getting ready to go out much quicker! The hotel location is great opposite the park, which is a must see. Although located on South Michigan Ave it is easily within walking distance of all the shops and sights of the whole of Michigan Ave. Would also recommend the street one block back from Michigan Ave for good shopping. For breakfast I would recommend grabbing a muffin, croissant or bagel from the bar just past reception rather than going for the more expensive breakfast in the restaurant. For evening entertainment Kitty O'Sheas is a must. Typical Irish bar with good drinks and live music. Finally the bed at Hilton Chicago is the most comfortable bed ever. I would have taken it home if I could! Definately made for a good nights sleep.",1,nan,ta_p152
trip_advisor,"We loved the hotel. When I see other posts about it being shabby I can't for the life of me figure out what they are talking about. Rooms were large with TWO bathrooms, lobby was fabulous, pool was large with two hot tubs and huge gym, staff was courteous. For us, the location was great--across the street from Grant Park with a great view of Buckingham Fountain and close to all the museums and theatres. I'm sure others would rather be north of the river closer to the Magnificent Mile but we enjoyed the quieter and more scenic location. Got it for $105 on Hotwire. What a bargain for such a nice hotel.",1,nan,ta_p153

When I checked in, the staff was very attentive, I showed a little consideration for the friendly attitude (small tip) and was upgraded to a huge upper floor room complete with a bar! I didn't get the ""Priceline"" glare and it paid off for all involved. The air and water show was underway on the lake front, and we had planes flying over our room. The kids thought it was great. That night we had a great view of the fireworks at Navy Pier. The Sunday morning breakfast buffet at the hotel was very good and the price was not out of reason.

Great location too! Walking distance from the Art Museum, Millennium Park, Grant Park (right across the street) and a quick cab ride to McCormick Place. If I were in the city again I would love to stay there again.",1,nan,ta_p156
trip_advisor,"We booked our stay through Priceline.com and got a great deal. We were only staying one night and we had our 2 year old with us. At check-in, we were upgraded to a suite with a lake view of Lake Michigan. It was beautiful. The suite had a king bed with a living room and a bar and mini-fridge which we didn't need, but if we were staying longer, it would have been a godsend. This hotel is in close proximity with Grant Park which has the beautiful Buckingham Fountain. We walked around the park and even saw a movie being filmed....but if you are looking for a hotel with a lot of restaurants around it, this isn't the one. We ended up eating at the Irish Pub inside the hotel (Kitty O'Shea's) which has great food. (We have stayed here before and always end up eating here.) There are a lot of attractions within a mile including the Field Museum, Shedd Aquarium, Soldier Field, and Navy Pier. They may not be walking distance but we could see them from our hotel window. Overall, we had another wonderful stay at the Chicago Hilton. (Our 4th stay) The only downside is the expensive parking within the hotel.....41 dollars a night is kind of ridiculous.",1,nan,ta_p157
trip_advisor,"Great place, great room, great location. Even though there was a big meeting going on (Rainbow Girls in all their enormous gowns) the only consequence for us was slow elevators.

If you prefer discreet modern boutiquey-type hotels, maybe this wouldn't be your thing. However if you enjoy old style glamour and glitz, you will be bowled over by this hotel. The place literally sparkles thanks to the enormous chandeliers that are everywhere in the lobby. Tons of celebs have stayed here over the decades and the history of the hotel and past guests etc is fascinating. We got a very reasonable rate for our stay and could not fault anything about this very special place!",1,nan,ta_p159

The location was perfect, walking distance to Michigan Ave for all the shopping and touristy stuff, and literally 100 yards to the L (red line) for getting out to the surrounding areas. The room was great: not exactly 'wow' decor but clean and really well stocked. I was expecting a 'suite' to be a larger than average hotel room with seperate sitting area. It was actually a 3-room mini-apartment, with an open lounge/kitchen, bedroom, and bathroom. Two flatscreen TVs and a huge bed. Breakfast buffet eggs and bacon were great for the hangover(!), and the kitchen meant that I could cook up some lunch rather than eat out if needed.",1,nan,ta_p160
trip_advisor,"My sister and I went to Chicago for a weekend and decided to stay at this hotel because I have a friend who works at Homewood Suites here in Cleveland so we got a discount. The valets were really friendly, you get in and out service when you pay for parking with the hotel. Check-in is on the 6th floor because there are restaurants beneath the hotel at street level. That also made finding the hotel tricky because I expected a groove to pull into and it turned out that I just had to pull over to the right side of the street. The lady at the front desk was friendly and informative. Our room was very clean. The fact that it is an extented stay hotel was nice when it came to bringing home leftovers from restaurants, storing and reheating food. The complimentary breakfast was great! They have real food such as eggs, bacon, french toast, cereal, bagels, juice, milk, and yogurt. The hotel is in walking distance from everything and there is a trolley that goes to Navy Pier and passes by Michigan Avenue. They also have free WiFi. Overall, I would definately stay here again and I would recommend it to others.",1,nan,ta_p161

Walking distance to many shopping, restaurant, and everything else. From valet people to front desk people, they were all very friendly and helpful. The best thing about this hotel (other than the awesome location) is that all rooms are suites. You can choose 1 king or 2 double which will be inside the room and you get another sofa bed in the living room area. You get 2 TVs also.

I would recommend getting a pass, we got a 3 day pass and it was well worth it for $14 which we got at jewel osco, not too far from the hotel, for the most part the majority of the people that were there were older people on a business trip and families, but us three girls didn't mind, so i would definitely recommend this place, it was one of the cheapest places were found out of all the other hotels.",1,nan,ta_p164

There is a lady named Connie who works the breakfast shift and she greets everyone and always remembers you from years before.

They genuinely seem happy to be working here and can't do enough for their guests. The rooms are large and clean and seem to have good insulation from each other (we didn't hear a thing from our neighbours and the hotel was quite busy). The hotel is well placed for walking to the shops on Michigan Ave, or catching a bus or subway. There is a Jewel Osco and a Trader Joes each within a couple of blocks, which are perfect for stocking up on groceries etc. My husband heartily recommends 'Binnies Beverage Depot' for a huge variety of beer. Now all we need is an excuse to return to Chicago next year - then we can make it four years on the run at the Homewood Suites, because we wouldn't stay anywhere else!",1,nan,ta_p170
trip_advisor,"When making my reservation, I made it for one of the most busiest weekends during the summer Memorial Day. The staff was able to get my family in at an affordable rate. The suites are very spacious, clean, cozy, and comfortable. Upon on arriving staff were friendly, willing to exceed expectations, and serve me with enthusiasm. The Hot Breakfast was delicious each morning. The beds are very comfortable and provided a good nights rest. I would recommend this hotel to my friends and anyone who need additional space when traveling and on a budget compared to other Chicago hotels.",1,nan,ta_p171
trip_advisor,"The location of this hotel was excellent as it is just beside the subway and the bus stop for the free trolley bus to Navy Pier is just beside the hotel. The room was very spacious. Kind of too big for a solo traveler. The view from the room was excellent and it was a great view to sleep at night. The bathroom was spacious too and the room has a big wardrobe. The kitchen has microwave oven and cooking utensils. Some of the cooking utensils were a bit dirty, probably because they had not been used for sometime. However, the microwave oven was very useful as I can heat up food to eat at night. You can easily walk to the magnificent mile by cutting across the shopping mall across the road. Do check out Pizzeria Uno which is near the hotel that serves the delicious deep dish pizza. For cheaper food, do check out the foodcourt at the shopping mall. The hotel also serves breakfast and dinner from Mon to Thur. I did not find the food that fantastic but it was pretty decent. I will strongly recommend this hotel to everyone going to Chicago.",1,nan,ta_p172
trip_advisor,"My family and I stayed at this hotel during an extended weekend trip in July, 08. We had (3) 1 bedroom suites. Great Location in downtown Chicago. Within walking distance to shopping and most downtown tourist attractions. The service was excellent and the hotel staff was friendly. The breakfast buffet was very good but the eating area can get crowded. I recommend going early. The rooms were quiet and clean. I highly recommend this hotel for families and for travelers staying >2-3 days. We would stay here again. Parking is expensive, about $28/day. It is valet. The cheapest self parking I could find in the area was $24/days so we did valet parking. The valet and bell staff were very helpful and friendly. This is my 3rd experience with Homewood Suites (3 different cities). I have had a great experience each time.",1,nan,ta_p173
trip_advisor,"Stayed over Memorial Weekend for 2 nites, 2 rooms. Great Hotel, we always love breakfast in morning,and drinks in even when applicable. Around the corner from magnificent Mile,and close to lots of restaurants. Staff was great, we even checked in early before noon,and other room available less than hour later. Fresh fruit was available to us,and bell guys are cool. Suites are on small side compared to other homewoods but no complaints here, house cleaning kept our room clean,and we felt safe!",1,nan,ta_p174
trip_advisor,"Our first visit to Chicago and I really cannot wait to go back. The hotel was in a great location and every member of staff we had contact with were exceptionally helpful. Particular mention should go to the door staff who were amazingly helpful. The room was clean, quiet and spacious, if only every hotel were like this.",1,nan,ta_p175
trip_advisor,"Just back from a business trip. The Homewood is in a great location just off the Magnificent Mile, includes a great breakfast, heavy hors d'ouevres for dinner with beer and all for a pre-paid rate of $129. Without a doubt the best value in Chicago for a long, long time.",1,nan,ta_p176
trip_advisor,"Perfect location, clean and courteous staff all added up to a great stay. Its in an area with plenty of stores ( The Mile) and restaurants. Hotel lobby is on the 6th floor and the elevator to get there was annoyingly slow but overall I would highly recommend this place regardless if your there with a family, friends or on business. The subway to Wrigley is a 1/2 block away from the front door.",1,nan,ta_p177
trip_advisor,This hotel was very beautiful. I went with a group of 4 friends and we had a blast. It was very centrally located and was close to all sorts of transportation. The Continental breakfast was magnificent! I didn't see much of the staff but all of the men at the front door were extremely helpful.,1,nan,ta_p178
trip_advisor,I love the free breakfast and dinners on weeknights. The hotel is clean and nice rooms The pool needs some updating(but kids don't care) My friend and I took our granddaughters for a grandma grandaughter outing and this hotel was perfect,1,nan,ta_p179
trip_advisor,"I got a Sunday night stay for only $50 off of Priceline.com, so it would be hard to complain...but this was truly a great hotel, even if I paid double. The first impression you get when you walk through the sliding doors of the Hyatt Regency Chicago is WOW. The lobby is beautiful with a upscale mall type of look to it with an open area that has a restaurant, plenty of couches,seats etc to people watch and a lake with water fountains. You take the escalator to the concierge/directory/check in area. The hotel let me check in at 12pm (I had a 3pm check in time). I suggest you call ahead like I did so they know you are coming early.The women at the desk was friendly and when I requested a higher level floor she was more than happy to look it up and even told me ""I have a room on the 18th floor with a veiw of the river or you can go higher with no view"". I thought it was pretty nice to give me that information so that I wouldnt get stuck with a room with a view of a wall. The rooms are big (I had a doubles room) The beds were beautiful with great pillows,blankets,headboards etc. An Ipod alarm clock was a nice 21st century touch to the room. Great to plug in your ipod, listen to some music and get ready for a night out or when relaxing after a long day of touring Chicago. The view was very nice and the bathroom was spotless and had great toiletries. Another great feature is the concierge area's computers that gives you access to printing your boarding pass before you get to the airport. You simply look at the screen, click on your airline icon and following the instructions. I had my boarding passes in about a minute. Came in handy when I got to OHare and was able to skip a long line of frustrated passengers. I was only in the hotel for 1 day, but it was by far one of the better hotel experiences I have had and I travel alot. It is a business hotel, but definitely a great choice for families and couples. Definitely would stay here again when Im passing through Chicago.",1,nan,ta_p180
trip_advisor,"We booked our room on Priceline, and got a good deal at around $100 per night. We stayed for the first 2 nights of our US trip so didnt use too many of the hotel's facilities The hotel is centrally located, just over the Chicago River from the shops at North Michigan Avenue, and around a mile from Navy Pier Our room was clean and comfortable, and on the 29th floor we had a good view of the city, and could just about see Lake Michigan (though the weather was very bad). The layout of the room is a little peculiar, with the bed facing away from the window, but over all we have no complaints about this hotel, and unlike some other reviews we were not disturbed at all by noise from other guests So, pros and cons: Pros: Helpful and friendly staff Clean and comfortable throughout Spacious rooms Large and airy public areas Starbucks and gift shop in lobby Cons A large hotel, so a long walk from the elevators to the front desk / lobby area",1,nan,ta_p181
trip_advisor,"I booked a room at the Hyatt through Priceline and was able to get a rate of $45/night! Can't go wrong with that! The rooms are nice, spacious, clean and contain all the amenties a traveler would need. I have to say that I have fallen in love with the Hyatt chain due to their customer service. I have stayed at a few of their hotels in different cities and the staff has always been extremely friendly, which you don't often see at other hotels. I used the self-check in machine, and the customer service person checked in on me to make sure everything was going smoothly. Then, when she saw that my room was not on a high level, she offered to have it changed for me so that I could have a better view. I would highly recommend this hotel!",1,nan,ta_p182
trip_advisor,"Great hotel in a wonderful location. I stayed in this hotel last weekend for one night before coming home and I loved it. I couldn't recommend it highly enough. Evidently popular and busy, the staff were still helpful. The rooms were lovely and spacious and clean. Bathrooms were clean, bright and spacious also. I'd definitely recommend this hotel too, it's close to the magnificant mile.",1,nan,ta_p183
trip_advisor,Stayed here for 3 nights for a Bridgestone/Firestone convention. No complaints. Room was great with a beautiful view. Staff was very accommodating. Had drinks and appetizers in main bar. Fantastic! Great location. Yes it's a huge hotel as it's used for conventions but that didn't stop it from being a great place.,1,nan,ta_p184
trip_advisor,"My wife and I stayed at this hotel at the end of May, 2009. She came for the weekend for a function and we extended the trip to take in the city. We got a deal on this hotel through TravelZoos. $249/night stay for $99/night plus we got the full buffet breakfast. The room was wonderful. Extremely large King size bed with expansive sitting area. We are used to smaller hotels with little room to move. The bed was extremely comfortable with lots of pillows. No wear or damage in room at all except sink tap dripped a bit (poor taps). We could have upgraded to river view for $20/night but chose not to. We enjoyed the room for what it was. 22nd floor looking south. The buffet breakfast was great. Lots to choose from and very fresh with made to order eggs, non stop coffee and juice and the servers were so eager to please. Great to have breakfast included in night stay. Might be a bit dear to pay at $22/person. It was nice to sit and relax with good breakfast, coffee and newspaper and not have to figure where to catch a morning meal. Concierge desk was most helpful in suggesting places to eat, always informative and ready to provide maps, directions, multiple suggestions and even make the reservations. Cards included to admit without paying cover charges at some jazz clubs. Location was great. Blocks from El and other transportation and easy walking distance to the parks and right on the river. If in Chicago again, would not hesitate to stay here again. A swimming pool would have been nice but we did not miss it.",1,nan,ta_p185
trip_advisor,"Staff were friendly, room was well kept like a typical Hyatt location. Hotel is huge, with two buildings and over 2000 rooms. Good location, close to Michigan Ave and the subway. Parking is $48/day. Ouch! I bid on it on Priceline for $59.",1,nan,ta_p186
trip_advisor,"I stayed here for business and loved it. Got it for $93 inc tax on Priceline, an incredible deal for this hotel. If I wasn't on priceline I would expect to pay $200 per night (maybe more) for this location/level of service. It's in the heart of downtown Chicago, walkable to many locations. The lobby is very impressive, the room was very nice. No complaints at all, from check-in to check-out. I was alone so didn't go to the bar but it looked like people were really enjoying themselves. It was full of people all the time. I want to stay here when I come back with my husband for a fun weekend in the city.",1,nan,ta_p187
trip_advisor,"I asked for a high floor away from the elevator and that is what I got. The room was pleasantly decorated, functional and very clean. I didn't need a whole lot of service but when I did they were pleasant and prompt. I used the fitness center which was well equipped and everything was in working order. It is in a great location at one end of the Michigan Avenue shopping district.",1,nan,ta_p188
trip_advisor,"On our visit to Chicago, we chose the Hyatt due to its location in downtown, within walking distance to most major attractions, such as Sears Tower, Magnificent Mile, Grant/Millenium Parks, etc. Subway & bus stops very close by to travel to other locations in the city . Overall the hotel was very nice, clean, and at a great location. Was in a safe area. Went to beautiful Wrigley Field and Soldier Field and saw both teams play. I love Chicago and would defenitely stay here again!",1,nan,ta_p189
trip_advisor,"Named my price on priceline. $50.00 Bucks. Hotel room was great. Clean, Clean and new. Fresh crisp sheets, comfortable bed, flat screen TV, clean carpet, nice bath, etc. Short distance to food and sightseeing. I highly recommend this property. Be prepared to pay over $40.00 per night to park. Hey, Its a hyatt. They also charge $5.00 for a bottle of water that is normally a buck. For a total of $100.00 nightly stay in Chicago this place is it just don't drink the bottled water. Happy Travels",1,nan,ta_p190

trip_advisor,"This comes a little late as I'm finally catching up on my reviews from the past several months:) A dear friend and I stayed at the Hyatt Regency in late October 2007 for one night while visiting a friend and her husband from out of town. This hotel is perfect, IMO. Easy check in and check out. Lovely, clean, comfortable rooms with great views of the city. I know this area pretty well and it's very convenient to many downtown Chicago attractions. We had dinner and went clubing with our friends around Division St.. We had no problems getting cabs back and forth to the Hyatt and there's even public transportation right near by but we didn't bother since we only needed cabs from and to the hotel. Parking, as is usual for Chicago, was expensive but we were able to get our car out quickly (however, we left on a Sunday morning, not exactly a high traffic time although it was a Bears homegame day, so a bit busier than usual I would think). No problems at all and the best part is that we got a rate of $100 through Hotwire, a downright steal for this area of Chicago and the quality of the hotel.",1,nan,ta_p192
trip_advisor,Stayed in a Junior Suite which was beautiful and spacious. It had the largest flat screen tv I have ever seen in a hotel (great excuse to catch up on some movies) The breakfast buffet was great and was served in the hotels huge atrium which was nice. The service was top notch. Stayed in a lower floor in the East tower which was great as there was no waits for an elevator and they were always empty. The Shed aquarium was a complete waste of time and money but the Field musium was amazing. Chicago remains tied with London as my favourite city.,1,nan,ta_p193
trip_advisor,"We arrived at 10:30 am on a Friday, and they had a room ready for us by 11:30 am, mind you check in is not until 3:00pm. We got our room on Priceline for $65.00 per night and stayed 3 nights. We were upgraded - for free - to a suite. I think I was so blown away by that, that I forgot to thank them at check-in! Our room was fantastic. It also had a wet bar and a fridge. The bathroom was quite large and had a nice sized closet with many hangers. I knew from previous reviews to not touch the mini-bar. The bed and pillows were very comfortable. The room was very clean. Every employee there went out of their way to be friendly and helpful. We stayed on the 25th floor of the east tower and had a quiet room. Yes, you could hear people in the hallways, but only because they were rude and were yelling. These were not children, they were adults. I don't know why everyone complains about $48 for parking. This is Chicago and every other hotel we saw charged just as much, some without in/out privledges. We didn't use any of the restaurants or the health club. We tried to eat at the Corner Bakery but it was too crowded. Breakfast at nearby Houlihan's had a buffet for $9.99 per person. Also the grocery store behind the hotel is great. There is a 7-11 not too far away. I don't know why there are so many bad reviews on this hotel. Yes, it's a big hotel. If you don't want a busy lobby, don't stay in a 2,000 plus room hotel!! I loved the Hotel and would recommend it to anyone. Not one problem. Wasn't too busy for me. Would stay here again in a heartbeat.",1,nan,ta_p194
trip_advisor,"We paid $75 a night through Priceline, which is excellent for June. Our room had a fantastic view of the Hancock Building and the river. The room was large, clean and had a couch, easy chair and desk chair. The bedding was the newer 'non-bedspread' style, the bed was comfortable, the bathroom was large and, well, we were pleased with the room and the Hyatt in every way. We ate at the lobby restaurant, which is attractively decorated and was bustling with activity when we were there. We only got Cobb Salads, so I don't know if the food, in general, is good or not. The Cobb was so-so. Our only complaint was the $48 fee to park your car over-night and the $13 daily fee for the internet. Many places are offering free internet these days and I wish the Hyatt would hop on board with this concept. We hated to leave!",1,nan,ta_p195
trip_advisor,"Triple A rate with upgrade to view room was less than $200 which also included breakfast vouchers. Had a great view of river, lake, Wrigley Bldg. & Tribune Bldg. Most major restaurants, Shopping, Sightseeing attractions within walking distance. Large room with a very comfortable bed.",1,nan,ta_p196
trip_advisor,"Booked this on priceline for an insanely low price of $65 a night. The BF and I were amazed when we got there--the person checking us in was friendly and helpful to suggest some local nightspots and the room was gorgeous! A nice upscale, downtown feel and super comfy beds. We had a fabulous view from the 25th floor that inlcluded a sliver of Lake Michigan, a sliver of the Taste of Chicago crowds, and some friendly office workers in the builiding next door who waved to us a few times. Seriously. We had a pretty anonymous experience the rest of our stay--which was fine with us. The hotel consists mainly of 2 towers and is like a huge, sprawling city inside. But we weren't there to stay in the hotel room the entire time...we like to get out and explore as much as possible. The location was fantastic. Easy walking distance to Michigan Avenue and the rest of downtown. We walked for blocks well into the night and never felt like we needed a cab. I also highly recommend the Urban Cruise on the river (the entrance is right across from the hotel)--we saw some amazing architecture from the boat and got to cruise Lake Michigan a bit too. Don't park your car here if you don't need to--it's very expensive. Park downtown or ditch the rental car--you won't need it anyway, you can walk to tons of stuff or grab a cab. Love Chicago and totally recommend this hotel!",1,nan,ta_p197
trip_advisor,"Check-in was fast, the room was perfect, and there were no problems. This is a standard big-city business hotel with every amenity imaginable. I got a very good deal for a one-night stay, but they made the money back from the exorbitant parking rate and the absurd access fee for wireless internet. If you are bored of the routine hotel fare, walk two blocks to Gourmet Pantry (155 N. Michigan) for a refreshing change.",1,nan,ta_p198
trip_advisor,I stayed at the Hyatt for a two nights on a business trip. My room was oddly shaped to give a stunning view of the river and NBC Building.

Nice room, great linens, clean bathroom, and very quiet. Parking is really high ($48). I understand some peopel saying the rooms need to be updated, but everything was clean and worked well. At ,ost, the rooms were a bit dark. I had a late night drink at the bar, which was reasonably priced. i did not eat there, but the menu seemed pretty good, albeit with the typical hotel mark-ups to be expected.

The hotel is in walking distance to millenium park, museums and the aquarium. There is also a lot of shopping - window shopping is best though, considering the sales tax is 9.5%!

We got a good rate on the rooms but did not have breakfast in the hotel as it was very expensive as was the Wifi at $17 per day.

This is a tremendous, towering hotel in one of the best locations in Chicago -- right on the Magnificent Mile and superbly convenient for shopping and well placed for the business area. My room was in the Historic Tower -- a 1920s Masonic Club which has been converted at enormous expense. The effort has been worthwhile. My room was very large and well furnished, with a beautiful bathroom which contained a separate shower cubicle. It had breathtaking views down Michigan Avenue. There is a superb recreation centre (with an impressive swimming pool) beautiful bars and a good restaurant, Zest, that serves a great breakfast. There is wifi in the rooms ($9.95 per day) and tea and coffee making facilities. No trouser press, but there is an ironing board and iron. The staff is friendly and anxious to please. I recommend this hotel in the strongest possible terms. It's expensive, but it will be difficult to find a better one in Chicago.",1,nan,ta_p206

There were charges for almost everything, although I did not incur any of these. Our room was a little small for the class of hotel, but not overwhelmingly small. Not a true complaint, but the elevators were very slow. My comparison was that we stayed in an equally aged hotel in a different city during our trip, and the Intercontinental's were significantly slower. That's it, no more little nit picks. The staff was excellent, the doormen being the highlight. The hotel bar was also very nice. The hotel was immaculately clean. I would definitely travel to this hotel again.",1,nan,ta_p207

I booked 4 nights at the Intercontinental and was pleased with the elegance and convenient location (an easy walk to the conference). From the lobby to the rooms, this hotel lives up to it's storied reputation. (The indoor pool seems to be imported from the set of a Busby Berkeley movie!) And even tho' I was there for a conference, the hotel's location on the Mag Mile and a quick jaunt to restaurants and theaters, made for a very pleasant stay at a very affordable price.",1,nan,ta_p212

Very nice rooms, great view, attentive staff, convenient location just north of the Tribune Tower & the river, and nice fitness club at $16 for the entire stay. The only downside is I couldn't get over the feeling that I was being nickle & dimed: $10 a day for Wi-Fi, $6 bottles of water in the room, $26 mini-bottle of wine in the fridge, tipping multiple staff for carrying the same bags, etc. Their in-house restaurant Zest is Zagat rated though I'm not sure why. Within a 5 minute walk there are plenty of great restaurants with much better food than Zest. But, next time I need to be near the Loop I'd stay at the InterContinental again.",1,nan,ta_p213

We avoided the expensive pitfalls of the hotel extras such as bottled water and items in the room fridge. The beds were great, the rooms were kept clean and the staff was very friendly. Great martinis in the hotel bar. I really can't understand the negative reviews. I know you can't please everyone, but in some cases I simply don't believe their claims.

The room they had us in was small and had no view of anything except the wall of the other part of the hotel, but it was very clean, tastefully decorated and cozy. We had a great vacation, walking all over town until we ended up near the Planetarium which was where we then turned around and saw the skyline of Chicago and were just wow. So anyway, the hotel is great, the service was great, the room was very nice- I would recommend this hotel to anyone though I work at the front desk of a hotel myself and the previous person's comment about how she wasn't able to get adjoining rooms, well, internet sites don't guarantee things like that anyway- you've got to call the hotel direct and verify things like that. There's a note about that on internet sites as well- no room type/location is guaranteed. 5 stars out of 5 for this hotel.",1,nan,ta_p219
trip_advisor,"Dispite what other are saying, this was one, if not the best Hotel stay in Chicago I have had. I travel to the Big City about three times a year for pleasure and The James rates up with the best. I was upgraded and the staff made the stay worth my special weekend visit. I don't believe you will be disapointed.",1,nan,ta_p220
trip_advisor,"The James hotel is located close to everything in Chicago, the miracle mile, Pizza House Uno,Rush street, The Water Tower everything. We walked everywhere because everything was close by. The rooms are very modern and a little on the small side. But the bed was very comfortable, Very! The service is very good and the calls are answered professionally and nicely. All service was very fast and through. The lobby is a liitle small but that keeps the riff raff from hanging out in it, the bar service was good. The drink prices were high but what do you expect in a hotel bar. I got a great deal from leading hotels of the world for my stay of 3 days was just over $400.00 for a 5 star hotel that's cheap. Due to the location, price and service I may stay there again. But I think my next trip may take me to Trump's hotel in Chi Town. The James is a good stay . The doorman at the hotel are Great! Always pleasent, with a smile and very good service.",1,nan,ta_p221
trip_advisor,"I found this wonderful Hotel ! The location is awesome, just minutes away from all the shopping, Restaurants and Bars you could possibly want . I was in town for an interview, so I was really nervous . I ended up suggesting the Hotel Restaurant for my interview and they took such a good care of us, they made me feel so comfortable that I was hardly nervous at all. And the place was pack! The room was superb! Really cool design . I had a room they call an apartment, and it was fantastic! The natural light you get in this room is awesome, and I am very sensitive to dark places. They have a full bar in the room , which I was able to use to entertain my friends that night. I went to the gym for a little bit of exercise and I have to say I have never seen such a extensive facility in a hotel. All the staff made me feel like I was family. They were available to me at any time, and so friendly ! I will definitely be back for another stay.",1,nan,ta_p222
trip_advisor,"Room: I stayed in the 16thz floor. 2 double bed room. The room has a decent size. Equipment is state of the art. The Furniture are stylish. Room Size was very nice. I could have left my big suitcase opened throughout the stay (which rarely happens in most hotels ;)) 42"" LCD Screen Complimentary WiFi in the room The bed and pillows are of extrodinary quality which provided an excellent deep sleep to me. Location Located quite central. Shopping streets are in reach of 5 minutes by feet. Midway Airport is in reach by cab within 30 minutes (~30 USD). Service - Spa and Fitness exists - though I did not use. - Restuarant (not used) - Business Center - Very friendly and helpful staff. (even printed our boarding passes at the reception) I do travel frquently, and do recommend this hotel for a business stay, as also for an overnight with friends going shopping, partying whatever in the city center of Chicago. Pricing was very moderate for teh standard being provided at a downtown hotel.",1,nan,ta_p223
trip_advisor,"My stay at the The James was perfect. My room was thoughtfully designed: the lighting, the storage space, the bar area, the eating nook and everything else in the room was purposeful and pretty to look at. The staff was friendly and and genuinely accomadating. The restaurant (Primehouse) echoed the above. Great service and one of the best steaks I've had in a very long time.",1,nan,ta_p224
trip_advisor,"We needed an extra night in Chicago after a gratus stay at The Penninsula and won a SkyAuction bid for The James @ $203. This is one of the nicest hotels that I've ever stayed in. Bathroom aside, we felt it equalled The Penninsula in comfort and level of service. I echo all of the superlatives previously written and would love to stay here anytime I'm in town.",1,nan,ta_p225
trip_advisor,"My wife and I stayed at the James recently and we had a great experience. The hotel as others have mentioned is in an ideal location. It's in a quiet location, yet so close to many neighborhoods that you want to go to. We upgraded to a studio room which was totally worth the additional cost. It didnt have all the midcentury furniture that the website photos have, but it was elegantly appointed, spacious, and as we were on the inside of the building very quiet. The service was amazing. Everyone was extremely friendly and helpful, as well as knowledgeable. This was true from the doormen at the front, to people at the desk and the servers in the restaurant. Both Concierges that we dealt with had great suggestions, and were able to understand our style and sensibilities when helping us out. The breakfast at Prime downstairs is among the best I have ever had in a hotel, this goes for the room service as well. Dinner there was good, but not great. I mentioned almost flawless, as there was a situation that occurred involving the Spa in the hotel. It involved scheduling and was aggravating, as the hotel actively encourages its use. However, Caroline who is one of the hotel managers did an amazingly competent job of making sure that we were satisfied, following up on progress and was a true pleasure to deal with. The experience could have left a very bad taste in my mouth but was resolved quickly. Overall, we left extremely satisfied with our stay and look forward to many future visits.",1,nan,ta_p226
trip_advisor,"We have just returned from a week at the James Chicago. The hotel is fabulous, very chic and chilled. The service is beyond compare. Check in and out were swift and painless. The Concierge service is also super efficient having located an excellent hair salon and a couple of fab restaurants for us during our stay. The hotel restaurant itself is rated 5 in the top 10 in Chicago - voted by Chicago residents. We stayed on the 14th floor with great views of the city. The room (a deluxe king) was equipped with a great selection of cocktail making lovelies, hairdryer, safe, tv, robes & slippers, a very interesting selection of minibar items (one of which was a real surprise!) including crisps/snacks a first aid kit and an umbrella! We also had a spotless and elegant bathroom with Kiehls products and a cosy little dining area. The ipod dock/CD/radio and complimentary chillout CD were a nice touch and husband liked the enormous plasma tv. The super comfy bed ensured a good snooze and complimentary WiFi allowed us to plan our next day's activities from our bedroom. We were so busy touring around the city we didn't get an opportunity to use the gym or the spa - both of which looked fab. The bar/lobby area is a haven of civilised tranquility with smooth music playing in the background to help you chillout that bit more. Staff are attentive without being fussy and a good selection of drinks and bar snacks are available. The barman mixes a mean mohito ! This hotel is full of nice little thoughtful touches to make people feel welcomed and cared for e.g. The Virtual Tuck In service - basically a couple of PCs with webcams to allow people to say goodnight to their children when they're away from home on business. Also the dog biscuits and water outside the front door for our furry friends. Next visit to Chicago I'll definitely be staying here and wouldn't even consider an alternative if The James can maintain these standards.",1,nan,ta_p227
trip_advisor,"took a weekend trip with my wife. got a great rate with valet included, paid a couple extra bucks for the larger room. staff was nice, workout facility was great. room has current decor, but was starting to show some wear. watch the concierge, she suggested a pretty bad restaurant to us.",1,nan,ta_p228
trip_advisor,"My significant other and I recently spent 3 nights at The James and on the last day I said, ""I wish we could stay longer"". That good! The room was immaculate and a very pleasant surprise from the moment you open the door. Everything is high tech. Plasma TV, CD/Radio, Projection alarm clock (love that so much bought one today). If you wanted room service you got it from David Burke and the mini bar and liquor selection was plentiful. They even have a four legged friend menu. The bathroom was pleasant with bathrobes/slippers and upscale products provided. The bed was the best in a hotel ever. Linens were crip, white and fresh. Maid service twice daily with turn down service. Safe in room, ice delivered, iron, hairdryer all top of the line. The filtered window shades blacked out the light and matched the modern decor. Mid-century style with funky chair/ottman, cubes and a table with nightstands gave us plenty of room and felt like comforts of home. The staff was courteous and accommodating. The library, free internet access, in room wifi were extras we didn't expect . Bar/lounge areas seems to be frequented by locals enjoying cocktails and appetizers in the lobby. Funky artwork. Location, location, location. The best place we've ever stayed not only in Chicago. Highly recommend.",1,nan,ta_p229
trip_advisor,"I believe I can not describe how amazing was our stay at The James. Service was impecable, from the door man to the front desk. Location could not be better. Yes, you can hear the ambulances in the street from the 14th floor, but, come on, you are downtown, what do you expect....Overall noise was not in a level to bother us. The only minor incident was a cleaner that tried to open our room to clean at 9 pm...PM not AM? Go figure...",1,nan,ta_p230
trip_advisor,"My husband and I wanted to spend the weekend in Chicago to celebrate our anniversary, and I had been looking at the James for awhile because it was attached to David Burke's Primehouse. From the moment I called to make my reservation, I knew this hotel understood what customer service means to a consumer and a picky one at that. From the pre-arrival dossier, to the special sweets from the staff to kick off our anniversary weekend and a hand written note thanking us for staying at the James, this staff is well versed in the long lost art of customer service. The rooms were well appointed and the beds comfy and warm on a cool weekend. The walking distance to Michigan Av is a huge plus. From the front desk to the cleaning staff, the staff here is top notch! And David Burke's Primehouse is not to be missed!",1,nan,ta_p231
trip_advisor,"I LOVED this hotel. The room was so chic and trendy, the bed was comfortable, great slippers and robes. I love the Keihl's bath products in the bathroom. We went during my birthday weekend, and they had a card and plate with pastries waiting in the room. We got a great deal on a junior suite from Travelzoo, but when we tried to take another trip to Chicago, the deal was gone. I really recommend the hotel. I LOVED it. The ONLY problem we had was with the David Burke Steakhouse. The service was horrible, they switched our order with the table next to our's and the only compensation was they took off a $7 side dish we ordered (and they were nice enough to NOT charge us for the other side dish we DIDN'T get). DON'T go there. Go to the Lawry's accross the street. But stay at the James. (BTW- its not a 3-star hotel like the website lists- its at least 4-star)",1,nan,ta_p232
trip_advisor,"The James Hotel met and exceeded our expectations. A haven of cool, uncluttered comfort in a hot, crowded but congenial city. Located within steps of some of the greatest art, architecture, culinary and cultural opportunities anywhere in North America, the staff of the James provided us with a home away from home for the week we visited. The check-in was quick and flawless and the king suite a calm, restorative oasis. It is difficult to over-praise the friendly, attentive staff; this is a hotel that truly has its act together! The day before our visit ended, we experienced problems with the room's air conditioner. When the technician was unable to quickly solve the problem, we were immediately upgraded to a one-bedroom apartment with stunning views of the Chicago skyline. We eagerly await the opening of new James Hotels in other cities.",1,nan,ta_p233
trip_advisor,"I stayed at the James in June, and I must say, it felt like I was in some ultra-swanky boutqiue hotel. From the uniforms of the staff.. which consists of a small J pin that they wear with nice suits and such, to the wonderful, comfortable beds, the James just makes you feel ultra-relaxed. The gym in the hotel was fantastic for a hotel gym, and the machines were all new and in fantastic condition. I really enjoyed the complimentary Kiehl's products as well as the soft, cushy beds with futons. Location-wise, it's just off Michigan ave, and it's close to all the shops and restaurants. I'd definitely stay here if I'm' ever back in Chicago.",1,nan,ta_p234
trip_advisor,"Stayed for 2 nights at The James, wonderful location 2 mins walk to Michigan Avenue with all the shops. Staff here were all incredibly helpful and genuinely friendly. Nothing was too much trouble. Rooms are huge and the beds the most comfortable I have slept in. Room was very clean, had separate seating area with sofa and chairs with a 42in flat screen tv. There was a bar area with stereo, mini bar and coffee maker. There was another flat screen tv in the bedroom area. Bathroom very good with complimentary shampoo, conditioner, shower gel and body lotion. Hotel is also ""pet friendly"". There was even a large bowl of iced water and a barrel of dog biscuits at the front door of the hotel !!!. Pets even had their own options on the room sevice menu.",1,nan,ta_p235
trip_advisor,I have stayed at many hotels traveling for both business and pleasure and I can honestly stay that The James is tops. The service at the hotel is first class. The rooms are modern and very comfortable. The location is perfect within walking distance to all of the great sights and restaurants. Highly recommend to both business travellers and couples.,1,nan,ta_p236
trip_advisor,"Just returned to Seattle after a visit home to Chicago and I loved The James!!! Recently stayed at the Ritz at Water Tower and the Dana around the corner--both of which were great but The James was perfect. Secured the room through a package w/ American Express for a great deal so though the view wasn't great the space, decor and location can't be beat. Staff was friendly, courteous and very helpful, the gym was substantial and though I didn't try the restaurants/room service, the menus looked yummy. I've stayed in Chgo in that area on avg 1-2s/mo over the past three years and the James is at the top my list now. If you can get a good deal, I highly recommend!!",1,nan,ta_p237
trip_advisor,"The thing that makes this such an enjoyable place to stay is the staff who were all excellent and polite and the service was impeccable. The room was very clean, the beds were comfortable but it was a little small and the water in the bathroom was not very hot. Other than that it was a great place to stay.",1,nan,ta_p238
trip_advisor,"I try to stay at the James every time I happen to be in Chicago. There are other good choices in town, but nobody has what the James offers: superior service - aka class meets efficiency -, metropolitan design and comfort with an attention to details I found only at the W in Seoul, and what always plays a role meaning a convenient location ... Then they get to you with small unexpected touches that make the difference ie: I was about to take off and drive North, it was a hot July day...one of the staff members handed me a bottle of water. A small gesture. Unexpected and appreciated. The management AND the staff understand what we expect and more importantly, what we need. AND they consistenly execute against that.",1,nan,ta_p239
trip_advisor,"I was very happy with my stay at the Knickerbocker. The room were nice, and the staff was excellent. I was able to stay here for $80 per night thru Priceline. That was an incredible bargain in my opinion .. this hotel is very nice. It has an excellent location ... just off of Michigan Ave. All of the best shopping in Chicago can be found right around the corner. It's a great location ... very close to many great attractions. If there is any negative it would be that there is no swimming pool, but I think that is common with a lot of the older hotels in Chicago, I would definately recommend this place ... hopefully I will be able to stay there again in the future.",1,nan,ta_p240
trip_advisor,"My first trip back to Chicago in about 7 years was perfect! I chose the Knickerbocker as I had read that their rooms were recently renovated on top of being a great location to Michigan Avenue, Rush Street and downtown Chicago. I must say I was very impressed with the guestrooms! I had not stayed there prior but it definitely is a refresh from what I've seen in photo's posted on the reviews. The guestrooms are nicely decorated with a modern feel and they are good sized for a historical hotel! The beds are wonderful -- I need to get a pillow top mattress at home! I used the Internet access with no issue and I LOVED the larger screen TV's. The shower is fun with the different types of shower heads you can choose. And the bathrooms are fresh with all new granite and tile. I'm anxious to get back to Chicago and it won't be 7 years from now! I would highly recommend this hotel -- fantastic guestrooms, location and staff! I've added some digital pictures of my room as they are completely different from the one's I saw on previous reviews with the new renovation.",1,nan,ta_p241
trip_advisor,"We absolutely loved the Knickerbocker. Now, if you expect your hotels to be cookie cutter comfortable, forget this place. If Holiday Inns are like the rows of housing developments in the suburbs, the Knickerbocker is like those beautiful old houses in the center of the city. The location is great, the hotel bar is cozy and classy, and the rooms feel like guest bedrooms in Victorian mansions. For the price, you simply can't do any better than this in downtown Chicago.",1,nan,ta_p242
trip_advisor,"Other reviews complain about the small rooms. For a major city, we found our room quite comfortable with a king bed and really nice furnishings. One feature we liked is the ability to open the window. The Knikerbocker is a small boutique hotel right off Michigan Avenue in the best area of Chicago. The staff was friendly and helpful. For the $116 we paid on Hotwire, we could not have found a better room in downtown Chicago.",1,nan,ta_p243
trip_advisor,"We were greeted by staff with excellent customer service skills. Our room was such a pleasant surprise, from the flat screen TV, the full size shower with rain showerhead & hand held shower wand, the wall attached toilet with flushing options (on the wall), the comfortable bed, the lovely lighting options, etc.. The size of the room was snug, and very comfortable, as would be, in a historic hotel. It was also quiet, and I know that the hotel was sold out. My sister was in the room next door. We did not hear her TV. We also loved walking less than a block, to the shopping and restaurants on North Michigan Avenue.",1,nan,ta_p244
trip_advisor,"We stayed here as an alternative spot for a friend's wedding. The price was about 50% to 65% of what it costs to stay at similar hotels in the area. First the minuses. 1.) The standard rooms are small. if you want a little more space you might want to upgrade. 2.) Since the hotel has been recently rehabbed you can see some of the stuff that the covered or painted. 3.) There really are no views from the hotel. Now the plusses. 1.) The shower is AWESOME. Probably one of the best hotel showers I've seen. Rain shower with wand, great pressure and the enclosure didn't leak like a lot of these shower stalls do. Very nice. 2.) The fixtures and finishes in the rooms were top notch. Very modern and clean. 3.) The bed was great. Better than some hotels that promote their beds. Great nights sleep. Overall. This is a great space for a trip where you are not going to be spending much time in the room. If you were in town for a conference or for work where you will need to spread out your stuff it might not work. Anyone else should really like the experience. All I care about when I travel is having a nice bed and a good shower to relax in after a long day. If you are the same this is a good spot for you.",1,nan,ta_p245
trip_advisor,We stayed 2 nights at the Knickerbocker and could not have had a better stay. The hotel has recently renovated there rooms. The staff could not have been more friendly and helpful from Dave and Cora at the martini bar to Julie at the front desk who help out with an upgrade for us. The hotel has everything you need for your stay and is close to all the fun that Chicago offers. Our pick for THE CITY is the Knickerbocker. JOHN and JUDY.,1,nan,ta_p246
trip_advisor,"The Knickerbocker hotel is fantastic! It's an old hotel with updated rooms - so you get the old-timey charm and fresh comfort all at once. The hotel has a fabulous location. It's a one minute walk to the Cheesecake Factory and Bloomingdales, and about a 5 minute walk to Einstein Bagel Company (the best bagels and cream cheese EVER), Macys and Saks. This location can't be beat. You're at one end of the magnificent mile, so it makes for easy strolling, as you don't start in the middle and then backtrack. The hotel staff are super helpful and friendly. Checking in and out was very smooth, and the concierge (Cheryl) was amazing. She booked all our dinner reservations and activities for us, and recommended an incredible restaurant called Carmines which was a 5 minute walk. It was the greatest italian restaurant I have ever been to, and I can't recommend it more. The rooms are small but not too small. We had a beautiful big samsung flat screen, cordless phones, a rain shower, ample clean towels, and beautiful marble countertops. The hotel rooms have european charm to them and made me feel like I was at a 5 star hotel in Europe. The beds are very comfortable and the duvet is soft like butter. The only complaint I had was that housekeeping woke us up at 8:30 one morning when the knocked on our door despite the fact that we had the do not disturb sign on. When we answered and asked her to come back later she seemed a bit miffed. The issue was corrected, though, and it didn't happen again during our 4 night stay. The hotel has some unique items on their room service menu - ie - grilled cheese with mini tomato soup for dipping. Very cute. Their late night menu, however, is lacking. It would have been nice to see some soup on there. That being said, I RARELY order from room service when on vacation, so I really don't see that being a big deal. Overall I would recommend this hotel without hesitation. I think we paid about 130 a night and I would say it was worth far more than that. We had a wonderful experience and I truly look forward to staying there again....wouldn't stay anywhere else!",1,nan,ta_p247
trip_advisor,"Just got back from three nights at the Knickerbocker. Went up to Chicago for some last minute Christmas shopping. Hotel is in a great location. North end of Michigan Ave. about half a block away. Staff was very nice and professional. Everyone we came in contact with was very helpful. Granted this is a older hotel and some of the rooms are no bigger than closets. We were booked into a standard room and when we arrived we upgraded to a deluxe room. Good size room, with nice furnishings and a comfortable bed. Bathroom was somewhat small. Housekeeping did a great job cleaning the room every day. Did not eat at the restaurant Nix, but saw several people getting orders delivered to the bar. Overheard comments saying the food was very good. Drink service at the Martini Bar can be slow. Martinis run $9 and up. Very good drinks and they don't shy away from the liquor. Valet parking was $35 a day with in/out priviliges. Overall a great stay.

In an e-mail I received before we left for Chicago, the concierge, Les, offered to get us tickets, directions, reservations to anything we'd like to see/do. He also got us an upgrade on our room, and when someone rudely butted in line as we were registering, the registry person said they would upgrade our room just for that. And so we were granted a beautiful suite complete with king size bed and jacuzzi. The bed and the linens were so comfortably both of us slept late every morning!",1,nan,ta_p252

We have stayed (and enjoyed) at the Drake, Intercontinental and others, but we always now come back to the Knickerbocker. Why? If ""Charlie"" the doorman is on duty and you pull up, he will welcome you. He'll probably ask your name. Why? Because he wants to call you by your name every time he will see you during your visit. Somehow he even lets the other employees know your name and all of a sudden, doorman, receptionist, bellman, waiter are referring to you by name. The employees are what makes this hotel. Yes, it has everything to offer like all hotels, but the others don't have the fine people (including the cleaning staff) these folks have. Try it, you will like it. We look forward to our next visit already...",1,nan,ta_p253
trip_advisor,"I love this hotel. It is one of the best that I have stayed in. The lobby was beautiful and the room was nice and comfortable. The made services was terrific. No matter what time we left the room it was made up when we came back. I asked the maid for a couple of extras and she was very nice and friendly. That is what I liked about the hotel the staff was so nice and friendly. I was there with my daughter for a girl's weekend from Thursday - Sunday. Everyone from the doorman to the concierge to the people at the desk etc. was wonderful. I can't say enough good about this hotel. Yes the bathroom was small, but I wasn't moving into the room. I was just staying there a few days and was hardly in the room anyway. I will definitely stay there again",1,nan,ta_p254
trip_advisor,"We really enjoyed our brief stay at the Millennium Knickerbocker! From the front desk personnel and bellmen to the housekeeping staff and bartender, everyone we met was helpful and welcoming. Our 11th-floor room was clean and beautiful, and the view looking north to the Drake Hotel and apartments across the street was nice. The in-room coffee service was appreciated, too. There isn't a lot of room in the bathroom for your toiletries, but I'd still take a room in a beautiful older hotel with character over a spacious-but-cookie-cutter room any day!",1,nan,ta_p255
trip_advisor,"OK, we are back from the Knickerbocker and I would give it the best rating. I can't believe the bad reviews. I got a priceline deal, and I still got a fine room, clean, up-to-date furnishings (OK a little traditional for my taste) and smoke free. Someone said in another thread that some people write prank reviews. I think such people should get a life because people want to read the truth. Here it is from my point of view. Both rooms on 10th floor. Regarding the size of the rooms. We had two rooms. One was a 2 double bed room. It was about 20' x 15'. Each double bed had valences that were kind of mini-canopies. The furniture, bathroom tile, shower (no tub), wall paper and paint had been done in the last few years. A Chinese inspired cabinet held TV, coffeemaker, ice bucket, and mini-bar. Three separate levels (TV, ice/coffee, and minibar) The other room was called ""Queen executive"". This one had queen bed with more of a canopy than valence, sofabed, two TVs and terry bathrobes. Also about the same size but different configerations. One TV faced the bed, other in the three level cabinet, the sofabed. Smoke in the lobby. There is a bar to the right of the entrance. It is an open arrangement so that I am sure the smoke comes from bar to entrance door. No smoke smell in no-smoking rooms. Cost of rooms $75 on priceline plus taxes. Very good value one block from N. Michigan Ave. Only complaint. Concierge said that the free trolley didn't go down Michigan Ave to Field Museum/Museum complex when in fact it does. Was this ignorance? or trying to throw more business to taxi? Either case, not good. He said at this time of year free trolley only goes to Navy Pier during winter....which is clearly incorrect.",1,nan,ta_p256
trip_advisor,"My wife and I had to stay downtown for event that we were attending at the Drake Hotel. I have stayed at the Drake before and while it is nice, it is bit stuffy and a little outdated for the price. We opted to walk across the street and stay at the Millenium instead. I know this property has under gone many renovations in past year and I have to say they have done a great job. This place used to be the hotel you would crash in when you came to Chicago on a college roadtrip (I did). But that is not the case any more. This property is directly across from the Drake Hotel and for 1/2 the price you get their great location with a newer (albeit smaller) room and every ammenity you would expect from a 4* hotel. The rooms are tastefully decorated (Asian influence w/flat screen tv) and the bed is very comfortable. The bath is small (no tub), but very clean and the shower is great. You are not going to be spending a bunch of time in your room when visting Chicago, so the room's size is not a big deal. (It works well with a couple, but a family of four may be a bit cramped.) The service was attentive and friendly and the location can't be beat. I would definitely stay here again, but the next time I would leave the car at home ($49/night parking is a bit steep).",1,nan,ta_p257
trip_advisor,"I loved this hotel - fabulous old building but with first class modern amenities. Great location, as it's so close to both lakeshore and city. Chicago is such a walkable city, so this was a superb base. The staff were just lovely - so very friendly and efficient. The room was wonderful - very, very comfortable and exceptionally clean. Great chair. Great coffee. Lovely bathroom with a huge, absolutely fantastic shower. It was also extremely quiet. That, and the best bed ever, meant I slept so well and since I was there for a week, that was very important to me. Yummy martinis at the Martini Bar. I will most definitley be back!",1,nan,ta_p258

From check in to check out the hotel staff was extremely helpful and friendly. The rooms are small but cozy. After reading the reviews from other guests I was somewhat scared of what I would find - they must have stayed at a different hotel. I am a very frequent traveler and felt that the rooms and the hotel met the ""4 star"" rating. Yes, the rooms and bathrooms were small, but what historic hotel in a big city isn't? The decor and quality met my expectations. The lobby and bar were very inviting. Overall, I would stay here again and again.",1,nan,ta_p259
trip_advisor,"This is a great hotel! From the doorman who greeted us as we arrived, to the young man at the reservation desk to the young woman serving complimentarily wine, everyone was very friendly and helpful. We were ""strangers but for a minute!"" The room was extremely clean, well appointed and we had a pretty view of the Chicago River, especially enjoyed from the large window seats. Loved the purple polka-dot paper on the toilet paper roll! Hallways were large and quiet. The restaurant next door, South Water Kitchen is very nice too. The location is in walking distance of the theatres, parks, the river (take a cruise), Michigan Ave. It's ideal. The only negative is that the concierges were not nearly as friendly or inviting as the rest of the staff nor were they very helpful. For a self-sufficient traveler, you wouldn't really need their services (although it is nice) but for someone coming to Chicago for the first time, a concierge can be very helpful. I would definately stay at this hotel again and would recommend it.",1,nan,ta_p260
trip_advisor,"Hotel Monaco is in a really great location, only a block away from the Miracle mile and a couple of blocks from Millenium Park. Sears Tower is also well within walking distance and if you don't mind walking you won't have a problem walking to Greek Town and Lincoln Park (we did). The daily, complimentary, wine hour is a really nice touch that we unfortunately were only around once to try out. If you can, leave your car behind, you won't need it and the parking is quite pricey, which is not very surprising considering the location. Everything was clean, fresh and modern and the staff very helpful. The only bad thing was that the noise from the elevated train around ""the loop"" was quite loud and that our room happened to be next to the maid's supply room so it was quite busy in the morning.",1,nan,ta_p261
trip_advisor,"I can only confirm the positve reviews previously mentioned. We stayed in room 1112, King with River View. No noise and very comfortable.The price was a bargain at $191 a night. I would stay here again. The ""L"" from Midway Airport lets you off about two blocks from the Hotel. It's a $2 ride - no need for a $40 taxi ride.",1,nan,ta_p262
trip_advisor,"This was my first time in Chicago and wanted a hotel that was in a good location. This definitely fit the bill. I could walk to all the places I wanted to see - very close to Michigan Ave and the Magnificent Mile. About a 15 minute walk to the Art Institute. The hotel staff was very friendly and went out of their way to be helpful. There was coffee in the lobby every morning, that was very welcome. The room was comfortable and clean and fairly quiet. I could hear the train and some traffic from the street (considering the location, this wasn't bad and didn't affect my ability to sleep or relax). I would definitely recommend this hotel - a gem!!",1,nan,ta_p263
trip_advisor,"My initial thought of the hotel was, this place is just ok, I didnt look up any reviews as I was staying there with 2 other friends. I was truly impressed from ceiling to floor with the room. Views were good, its just the surrounding buildings unless your towards the front where the river is located. I'm crazy about huge bathrooms and this one is HUGE. I love all the space they have. Flat tv, traditional seating and I admired the fabric-based headboards. Those are very nice! Walking distance to restaurants were convenient. I'm a highly frequent traveler to Chicago almost 20 years now and always stay with relatives. In any event, I'd recommend staying at the Monaco again!",1,nan,ta_p264
trip_advisor,"We wanted a nice place to stay the night after dinner, theater, and my daughter's 21st birthday. This place certainly fit the bill. It was convenient to everything including the SouthShore Railroad station. The staff were all friendly. Their was a small wine reception in the lobby in the evening and Starbucks coffee in the morning. Ryan, the concierge, ordered flowers for my daughter and had a nice bowl of Hershey Kisses waiting for us when we arrived. We were upgraded to a suite and although they forgot to make up the sofa bed, they came promptly to get it set up when we called later. The window seats were beautiful as well and I enjoyed drinking my coffee in the morning and reading a book.",1,nan,ta_p265
trip_advisor,"Stayed at the Monaco on my way skiing at Easter & loved it. Staff were helpful & friendly, room was huge with fantastic view of the river. Central location, 5 min walk to the EL. Adjoining Restaurant/Bar, great food & service. I have stayed in more expensive, supposedly better, hotels in Chicago, but this is the best. Thanks Monaco, I'll be back.",1,nan,ta_p266
trip_advisor,"Having had a great stay at the Monaco last Fall with friends, I was disappointed (initially) to arrive on Saturday with husband and find that they didn't have our Quikbook made reservation in their system and they had no rooms available for Sat. eve. BUT they immediately took responsibility for their mistake by doing the following: found us a nice room at the neighboring Swissotel and paid for it! Gave us cab fare to get the 4 blocks over there. Paid for our valet parking $33 that eve. So naturally when they asked if we were interested in returning for Sunday eve (when they did have room), we said yes. When we returned, they gave us a corner suite with jacuzzi tub for our $139 quikbook rate! Now that's what I call a recovery!!",1,nan,ta_p267
trip_advisor,"We had a king deluxe room for 2 nights. We reserved the room through the hotel website with AAA discount. We paid $180/nt. We enjoy boutique hotels, as they have so much more personality and personal service. This hotel was no exception. Every employee we encountered was pleasant and helpful. The room was clean, well decorated, spacious and quiet. We were offered at check-in a room with a view, but warned it was across from the elevator, so we decided to take the quiet, large room with no view. The location of the hotel was perfect for us, we saw Wicked while in Chicago and had no problem walking to the theater. We also walked the Magnificient Mile and found the location perfect (we like to walk). We had drinks at the hotel restaurant both nights which was a pleasurable experience. We ate room service for breakfast each morning, and the food was good and the portions were quite large. We would definitely stay here again.",1,nan,ta_p268
trip_advisor,"After reading the reviews on this hotel, I decided to book my stay for July 4th weekend here and I am glad I did, this hotel is absolutely beautiful. Our suite was gorgeous it is a very romantic hotel with big sit in picture windows. I do have 1 complaint. The bar is very boring and the resturant is not that great, but other than that I loved it. I would definitely stay there again.",1,nan,ta_p269
trip_advisor,"Stayed here with friends for a long weekend in August and loved the hotel. Enjoyed the free nightly wine happy hour, and the accomodations were quite nice (our beds were very soft and comfortable). We had excellent views of the river from our rooms. The location was wonderful for seeing the sights around town, with easy access to public transportation nearby. My friends actually received the goldfish upon request, which they enjoyed. Some noise could be heard from rooms nearby or above, but it was minimal. Price seemed very resonable to us for the location. Will certainly return to the Windy City and plan on staying here again.",1,nan,ta_p270
trip_advisor,"Our room was on the third floor so there was some street noise - but it certainly didn't spoil our 4 nights in this lovely hotel. Wine tasting evening went down extremely well after a day seeing the sights of the city!! Our goldish was called Oliver - nobody could believe we had our very own goldfish in our room!! All the staff were really helpful and welcoming, making our stay here very relaxing and comfortable. Would certainly recommend this hotel.",1,nan,ta_p271
trip_advisor,"Very pleasant front staff, wine in the evening in the lobby, large rooms, great rates, and free Internet for those that are members of the loyalty program. Overall an excellent value. Close to the El for those coming in from either Midway or O'Hare airports.",1,nan,ta_p272
trip_advisor,"Stayed at the Monaco for a romantic weekend getaway and it was simply fantastic. Very convenient for walking to museums, shopping and park nearby. The room has a great box window that you can sit in and enjoy the view. We also requested a goldfish which was a pleasant surprise and added to the charm and uniqueness of the hotel. Helpful staff, wifi, Aveda products, decent restaurant downstairs for brunch, easy to get a taxi and nothing beats the location. I would definitely recommend staying at this hotel, for business or pleasure.",1,nan,ta_p273
trip_advisor,"After reading so many great reviews I booked the Hotel Monaco and was not disappointed. I booked through their web site about 2 1/2 months prior to arrival for $170/night plus tax for a room with 2 queens. The location was perfect - right by the river near Michigan Ave. - minutes walk to the El, Millenium Park, the Theater District and Shopping. The room was clean, a little larger than standard and nicely decorated. We had window seats in the room with a view of the river. There was Starbucks coffee in the lobby in the morning and a wine reception in the evening. To top it off, the staff was very friendly and knowledgable about the area.",1,nan,ta_p274
trip_advisor,A friend highly recommended this hotel and we couldn't have been happier! It was wonderful ~ my husband and kids were already planning our next trip there before we had even left the hotel. The kids loved the goldfish in the room and thought the window seats were the best.,1,nan,ta_p275
trip_advisor,"I want to recognize so many people who were exemplary in their service. 1) Sylvia Rollins, Head Concierge. I wanted a fairly last minute reservation at MK restaurant. I spoke with Sylvia on the phone just a few days prior to arrival and within 15 minutes had the desired reservation. 2) Ryan Lettier, Concierge, provided us detailed information on the architectural cruises. Our morning cruise ended up being cancelled by the tour operator and Ryan provided a late check out time to cover us until we could get back to the Monaco. 3) Turndown service was provided as requested and housekeeping in general seemed to be at a high standard 4) Even the bellman went out of their way to ask if we knew how to get the train etc when leaving the hotel. The rooms are tastfully furnished in that whimiscal Hotel Monaco feel. Beds and bedding both very comfortable. The complimentary happy hour and morning coffee/tea service were both very utililzed by the hotel guests.",1,nan,ta_p276
trip_advisor,"My husband and I stayed at the Hotel Monaco for 5 days in October, 2007. I cannot begain to tell you how great this place is. The service was impecable and the room was fantastic. Huge window seat to look over Chicago. It was great. The wine reception in the evening was a special treat as was the morning coffee service in the lobby. This was our first trip to Chicago and I hope not our last. I will definately stay at Hotel Monaco again when we return. We booked our room through a safety convention web site.",1,nan,ta_p277
trip_advisor,"While I had stayed in the Hotel Monaco before, this was my husband's first trip to Chicago and I insisted we stay here as I loved it the first time. Well the second stay was even better -- we had one of the corner suites on the river -- the service was excellent and staff was very friendly and helpful. The warm cookies in the afternoon is a nice touch after a day of sightseeing. Unfortunately we missed the wine hour. One thing that realy impressed me is that b/c of flight delays we got to Chicago a day late -- Hotel Monaco manager waived the cost of the first night on our room even though it was a guaranteed reservation.",1,nan,ta_p278
trip_advisor,"We loved this hotel and would definitely come back. Initially we weren't given a goldfish, which was disappointing, but then we left a tip for the housekeeper, and she rewarded us with one. We had fun sipping wine and playing Wii in the lobby every afternoon. The staff were quite friendly and helpful, even printing our boarding passes for us. Our room was very comfortable, with a cozy little alcove at the window where we read the paper. At first we were worried about noise, since our room was next to the elevator, but we hardly heard it, and didn't notice any street noise either. The hotel is colorfully and tastefully decorated, well-lit, and ideally located.",1,nan,ta_p279
trip_advisor,We stayed at the Omni between Christmas and New Year's in 2008 just to get away for a few days. We found it through web deals and got a penthouse suite very cheap. So this year we checked online just a day or so after Christmas and the deal was there again. It also included parking at the great price. Huge suite overlooking downtown Chicago. Best location to walk EVERYWHERE. My 12 and 11 yr olds loved swimming at night and the chocolate cookies on their pillows. Can't wait to go back.,1,nan,ta_p280
trip_advisor,"Just back from 5 night stay at Omni and would thoroughly recommend it. Staff bent over backwards to assist in anything, no matter how minute. Great location on magnificent mile and lots to do there both for adults and my 10yo daughter. If i had to find a fault it would be the extra charges, taxes etc for room service, bar and restaurant, but where is cheap these days? Would definitely recommend it, especially for families.",1,nan,ta_p281
trip_advisor,"I stayed at the Omni for one night following a business meeting at another downtown Chicago hotel. I was completely impressed by the service; all personnel during my stay were absolutely outstanding. I checked in quite early (no problem) and was efficiently checked in. My room had a somewhat heavy scent of air freshener (the ONLY negative from the entire stay), which was managed reasonably well by opening the windows. I don't generally require much during my hotel stays, but suffice to say the doorman, housekeeping, the night manager and bartender at 676, the day waiter at 676, and the concierge were amazing - I never waited more than about 30 seconds for anything. The room was very comfy and the amenities were superior. One very tiny complaint - there was no wastebasket near the sink or near the wet bar - had to walk to the other end of the bathroom or sitting room to dispose of kleenex/coffee paraphernalia. One wastebasket would make all the difference. All that said - what a great hotel!! Thanks, Omni - I had a great stay!",1,nan,ta_p282
trip_advisor,"My husband and I had a wonderful stay at the Omni Chicago Hotel. I had contacted the customer service representative prior to our stay to request a quiet suite. When we arrived, she greeted us and confirmed that we were getting exactly what I had requested--and more. Our suite had a partial view of the lake!!! And, we were able to check in early. The service at this hotel is incredible. Everyone made us feel welcome and took care to respond to any question or request that we had. The suite was very quiet even though we were on the east side of the hotel, very near to Michigan Avenue. Housekeeping was prompt and thorough. We really couldn't have asked for a better hotel. We will definitely stay there on future trips to Chicago and will recommend this hotel to anyone who travels there.",1,nan,ta_p283
trip_advisor,"We stayed at Omni Chicago for 2 nights in early July (July 1-3). The reason we chose this hotel was simply because of a great deal we got on TravelZoo. We got pretty good rate that included a valet parking and vouchers for food&beverages. I also signed up for their loyalty program, which was so worth it. I was concerned at first that we would be treated like a second-class guest because of the price we paid. But I was totally wrong! They treated us extremely well. Before our arrival, I got an email asking if we needed anything. So, I asked for a fridge to store the baby milk. And they arranged it for us without charge :) We arrived late on Thursday night. Our room was ready for us upon our arrival with the fridge I requested. We were given a corner suite on the 10th floor...very nice room...comfy bed. My husband was really wowwwww!!! The bed was made ready for us - both in the bedroom and the sofa-bed (we didn't use the sofa-bed though). We got a high-speed Internet as part of the loyalty program. All staff were friendly and helpful...front desk, valet parking, bell boy, room service, concierge,... everyone! We used the voucher for room-service breakfasts both morning. The first day was great. Food was great, and quick. We also got complimentary beverages as part of the loyalty program. We ordered OJ and hot chocolate. They both were so good that we ordered them again the next morning. But we were very disappointed that the hot chocolate tasted pretty horrible. It tasted like left-over coffee mixed with water and a bit of chocolate :( Also, we ordered Belgian waffle for our breakfast, which was supposed to come with whipped cream and strawberries...but we got a plain waffle. So, we had to call the restaurant and wait for a while to get those. This is why I didn't give ""5"" for service. However, I reported these issues to the front-desk when checking out, and the front-desk staff took care of it by not charging us for that meal. Another thing is that it's quite noisy at night even though we were on the high floor. We could hear siren going on & off during the night. But this is out of the hotel's control though. And I would say that it didn't bother us at all. My baby could sleep very well. Overall, we really enjoyed our stay, and would definitely consider Omni for our next trip to Chicago.",1,nan,ta_p284
trip_advisor,"Great hotel in heart of Chicago for business or pleasure. Rooms are recently upgraded and very modern and large. Flat screen TVs, marble baths, all rooms are suites, great desk, kitchenette, comfortable bed, free wireless internet... everything you could ask for. Location is easy walk to Magnificient Mile and lots of great restaurants. Staff is friendly and helpful. Short cab ride to Loop.",1,nan,ta_p285
trip_advisor,"At the last minute, my son and I decided to take a quick trip to Chicago to see the Cubs. After checking Priceline I decided to book the Omni because of the great price for airfare and hotel. We arrived at the hotel around noon and our room was ready(I had called ahead and requested early arrival).The front desk treated us like we were there best customers-very friendly and accomodating. The room was wonderful with all the modern conviences you would expect in an upscale hotel. The room was spotless and the bed was VERY comfortable. There was not one sign of bed bugs as mentioned in a previous review-maybe those bed bugs were from their luggage and were transferred into their room!!!We then went to the hotel restaurant and had lunch. Our service was great as was the food. We also tried several restaurants around the Omni-all within walking distance. The service, cleanliness and location of the Omni were incredible. We will definitely go back.",1,nan,ta_p286
trip_advisor,"I'll keep it short. My wife, daughter and I stayed at this hotel for 3 nights. We go on several vacations a year and this was a great hotel. Location: It is located in the center of the Magnificent Mile (Michigan Ave.), so it is near or easily accessible to everything you might want to do. Hotel: The hotel itself is very clean, as were the rooms. Maid service was excellent, including 2x daily cleaning and turndown service (I think they missed a night). Service: Every staff member we encountered was super friendly and kind. They always have someone at the lobby door greeting you with a smile. Every night we had milk and cookies waiting in our room (sometimes chocolates on our pillows). They always pushed the elevator button for you if they were near it. There was no shortage of people to ask things. My only conplaint was that the congierge was tough to get. They shouuld have more than one, or longer hours. Other: We had breakfast in the 676 Restaurant and it was very good, and well attended, appointed. They even carried my wifes plate to the table from the buffet. The pool was a nice addition and a hit with the kids. It was nice to go for a swim after a long day of walking. Pool and changing areas were spotless. Room: Clean, sunny and spacious. Probably over 400 sq. ft. - 2 TVs, couch, desk, chairs - all in perfect shape. The windows open for some fresh air. Pillows were pretty comfortable. With all aspects considered, I think this was an unbeatable value! I would not hesitate to stay again or recommend it to a friend. I truly have nothing negative to say about the hotel. It was a wonderful stay and we will miss being there. Omni has hit the right formula to make a guest feel like a welcomed person as opposed to just a nuisance or a number. The airlines have cornered the market on that.",1,nan,ta_p287
trip_advisor,"We arrived at the Omni on 2nd September for a 6 day stay. I took ill when I left the plane after travelling from Manchester so I saw more of the room than I anticipated. I couldn't go out for 4 days. The room was spacious and clean. The bed was extremely comfortable. The bathroom was large and very clean. What more could you ask. We had coffee and juice left outside our door every morning at the time we requested. I managed to go to the 5th floor to see the sun terrace (outside the gym) Having a sun terrace in a city hotel is a great idea but the terrace was a bit grim. A few sunbeds on a concrete floor. There was also noise from an air conditioning unit. It could do with a bit of cheering up. What I saw of Chicago was very pleasing, it has something for everyone. Would I go back to the Omni? yes I would.",1,nan,ta_p288
trip_advisor,"We have stayed at several high end places in Chicago and this is still our favorite. Location is superb, staff are particularly gracious and welcoming without being cloying. Cornell, at the front desk, is unfailingly helpful as is the concierge. We love the extra room that a suite provides and if you join the frequent guest program, high speed internet is gratis, as is a breakfast beverage delivered along with the newspaper each morning at the time of your choosing. Bedding is of excellent quality and they offer truly amazing blackout curtains! We have never had a bad stay at this hotel.",1,nan,ta_p289

I did so because I saw a $129.00 rate that included $25.00 of free food on Travelzoo. The three of us (55 year olds) all stayed in one suite with 2 double beds and a VERY comfortable pull out sofa. We had plenty of room. Food in the restaurant was great, service was outstanding from everone we came into contact with, early morning delivery of free coffee, juice and hot chocolate was fabulous and recommendations from the staff on where to eat, time of movies, shopping areas, etc was really helpful. Need I mention the outstanding location? Simply the best! We all decided that the Omni is our new favorite hotel.",1,nan,ta_p293
trip_advisor,"We just returned from our first trip to Chicago and stayed at the Omni. I read many reviews on trip advisor and picked the Omni based on its wonderful reviews and they were right on. The location, staff, rooms, amenities, etc were all wonderful. Huge thank you to TA members who suggested signing up for the preferred member program. We did that before we left and received complimentary beverages in the morning and newspapers among other perks. I loved being woken up to fresh orange juice and the Chicago Tribune newspaper. We were in room 816 which was perfect. Corner suite with two out of the 3 sides of the rooms being windows with a great view. The room was huge with a gorgeous king bed and great living area with plasma TV. The bathroom amenities were wonderful. I loved soaking in the tub with the mineral salts that were provided. The turn down service was great as well. We would come back to our room with relaxing music playing and our bed ready for us. We ate at their restaurant twice and the breakfast buffet was delicious. The blueberry muffins were the best I have ever had. Everything was so fresh and prepared perfectly. The staff at the Omni is so accomodating. Everyone is always smiling and asking you how your stay is. Have to thank the concierge Melissa and Curtis. They were both so helpful with great dining suggestions and maps for everything we wanted to do. I also used the gym during my stay and it was great. All the machines were top notch and each treadmill has a lcd TV attached. And the gym itself had two plasmas. They also had cold lemon water for you after your workout. I am a stickler for cleanliness and it was sparkling every morning. It really was a fantastic stay at the Omni and we would never stay anywhere else. I also wanted to mention we never heard any construction while we were there. Everything was quiet and we both slept wonderfully on the big comfy bed. Thank you Trip Advisor for another great trip suggestion!",1,nan,ta_p294

The room I had was on the 23rd floor and was like a suite, with a living area and a bedroom. The living room was spacious, with a plasma TV, a desk and a couch. The beds were very comfortable and the toiletries of very good quality. In the closed they placed an umbrella, which came in handy, it rained the whole time I was in Chicago. The internet connection is $9.95/24hrs. Great place, I will return for sure.",1,nan,ta_p296

Within just blocks are all types of stores, including Saks, Nordstroms, H&M, Filenes Basement, Macys, La Perla, Apple, Bloomingdates.....I could go on and on! The room itself was fabulous. Comfortable, nice big flat screen tvs, nice sized bathroom. They charge for Wi-Fi, but we found if we clicked yes on joining their guest program we could then go from the sign-on screen right to our email without actually completing the registration.

While this address in Chicago requires a high level of quality, the Omni delivers. Check in for myself and a whole group of people with me was under 3 minutes, the staff had plentiful recommendations for dining and events, and the rooms are some of the largest you'll find at this price range in Chicago. Even the ""standard"" room has a separate living area and work desk. The fitness center has free weights, weight machines, and two rows of cardio equipment. I shared the room with 7 others and did not feel cramped in any way! All in all, a great property!",1,nan,ta_p299

Staff were friendly. Would recommend it as a base to tour the city.",1,nan,ta_p300

No troubles with checkin. Very small room but bed was clean and comfortable. Starbucks in the lobby was a godsend. I'd read horror stories about the staff but they seemed friendly enough. For $70, it's a steal. For its online face value, not so much. Will definitely return if can get similar price.",1,nan,ta_p301

Location is great, kids loved the pool as a place to wind down after a day of museums, touring, ball games, etc. We checked in through Hilton Honors Desk as opposed to the regular check in line. Even though our reservations were through priceline at a reduced rate, they gave us a pick of the the rooms. The room had a large closet which helped with the amount of gear we had with us. Used valet parking which was hasselfree. We had a great experience and would stay there again.",1,nan,ta_p303
trip_advisor,My wife and I stayed for 2 nights and loved it. Our stay was booked for us by Virgin Atlantic when we booked our flights from London to Chicago. We were not quite sure what to expect but were reassured by the Hilton brand name. In the event we found that the airline knew what they were doing when they suggested this hotel. On arrrival we got a warm welcome and the check in was quick and efficient. The interior of the hotel is spectacular and looks like has been refurbished to reflect the decor as it would have been when it was built. The room we were given was a good size with 1 Queen bed which was particularly comfortable. The hotel is conveniently located with restaurants nearby. The first night we ate at the hotel's own gourmet restaurant (The Lockwood) which did not disappoint. The breakfasts are also served in this restaurant. We had the buffet both mornings and these were good value for the quality offered. Generally we found the service in this hotel good and the staff very helpful. A nice touch was that when we checked out of the hotel to go to our next destination the car we had booked to pick us up was a few minutes late arriving. A member of staff supervising the doormen saw us looking a bit lost and came over to assist us find the car when it did arrive. Overall I would thoroughly recommend this hotel for both business and leisure stays for both quality and value for money.,1,nan,ta_p304
trip_advisor,My wife and I redeemed some of my Hilton Reward Points to stay a few nights at the Palmer House. The hotel is absolutely beautiful. From the moment you walk into the lobby you can tell that this place is nice. As we were Diamond members we got upgraded to a suite which was great because we were provided access to their executive lounge (free food & drinks). The service was excellent and the location of the hotel is within walking distance of many sights on the south side of Chicago. I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone interested in coming to Chicago.,1,nan,ta_p305
trip_advisor,"We stayed at the Palmer House Hilton in early December, we stay there that weekend every December and we think it is the best location in the city for us. We like State Street better than Michigan Avenue and the Palmer House is right there. We stayed in the Towers, in a room with two double beds and 2 baths. The room was not huge, but very comfortable. The towers area was recently refurbished and it shows, the lobby is beautiful with plasma screen TVs on the walls, comfortable chairs and tables and a seperate room for the food/drinks. There is a continental breakfast in the morning, appetizers during cocktail hour and cookies are laid out until the room closes. There is a fridge stocked with soft drinks, water and juice that are yours for the taking. We were very pleased with the upgraded Towers, everyone should check it out!",1,nan,ta_p306
trip_advisor,"We just got back from a great weekend in Chicago and have no complaints about the Palmer House. It's very easy to get to from O'hare(the Blue line on the EL train) and then just a 2 block walk from the train station. The hotel itself is beautiful and the staff is super friendly and go out of their way to help. We booked an air/hotel package deal on Expedia. We expected to stay in a room with a full size bed but for only $45 extra per night we upgraded to the Excutive level! Best decision of the trip. We had a beautiful room with a King bed,down comforter,robes,plush towels etc...it also included a nice Continental breakfast each morning,all day snacks and beverages and a great happy hour! We took advantage of this every day. The location was great..lots of shopping along State St. and to get to the Magnificent Mile was a $5 cab ride or a 20 minute walk! We'll be back to Chicago and the Palmer House!",1,nan,ta_p307
trip_advisor,"Guys trip to Chicago, scored this hotel on Priceline for $100 a night. Had a little confusion over the bed situation at first. They said they only had kings available even after I had called and requested 2 doubles. After a 30 minute ordeal at the front desk they put us in a room with 2 doubles. The room was nice, nothing specacular, a little on the small side but nice. The lobby was beautiful to look at but that's about it. Hotel is within walking distance to Soldier Field, Sears Tower, ESPN Zone, and lots of bars and restaurants. Great location that and the price we got the room for made our trip. Would definately try and stay at this hotel again.",1,nan,ta_p308
trip_advisor,"We just returned from a weekend at the Palmer House. We normally stay north on the Mag Mile but wanted to be closer to Soldier's Stadium and the Art Insitiute this time. We were able to upgrade to a suite upon arrival at half the price that we paid for a regular room at the Four Seasons two weeks earlier. What a suite!! It was huge. The basic living room, dining room and kitchen/wet bar area was one large room. Up to three additional bedrooms can be added by the use of connecting doors. All rooms were spotlessly clean. They even smelled good. Lovely soaps, robes, etc. Lots of large closets. The bathrooms were older but well maintained. Much better than the ones at the Four Seasons. The furniture was nice but worn in some spots. The beds and linens were excellent. Room service was fast. The food and service were great. The pool and workout areas were clean and well maintained. We had one small problem with a burned out lightbulb in one of the lamps. Maintaince arrived quickly with a new bulb. They wouldn't allow me to tip them!! Check-in was somewhat slow as the hotel has been sold out for several weeks. This is a very large hotel, so they have to move a lot of people and rooms. Also, the hotel does not have views as it is configured like an ""E"". All in all, the Palmer House is a good value for the money.",1,nan,ta_p309
trip_advisor,"My wife and I decided to spend three days in Chicago last summer, and booked via Expedia. When we first walked into the lobby we almost fell over at its' beauty. It's like something out of Europe. We were able to get a free room upgrade, even though the rooms are still a bit small, but its' an old hotel in an old city. It's there for sleeping and showering. The restaurants, lounges, and shops were all wonderfull. The next time we travel to Chicago, I'll be affraid to stay anywhere other than the Palmer House Hilton",1,nan,ta_p310
trip_advisor,"I booked this hotel for $75 on Hotwire with mid-level expectations for one night. Totally blown away. Arrived on a Sunday night. Gave car to valet ($51/night). Lobby was a social people watching scene with swank music. Check-in was smooth and easy. I asked for an upgrade and was told no free upgrades to 3rd party bookings. Upgrade to suite was available at a cost. I passed since only 1 night stay. I asked for a nice, quiet room away from noisy housekeeping and ice machine. Received room 10-120. Room was huge with 2 beds. Felt like 400 square feet. Newly renovated last year. Bell hop told me some rooms are very small so I totally lucked out! Service from start to finish was top notch. Everyone had a smile on their face. Always spoke with great respect and made us feel welcome. Ordered room service at 10:45 PM. Arrived in 1/2 hour. food was so-so. Had pancakes in Lockwood for breakfast. Very good food and very good service. Strong coffee. Hotel is right on State Street shopping. FYI - Rooms on floors 15 and below were renovated last year. Rest were done 5 years ago. For the price, it was a great bargain! Only complaint is bathroom is small.",1,nan,ta_p311
trip_advisor,"We booked this hotel using points on our credit card. When we arrived, we were immediately greeted by a friendly face. We arrived several hours before check-in. However, they let us check-in early. They also gave us a free room upgrade. The hotel is absolutely stunning! In addition, it is off of State Street. There are many things to do - shopping, dinning, theater. It is also close to public transportation if you would like to go to the United Center or the airport. The hotel also allowed us to have a late check-out at no additional charge. The room was so dark and quiet we slept in.",1,nan,ta_p312
trip_advisor,"I stayed at the Palmer House for @ $150/night on a corporate rate. The bed was excellent, the linens/towels were top of the line. I did not find my room shabby, as other reviewers noted. The Palmer House is over 130 years old. Rooms have older woodwork and classic furniture; I think that lends to the ambience of the place. It is expensive, and I'm not sure I'd stay there if my company weren't picking up the tab. But the hotel itself is still awe-inspiring.",1,nan,ta_p313
trip_advisor,"Attended a conference at the Palmer House and it truly surpassed my expectations. I had no idea it would be so large, so nice and with so many amenities. I also didn't realize that it is just around the corner from Milenium Park and the Art Institute. We were met at the door by the friendliest staff. Even with a long line at check-in, the entire process was about 10 minutes. We enjoyed the room with the up-to-date TV, decent size bathroom and comfortable bed. Had a fantastic breakfast buffet as well as a delicious take-out lunch at the main restaurant. Paid $200/night through the conference which seemed quite fair considering downtown Chicago. We have stayed at the Sofital which is much more upscale, but we also paid over $300/night there.",1,nan,ta_p314
trip_advisor,"beautiful place with European charm. No complaints, great location, (never like parking in Chicago, though). It was $35 a night next door. Large beautiful lobby, a touch of class. Fantastic location for downtown, Navy Pier, and the great Grant Park(Millenium Park, too)...Loved it.",1,nan,ta_p315
trip_advisor,"Spent three nights at the hotel for a girls weekend. The staff was wonderful, room was beautiful and location great. You can take the train directly from Midway and walk one block to the hotel. Very close to museums and restaurants. I have stayed here before and it always proves to be a great choice for a trip to Chicago.",1,nan,ta_p316
trip_advisor,"It has been a couple of years since I stayed here, and got it for a night last weekend on Hotwire. I paid only $100 and stayed a Saturday night. I was very impressed with the redecorating done to the hotel. The lobby has always been great, but the rooms were a little shabby in the past. Not any more, as the hotel has been redecorated in the last few years. The location is still amazing, and with the Berghoff open again, there is a great restaurant within walking distance.",1,nan,ta_p317
trip_advisor,"Stayed here October 31 through November 5 for a cconference. This is beautiful hotel and the location is perfect. The Art Institute and Millenium Park is a short 2 block walk from the hotel. My room was small, but beautiful. The bed was comfy and there were plenty of pillows. Alas, no coffee maker in the room...The staff was helpful and friendly. I'd stay here again!",1,nan,ta_p318
trip_advisor,"We just returned from a girls shopping /sight-seeing trip.The Palmer House was like home away from home.The hotel is undergoing renovations but we did not notice any inconveniences or hear any noise from the work.The lobby was breathtaking, all dressed up for Christmas.The staff from check-in to housekeeping was very welcoming and friendly.Our room was updated with two beds and two separate baths which was great for everyone to have their own personal space.I would not hesitate to recommend this hotel to anyone.Chicago is a great town.",1,nan,ta_p319
trip_advisor,I stayed here for about a week during a conference and the service was excellent. In addition to the excellent service the location was great. With quick access to Michigan Ave.. The bars and Shula's restaurant were excellent. You must have the rib-eye steak...very well done.,1,nan,ta_p320
trip_advisor,"When we were stranded in Chicago for two days since our flight home was canceled, our airline put us in touch with hotels.com who found us the room at the Sheraton Towers. After a long and frustrating day that ended up with us still in Chicago, arriving at the Sheraton was a joy. The entire staff was wonderful. The bell staff was great helping us (finally) let go of the heavy bags, Jonathan at check in was very helpful and had us in a room which he upgraded for us in no time. We enjoyed the location and the facilities of this property during our unexpected stay and would highly recommend this location to others. We can't say enough about the staff. If we are in Chicago in the future we will definitely return here!",1,nan,ta_p321
trip_advisor,"We stayed at the Sheraton by Navy Pier the first weekend of November and were very pleased with the accommodations and the service. We were upgraded to club level rooms and stayed in 3114 and 3115 adjoining. The view from both rooms was spectacular (as you can tell from the picture attached). They also left a plate of cookies and treats in the kids room upon check-in which made us all feel very special. The hotel is central to both Navy Pier and Michigan Ave. so we walked, trolleyed, and cabbed all around the area. We ate the breakfast buffet both mornings and thought it was pretty good. The eggs were a little runny, but they happily made a different batch for us at the omelet station. Our six year old ate free and our two eleven year olds were $14 (instead of the adult $20) The rooms were clean, the concierge & reception staff were both friendly and helpful...we will definitely visit this Sheraton again when we're in Chicago next time.",1,nan,ta_p322
trip_advisor,"Having booked the hotel directly with the hotel on its website, I arrived tired from Ireland, to find that they had mislaid my booking and had no room on that night, but did have rooms for the rest of the week. They booked me in to another (not as nice) downtown hotel and paid for my taxi to that hotel and for that nights accommodation. On my return to the hotel next day, I was upgraded to the Club level. What really impressed me was that the hotel did everything they could to make up for their earlier mistake...unprompted. Of course, the hotel itself (particularly on the 32nd floor) is excellent. I will definitely be back.",1,nan,ta_p323
trip_advisor,"We recently celebrated our 20th anniversary in Chicago and stayed at the Sheraton Chicago Hotel and Towers. Having looked at a gizillion places I chose this one because of its location to Navy Pier. (We were going on a dinner cruise-The Odyssey at Navy Pier) The hotel is a short walk...unless you are wearing heels:) to Navy Pier. We found out on the way home only a $5 cab ride:) worth $20 to your blisters!! Its also only a short walk to Michigan Ave shopping...for comfortable shoes perhaps?? I chose this hotel because of location, but the views are also terrific. This time we had a lake view of Navy Pier, but our previous trip we had a river and lake view. both very nice. The hotel is very nice. Several restaurants, although we haven't tried them. The burger place downstairs sure smelled good though:) We ended up at Bubba Gumps at Navy Pier. GOOD! The rooms were very spacious and CLEAN!! I am kind of a germaphobe! so clean is important for my sanity:) The bottom level has doors that leads right out to the riverwalk, and a cool water fountain. :) I obviously highly recommend this hotel:) I <3 CHICAGO",1,nan,ta_p324
trip_advisor,The sheraton was a wonderful hotel! When me and my mom flew in we were really tired so we decided to take a quick nap. We didnt want to get up! The beds are absolutely to die for. I wanted to take it home with me. The service was great and this was probably one of the biggest if not the biggest hotel ive ever stayed in. They had a really nice restaurant inside with excellent food.,1,nan,ta_p325
trip_advisor,"We always stay at the Sheraton Chicago Hotel & Towers when we take our kids to the city. You can't beat the location which is in walking distance of Navy Pier and Michigan Ave. The hotel is also just a couple of blocks from the fabulous Fox & Obel, a high end grocery store with many prepared items available to go and a great cafe that serves a stellar breakfast. The hotel staff are professional and courteous and the rooms are more than adequate with very comfy beds. My kids enjoy the pool with it's windows that overlook the Chicago river.",1,nan,ta_p326
trip_advisor,"My husband, teenage son and myself stayed at this hotel last August. We were transferred there by tour operator who had sent us to a terrible hotel on the other side of Chicago. When I complained I asked for us to be transferred to the Sheraton which they arranged for us. I have stayed at many hotels in my life and this has been the best. The room (although I know it was not the largest) was beautiful and very clean with every amenity you needed. It also had superb views of the river and the lake. The entrance hall to the Sheraton is so imressive as is the leisure centre. In fact all areas are fantastic. The best thing about the hotel though was the staff! From the bellboy, to the receptionists, the dining staff to the concierge - each one was courteous and so very helpful. One of the conciergies spent fifteen minutes on the phone trying to locate a specific pair of trainers for my son! Above and beyond the call I would say! I cannot reccomend this hotel highly enough. The breakfast buffet cost about 10 dollars each but you could eat as much as you like and take as long as you like which we did!! It lasted us all day. If you have the choice of where to stay I think you will enjoy the Sheraton! We did!!",1,nan,ta_p327
trip_advisor,"We stayed at this hotel for 4 nights in August. We waited a while to check in even though there were quite a few desks open, this was a little annoying as the receptionists seemed to work in two's. Our room had a great view of Navy Pier and was a good size. The bed was very comfortable and the room was spotlessly clean. The location of the hotel is the best, we walked to Navy Pier and Michigan Ave. The breakfast buffet was great although a little pricey and the bar very relaxing for a nightcap or two. Would certainly recommend this hotel and would stay here again.",1,nan,ta_p328
trip_advisor,"I have been 4 times in Chicago, and I have stayed in 4 different Hotels: This has been for much the very best option. The lobby, the warm of the receptionist, the room, the hotel is very good. It is walking distance to the Magnificent Mile and there's no chance for you to get lost from this hotel. If you like to travel with style this could be a very good option.",1,nan,ta_p329
trip_advisor,"I stayed for just one nite at the Sheraton Hotel and Towers and was a little nervous after reading a few negative reviews from other TA posters but I was not let down. I got the room via PL @ $70 and was first placed in a room on the 8th floor with a fabulous view of the roof of the lobby and a parking lot. Since I had nothing to lose, I asked to be moved to a ""room with a view"". The front desk attendant( Rasheeda) wanted to make sure that the room I had at first was clean and was in order and I assured her that it was. She then moved me up to the 24th floor with ease and it took about 1 minute. I was quite surprised as I have heard that they treat PL and Hotwire folks with a little less love than full price customers. The new room was very clean and spacious and overlooked the Navy Pier, a few other skyrise condos and the beautiful infinity of Lake Michigan. All this for $70? Yep! I skipped room service and walked to the local gourmet market as suggested by others and it was pricey but all food there was delicious! The room was comfy, had an ample closet and room to breathe as well as a convenient internet connection location. I didnt use it since I wasnt staying that long but at least it was on the desk. The bed and pillows were very comfy, but I awoke at about 330 in the morning sweating from the comfy but VERY WARM and somewhat weighty duvet on the bed. This was a great deal for the price and I would absolutely stay here again.",1,nan,ta_p330
trip_advisor,"I booked this via Priceline, and was not sure I'd like it, as some Sheratons have fallen off the cliff. This hotel absolutely surpassed my expectations. Despite booking with Priceline, I was treated like a king. They let me check in early, gave me a beautiful room, and even went so far as to look up my Starwood number so I could get some credit for the stay. The staff was unfailingly pleasant, the property immaculate, and the room very comfortable. I highly recommend this hotel.",1,nan,ta_p331
trip_advisor,"Great location - right on the Chicago River - away from the other skyscraper hotels - our room was good size, very clean and with a nice river view - Overall, a great staff - in particular I would like to point out Christy Morgan - Chief Experience Officer and Paula Fortney - Concierge for their assistance in making this stay a memorable one - (in the interests of full disclosure, we stayed here on our AMEX - Starwood points)",1,nan,ta_p332
trip_advisor,"This is a great hotel! The views are fabulous, the service it friendly and the location is superb. We booked a room on an upper floor and had access to the lounge where breakfast and snacks were available with picture perfect views of the Chicago River. The only negative is that the ceilings in the hall and room are low and can make you feel a little cramped. We booked our room for $89 a night for Memorial Day weekend. It was a steal!

We didn't know where to stay in Chicago, but booked one night at the Sheraton Chicago Hotel and Towers based on their ad in the Chicago Visitors Guide. We're glad we did! We enjoyed our stay very much. Our room was very comfortable and well appointed and had a wonderful view of the city. That's what we wanted--a great view, and we got it. Also, the hotel is within walking distance of many attractions and is accessible from the bus stop (we took the train and bus from the airport into the city and it wasn't bad--saved us a lot of money). The elevators to our room were fast and quick and there was one always available. We found the front desk staff to be friendly and accommodating. The only downside for us is that we had only booked one night in Chicago. We wish we could have stayed there at the Sheraton for at least another night. We would definitely stay there again.",1,nan,ta_p335

trip_advisor,"This is one of my favorite Sheratons/Starwood properties. I have stayed at a lot of hotels (mostly Starwood) in Chi but all around, this is my favorite based on cost, amenities and downtown location. I really like it beginning with unloading the taxi because I am greeted by Nick who has been there for years. He gives the best greeting from LA to NY and is always happy! He obviously loves his job. People at the front desk are always nice and efficient. If you like to workout, Roberta runs their fitness center. Another one who loves their job and serves guests well. Great lake / river view while working out. On this particular trip I was caught in a pinch; however, Christy the former mgr was able to take care of a frequent guest. I considered it a ""minor miracle"" based on hotel availability. The maids on 29th floor were very friendly and efficient. Another great experience.",1,nan,ta_p338
trip_advisor,"The Sheraton is a fantastic hotel. My wife and I stayed on the 29th floor overlooking the Chicago River and Lake Michigan. The view was great.

The rooms are clean, chic and roomy, the beds - the best I have slept in, bathrooms large and super clean. What can I say, my new home when in Chicago...",1,nan,ta_p340
trip_advisor,"Mostly great with a few islands of relatively minor problems. First the good: Outside of the hotel and lobby were decorated like a winter wonderland, as befitted the season. The restaurant service was absolutely flawless ( servers who don't write orders because they are expected to remember them, remember clients clearly from one day to the other, and go above and beyond consistently). Rooms are comfortable: yes the beds are great! The gym is well equipped. Second the slightly off putting: mmmhh...we got the ""I love chocolate package"" which advertized: bfast every day, dinner once, snack once and...a gift. And we have an A-Club favorite guest membership, which also advertized "" a gift"". So, no gift...either for the chocolate package or the favorite guest membership. Upon enquiry, ""the snack was the gift"". Not at all what the package suggested. That said, bfast was sublime and the chocolate dinner outstanding as well. Some problems at checkout though: we got charged for all dining despite having booked the package and it took quite a while for a polite but seemingly less than informed front desk staff to correct the problem. Would absolutely go back, but probably not on a special package.",1,nan,ta_p341

Good restaurant at the hotel serving a la carte breakfast different from the usual fare and with a nice French twist. Dinner at the restaurant was also good. Prices are reasonable. Room is comfortable, only problem was with a card access door lock that usually required several swipes before opening. Excellent service from the bellmen to the concierge and front desk staff. Would definitely stay here again if visiting Chicago. Concierge recommended a small van tour, which was excellent.

Location was great, head left from the lobby and you reach a bunch of european style cafe's and restaurants. Straight ahead of the hotel on Michigan Ave is a shoppers paradise. A great place to stay, and much better value than Park Hyatt. I do find some of the charges in luxury hotels to be a bit crazy, such as for the internet. When you are paying top dollar, a few inclusions would be nice.",1,nan,ta_p343

It's a sleek, modern, sophisticated hotel with European touches. We spent three days there on a leisure weekend, we had a 29th floor king room looking directly at the Hancock Building, at a total cost including taxes and lugs of about $165 a night. The room was average sized, well-appointed, everything in it worked, and it had a fabulous view of the Chicago high-rise jungle, including snippets of the lake. The public areas were wonderfully decorated. The restaurant served a good breakfast at, for Chicago, reasonable prices. The staff was excellent.

When you called either the Front Desk or Room Service, the phone was answered with ""Hallo Mrs (Name)"" which was a great personal touch. Vanessa at the front desk, went out her way to help me - storing some things in a safe for me before I could book into my room. My room was wonderful - the bathroom was luxurious. I was on the 30th floor and the views were superb. We ordered room service and it came quickly and the guy was so friendly and nice. The doormen were great too and I wore jeans and a tshirt one day and they still opened the door for me, so no snobbery there. Comfortable, cozy bathrobes were available in the bathroom, the lights went on in the wardrobe (never seen that before!!), tv was HD ready and flat screen.

We loved our rooms, which were just the basic type on the lower floors but they were very well appointed. The decor is modern and personally I liked it a lot. The rooms were pleasant and airy and the bed extremely comfortable. The hotel location is just perfect, close to the shops on Michagan Avenue, and the beach at Oak Street. Lovely restaurants close by and nightlife in Rush Street is just steps away. The area although bustling was peaceful and quiet. We could walk to most places and I would not hesitate to stay here again. The hotel staff very helpful, always smiling and ready to help; from the doormen to the helpful lady at Conceriage. I would not hesitate at all to stay at Sofitel Water Tower Place next time I'm in Chicago; in fact I look forward to my next visit.",1,nan,ta_p355
trip_advisor,"We just arrived from a 3 nights stay at the Sofitel Chicago Water Tower. It was faboulous. Fine Linen, nice room with bigs windows, bathroom with a shower, flat TV. Check for the deals on the Sofitel website, we had 3 nights for the price of two !",1,nan,ta_p356
trip_advisor,"We just got back from 3 nights at the Sofitel. We really have nothing bad or negative to say about it. We've stayed at other higher end hotels in Chicago such as the Park Hyatt, The Peninsula, and The Four Seasons - and the Sofitel tops them all. It's a 4 star hotel with 3 star prices. It's a beautiful hotel all the way around. Staff is uniformly friendly without being patronizing. They were helpful with the one small problem we had and solved it quickly. The common areas are fresh and modern in appearance. The room was very clean with comfortable beds and well-appointed marble-accented baths. My wife loved the huge tub. We had breakfast via roomservice every morning and it was always hot and delicious. The robes and Evian at turndown was always appreciated. The property is ideally situated in the middle of the Gold Coast and all the best shopping and eating is within a short walk. Want a Bentley or latte? They're all close by. This was our second stay since it opened and I'm sure it's to be our home away from home when we are in Chicago.",1,nan,ta_p357
trip_advisor,"Beautifully appointed, professionally staffed, comfortable, well-located, and elegant, with wireless internet access (plus free access in an alcove on the second floor), fitness center (a little small but fine if you use it at the right time), good energy clientele, easy access to Michigan Avenue, next door to 24-hour restaurant, 2 blocks from 2 Starbucks, elevators that are there before you get your finger off the button - they thought of everything. Will definitely return!",1,nan,ta_p358

trip_advisor,"We booked our room at the Swissotel on Hotwire for $88 (unbelievable rate!) and were extremely impressed with the Swissotel. The staff was so polite and catered to our every need. The room was oversized, clean, and had a large bathroom. We had a partial view of Lake Michigan, which was an added bonus. On the 42nd floor, they have a spotless workout room and pool with a view of the city and lake from 3 sides. Spectacular! We sat in the hot tub and looked down on Navy Pier. We can't wait to go to the Swissotel again!",1,nan,ta_p360
trip_advisor,"We stayed at the swissotel for our 25th anniversary. We got a corner room with both a lake and city view. The room was very clean and spacious. The staff was extremely friendly and helpful. We asked for late checkout, and was told no problem. If you bring your car, park in millinum parking it is just 2 blocks away. The cost there is $14.00 compared to the swissotel which is $41.00.",1,nan,ta_p361
trip_advisor,"Stayed here for one night in June, but have stayed here before when on business in Chicago. Great location for business/shopping/sightseeing. In between Michigan Avenue's Magnificent Mile and the Loop and next to the Chicago River. Rooms very spacious and clean. Gym has a wonderful view, as it is situated on the top of the hotel. Bar next to lobby, very busy with good atmosphere. Cannot fault the hotel. Prefer it to the Westin - my previous address when in Chicago.",1,nan,ta_p362
trip_advisor,"The Swisshotel is awesome. Very high class. It is expensive , but so is every hotel in Chicago. It is off from the dingy areas of our city , yet a long walk to Navy Pier, so you will need to pay for the cab. Note to all the Magnificent Mile is boring as can be. I live in Chicago and the hotel is a better experience than the Mile of Navy (BORING) Pier.",1,nan,ta_p363
trip_advisor,"Swissotel was the cleanest hotel I have ever stayed in! The room and bathroom were quite large for downtown Chicago. The pool and hot tub were also very nice. I would definately recommend this hotel. We didn't hear any noise in our room from other guests or from the city. It is in a great location - walking distance to Millenium Park, the Loop and Michigan Ave.",1,nan,ta_p364
trip_advisor,"a great hotel, we used the CTA the 2 days we were in Chicago and it is great, that the Line 6 stops nearly in front of the hotel. So we did not need any taxi and traveled from Midway to the city and to Ohare for 9$ and we used the buses alot (freezing cold). The hotel itself is great, very clean rooms, realy on of the best bathrooms i ever had. Staff very friendly, they even found me out were i can get Timerland shoes.... and she was right i got them in one place she told me... thats service...I also was having a look to the gym room and the swimming pool area, did not use it and I do not know if it would have been included in the room price....but realy a nice view makes running easyer....",1,nan,ta_p365
trip_advisor,"If you want to stay in a fabulous hotel in the city and you're willing to pay a little extra, I'd recommend this place.Also, pay the extra for a corner room - the views of the city are spectacular.A short walk to Michigan Avenue. Excellent service from the valets, concierge, lobby agents, and waitstaff in the restaurants. The food in the restaurants was great and room service wasn't too shabby either.Well worth the money!",1,nan,ta_p366
trip_advisor,"I stayed at the Swissotel for a business trip the first week of Aug 2007. I arrived late the first night and got shoved into a hospitality room the first night. However, this was more than made up when after a strong talk they assigned me a corner room on the 28th floor. EXCELLENT view of the city, river and Lake Michigan. In fact, I would say the corner room of the Swissotel has a better view than any other hotel in the vicinity. The room was huge, and everything was clean and the bathroom was nice. The hotel is very convieniently located to the Magnificient Mile and Millenium Park. Would very much recommend this hotel, and would suggest trying every method possible to get a corner room in a higher floor.",1,nan,ta_p367
trip_advisor,"I thought the Swissotel was a great hotel. The rooms were very spacious and clean, especially for downtown Chicago standards. Most importantly, the rooms were quiet. I never heard people in the hallways when I was trying to sleep. The only downside was that the beds were not anything special. Sure, like all hotels in Chicago, this hotel caters to wealthy and/or business clients with ridiculous minibar and parking price. However, if you are aware of that prior to arrival, its not a big deal (ie finding a different place to park the car, bringing our own snacks for the room). It would be nice though if hotels such as the Swissotel had a microfridge in the room for guest use. Staff was very helpful. Bellmen instantly got cabs upon request, and the front desk was efficient and helpful. Overall, if I can get a good rate again, I'll stay at the Swissotel the next time I am in Chicago.",1,nan,ta_p368
trip_advisor,"My boyfriend and I were amazed by the breathtaking view of Lake Michigan! We are from Texas so the view of the city was very important to us. We had no problems at this hotel... rooms, service, location were top notch.",1,nan,ta_p369
trip_advisor,"This is a wonderful hotel with all the amenities. Everyone was helpful. The breakfast buffet was wonderful. The bed was ""just like home"". We would definitely stay again. A nice touch was the water bottles left in our car for us to enjoy on our way home. It was little touches like this that make this hotel one of the best.",1,nan,ta_p370
trip_advisor,"This was our third trip to Chicago this year (we LOVE the city!) - every time we stay at a different downtown hotel. Swissotel was definitely our favourite. When we come back in July to see the play "" Wicked"" for the second time, we will be again at Swissotel. No more need to try other hotels! The location is good because it is between the financial district and the Magnificent Mile. The room was spotless and quiet, the view amazing and those elevators were so fast. Comfortable beds, friendly service, not as many noisy sirens! We even watched the Navy Pier fireworks from our bed! This was the best anniversary ever. We would recommend Swissotel to everyone!",1,nan,ta_p371
trip_advisor,"Stayed here on business a few nights and really liked it. Very attractive, classy and comfortable hotel that's got an element of sexy and sharp. Public spaces are very nice, with an open area bar in the front lobby and nice sitting areas. Rooms are lovely as well, with handsome fixtures and furniture, a terrific desk work space and comfortable bed. Bathroom amenities and fixtures are sleek and attractive as well. Best of all, the hotel has breathtaking views of the city and the water - both the river and the lake. If you're working in the area, it's the best choice for that part of town, and I prefer it to the nearby Hyatt and Monaco.",1,nan,ta_p372
trip_advisor,"We have been for the first time in Chicago and stayed in the Swissotel for five nights,a wonderful place.Room was on the 29th floor,absolutely clean and nice and a breathtaking lakeview.Breakfast perfect and service really good.People were always helpful.It's a little bit far from Magnificent mile and the loop,but in front of the hotel there are buses (number6)waiting there next turn,not a real bus stop,but drivers are frindly and you can get on the bus.Next time going to Chicago we will again stay in the Swissotel.",1,nan,ta_p373
trip_advisor,"I just enjoyed a 3-day weekend at the Swissotel Chicago. A friend of mine booked it and got a GREAT rate. Cheaper than even a fleabag motel. So keep an eye out for specials. The view was great, the location was prime. The staff was helpful. The room was large (we had 2 double beds). I only have one complaint. Our room was next to some sort of storage or mechanical room where employees (I think) would sneak off to talk on the phone. The sound came right though the vent in our bathroom and we could hear them plain-as-day. Fortunately, the sound was only in the bathroom so it wasn't like it kept us up at night. It was just a little weird. Overall, a great stay and I will definitely stay there again.",1,nan,ta_p374
trip_advisor,"My 3 nieces and I stayed here for a long weekend, we had a wonderful time. We arrived early around 8:30am and they let us into our room. This was very nice otherwise we would have had to store our luggage and register later Room was very clean as was the bathroom. With 4 women we needed extra towels, they brought them up right away and then we got a call to make sure they were delivered. Room was also quiet, construction going on behind us and we never heard anything. Beds comfy and so were the quilts... Good location for Michigan Ave. All in all a wonderful stay. Would return.",1,nan,ta_p375
trip_advisor,"The best service!!! The staff here was incredible. You never had to lift a finger. The room was huge as hotel rooms go. The view was phenomenal. Location great. What a great weekend. We did stop for a drink at the Palm Restaurant and unfortunately, it closes at 11 p.m. Too bad!!! The Lobby Lounge is open later but drinks costs twice as much as the bar at the Palm.",1,nan,ta_p376
trip_advisor,"I loved it here! My boyfriend and I booked this hotel online and were a little worried what it would be like since we paid next to nothing for our 3 nights here. (I've paid more to stay at the Santa Barbara Motel 6!!) Gorgeous hotel, great staff, fun bar/lounge area and we were most impressed with the room. The large windows in the bathroom were the best--I took a bubble bath one night while looking at the views of Navy Pier and the skyline. I remember thinking, ""This is really living..."" The room was comfortable and quiet, again with great views just like in the bathroom. Chicago is a wonderful town--I have nothing but good things to say about it. CAn't wait to come back!",1,nan,ta_p377
trip_advisor,"We stayed at the Swissotel for a special birthday weekend for my wife from Aug 25 to 29. I had called ahead to ask for a nice room and to order flowers for my wife. Jaymes Ballard, the Concierge, made arrange for flowers, early check-in and we had a great room. Our room was the 33rd floor with a view facing the city. Room was large, everything looked like new, great bed, large bathroom with separate shower, great ammenities. A beautiful bouquet of flowers arrived upon our arrival. The hotel is about 10 mins from everything, not close but not far from anything. Has a great restaurant, 2 patios outside where I had a cigar. A really nice pool and hot tub on the 42nd floor. I would recommend this hotel to anyone and thanks to Jaymes for making our trip very special.",1,nan,ta_p378
trip_advisor,I recently stayed at this hotel with my family (10-1 / 10-3). We had a terrific experience. I landed the hotel through Priceline for $80 per night and paid an additional $75 per night for a suite on the 41st floor. My two young boys loved it as the view was unbelieveable and the pool on the 42nd floor was easily accessible. I found all the employees that we interfaced with to be very friendly and accommodating. I would love to stay here again.,1,nan,ta_p379
trip_advisor,"Very quaint and romantic, yet masculine. I've noticed that at most Chicago hotel bars it's hard to get a drink much less a seat but I guess because it's a small hotel that was not a problem at the Talbott - plus people take their drinks out to the seating in the lobby because it's so inviting - cozy and comfortable - love that! Would love to stay again but I must say that I was surprised by all the comments on the comfortable beds - ours was too firm. Also note there is no gym on the premises - but walking and shopping is enough of a workout!",1,nan,ta_p380
trip_advisor,"My girlfriends and I stayed 4 nights at the Talbott returning home on Saturday 9/29. We all had a wonderful time and thoroughly enjoyed the hotel. The staff from top to bottom were excellent, accommodating. The room was roomy...with our only complaint being not being able to cool the room fast enough after a day on the town. The construction next door was obstructing the sidewalk, but being on a oneway street limited that difficulty. The doorman, Andrew was an excellent source at this hotel. He arranged all our transportation at night to restaurants. We enjoyed everything about the hotel and the city. The hotel was expensive but met expectations.",1,nan,ta_p381
trip_advisor,"My wife and I just spent 3 nights at The Talbott. The room was spacious, comfortable and well-appointed. The hotel is quiet although there is some construction nearby. Linens and towels first-class. Free Wi-Fi in the room. The location is terrific, just one block to Michigan Avenue. We will stay here on future visits.",1,nan,ta_p382
trip_advisor,"As we pulled away in a taxi heading to the airport for our trip home my wife turned to me and said ""We picked the right place."" Having chosen the Talbott from other Trip Advisor reviews I found myself thinking in terms of a Trip Advisor review when we arrived. Nice entrance, friendly reception, I noticed everything and immediately knew the Talbott was a non-corporate warm hotel with touches not typically seen in big name hotel chains. The smell of the elevator and attention to decorative details strongly reminded me of Europe, simple, not overstated but elegant. The location is great, there was light snow but we walked to the Art Institute, Rush Street, the Theater District, and we're from California where anything below 50 degrees keeps us inside! All I can say is if you are the kind of traveler that wants comfort, class and somewhere unique, stay at the Talbott. Oh yeah, we were in a room that looked down at the construction, we were on the 15th floor and could not hear a sound, it was very quiet.",1,nan,ta_p383
trip_advisor,"I have just returned from a lovely shopping trip to Chicago. It is a very nice hotel, and I will love to stay there if I visit Chicago again! There is a lot of positive to say about the hotel; staff is excellent, never experienced such an excellent service -- that alone is worth coming back for. Was pleasantly surprised that the room rate was including breakfast. A few things that could make this hotel even better... A hand shower in the bathroom. The hairdryer to be placed in the bedroom, instead of the bathroom, when the bathroom is all damp after a shower I prefer leaving the bathroom to dry my hair. Free internet access in the lobby. I was surprised I had to pay 6 or 7 USD (for 15 minutes) to log-on and check-in with my airline (only with a few airlines you can check-in without paying?!?!?!?)",1,nan,ta_p384
trip_advisor,We loved our stay at the Talbott. We were in Chicago to attend the theater show Dirty Dancing. We booked our room through Orbitz and received a nice discount. When we arrived at the hotel everyone from the doorman to the front desk to the maids were highly professional and courtesy. We were upgraded to a King bed suite. The suite was well decorated and spacious. My wife particularily enjoyed the heat that could be directed at the marble floor in the bathroom. We loved the hotel and will definitely stay at the Talbott on our next trip to Chicago. Highly recommended.,1,nan,ta_p385
trip_advisor,"My wife and I stayed two nights at the Talbott at the end of February. This little hotel was the perfect place for us. The lobby is very small but also cozy, and with both fireplaces going it was a welcoming atmosphere coming in from the cold. The staff was very friendly and efficient. The room was pretty spacious, and the king bed was extremely comfortable. We had a seventh floor room facing delaware st, so there was really no view. The bathroom was a good size, including two sinks and a spacious tub/shower. There was also free wireless internet...a big plus for us. Perhaps the best thing about the Talbott is the location. We were only a few steps from State, Rush, and North Michigan. Tons of shopping, bars, and good food are easily within walking distance. This makes the Talbott a great place for tourists who want to walk around and take everything in. We highly recommend the Talbott, and will gladly stay again on return trips.",1,nan,ta_p386
trip_advisor,"Location, location, location. What a great find! Excellent, well-run, small boutique-type hotel on a tree-lined street near all the action without being in the oppressive crunch of it. Rooms are good-sized and clean; good bed and shower with tub. The air conditioner, as mentioned in other reviews, is noisy, but it's a minor complaint. The staff is simply wonderful and attentive from housecleaning to concierge. The on site restaurant is great. The red-line El is about 3-4 blocks away which makes getting around the city a breeze. You are footsteps away from Rush Street and North Michigan Avenue and Lake Michigan. I would not have a moment's hesitation booking at this hotel again in the future; in fact, I wouldn't book anywhere else.",1,nan,ta_p387
trip_advisor,"We stayed here because of all the great reviews, and it's all true. We were highly impressed with the high quality of everything, everyone, and the location. Walking distance to much of what Chicago has to offer. Gibson's steakhouse and the Hancock building to name a couple. This hotel should really be in the top ten or even top five hotels for Chicago. It should also have more than three stars. I mean three stars is for the hilton garden inn or marriott courtyard, and this place far exceeds chain hotels like those. Depending on the room you get, any price under $250 would be a good deal. Between 250 - 300 could still be worth it.",1,nan,ta_p388
trip_advisor,"I stayed at the Talbott twice in the last few weeks. I was very pleased with every facet of my stays. The staff, from doormen to front desk, to concierge, to housekeeping, were wonderful. The rooms were nicely sized and clean, and well stocked. I will return to the Talbott anytime!",1,nan,ta_p389
trip_advisor,"My husband and I stayed here for three nights while visiting Chicago as tourists. What a beautiful hotel! Our room was lovely, the staff was super helpful and the location was convenient. They don't have an in house gym, but each day you can get a day pass to a cushy gym down the street. The restaurant in the hotel has a very yummy breakfast. The concierge helped us to make dinner reservations at the last minute our first night there. We were able to walk down the Magnificent Mile from our hotel, as well as through the Gold Coast and Old Towne neighborhoods. There are tons of great restaurants in the area (including the famous Gibsons and the Signature Room in the Hancock tower) as well as lots of shopping. There is currently a lot of construction going on near the Talbott (they are building condos right behind it), but regardless we had a wonderful stay and would definitely stay there again when visiting Chicago.",1,nan,ta_p390
trip_advisor,We booked at another hotel a block away and spent a unhappy night. We walked over to the Talbott and the courtiest staff showed us a room and we booked the rest of our stay. The room was very attractive and well furnished with double sinks in the bathroom. The tub is large and the shower a pleasure. The location was quiet as requested. The staff was always cheerful and very helpful. Tim and Stephanie provide excellent concierge services! The breakfast at the Basil Cafe is a great way to start the day. We travel a lot and appreciate the ambiance of a good hotel. I would highly recommend the Talbott for your stay.,1,nan,ta_p391
trip_advisor,"Stayed 5 nights at this great hotel. Updated rooms. Clean. Used Tim to book theater and dinning reservations. Provided excellent service. Close to subway, shopping and dinning. Excellent value. Free wireless internet and access to nearby health club very nice perks. Highly recommend it. Future concern is adjacent construction of condos. Not a problem while we were there but something to ask front desk about in the future.",1,nan,ta_p392
trip_advisor,"Stayed at the Talbott for over a week and enjoyed our stay. Room was a little noisy as we were next to the lift, but everything else made up for that. Positives: Bed was very comfortable, great to have real shower, free internet, gym usage, staff (all friendly) and location. Negative: Lift noise, lifts slow and restaurant (there are so many great restaurants around - don't bother staying in) Would stay again!",1,nan,ta_p393
trip_advisor,"Just returned from a 3 night stay at the Talbott. This was our first visit there, and I can honestly say that I wouldn't stay at any other hotel in Chicago. From when we first were greated by the bell captain until our final departure, the staff was nothing less than amazing, always greeting with a smile and can I help you attitute. The room we had (1508) was very spacious and comfortable. The bed was probably the most comfortable that my wife and I have ever slept in (including the Four Seasons). Had great breakfasts and drinks at Basil's. You would be missing a fantastic experience, if you didn't stay at the Talbott.",1,nan,ta_p394
trip_advisor,"I stayed at The Talbott for 3 nights on business and was very pleased. The staff was friendly as can be immediately confirming the lore of the midwest. I was upgraded to a suite which was bigger than my apartment and certainly more luxurious. The free wi-fi came in handy as I needed to work remotely while there. Everything from the comfort of the bed to the staff and location made this a great stay. Oh, and I got to workout at the huge Equinox right next door for free.",1,nan,ta_p395
trip_advisor,"We loved the Talbott. The location was fabulous...very close to the shopping. The hotel is smaller, but the rooms are very nice. They are very spacious and are able to be darkened to sleep well. Also, the beds are some of the most comfortable I have ever slept in. I might also add that our room at queen beds. The staff is all friendly and puts them themselves out for you. The hotel has a cute outdoor eating area on the sidewalk that has flowers, etc. It looks like a scene out of Europe. I would highly recommend the hotel. We were there with our daughters; ages 10 and 13.",1,nan,ta_p396
trip_advisor,"My husband attended a conference in Chicago for the weekend of June 22nd and I decided to tag along for the shopping! We flew into O'Hare and took a cab to the hotel, cost about $30. Everybody from the doorman to reception desk to concierge were extremely friendly and helpful. We had a room on the 9th floor which overlooked the construction, but we were hardly in the room so it didn't bother us. We were also never awakened due to construction noise and my husband is a very light sleeper. The room was clean and spacious enough for us. The bed is very comfy. We ate in the restaurant downstairs several times for breakfast and lunch and all meals were great. The location of this hotel is perfect. You are about 1&1/2 blocks from Michigan Ave and the Hancock tower. Can't beat that! There is also an adorable pet store called Tails In The City across from the hotel! I brought our dog back a couple of toys! They are very nice as well. All in all, no complaints. The hotel is clean and beyond what we were expecting. The staff is always friendly and the location is superb. It's a safe neighborhood-I walked around by myself and felt fine. We would definitely return.",1,nan,ta_p397
trip_advisor,"This is a great find for downtown Chicago. The price is right and the staff are excellent. As noted, there is construction going on around the hotel, but I didn't notice any issues that disturbed sleeping. I asked for a quiet room on an upper floor, and was gladly given one. The lobby is small, the atmosphere is that of a small boutique hotel. The concierge, Stephanie did a super job in finding us a restaurant and booking us reservations (along with a complimentary appetizer). We had a standard room, and it was spacious, tastefully decorated--everything we needed. The bathroom had a nice whirlpool tub for soaking--and the MP3 compatible radio was a nice perk. Just can't say enough about how nice the staff are--every single person you meet. Would definitely stay here again.",1,nan,ta_p398

Gene and Stephanie took great care of us. The rooms were spacious and very fresh. The elevators could be a bit slow at times. Aside from the construction next door, our stay was perfect.

The staff were friendly, helpful and the rooms were very clean and roomy. We loved being able to have the continental breakfast (cereal, danishes, fruit, yogurt, donuts, etc.) which was provided on each floor. People actually felt comfortable walking out to get their breakfast with their PJ's on then head back to their rooms. It helped on time and provided good nourishment as we headed out for the day. Also enjoyed complimentary drinks (one per person per day) from 5-8 each day. There were so many restaurants within walking distance and a short walk to Navy pier. We would definitely come back as we liked the size of the hotel compared to the larger chains.",nan,1,ex4

Continental breakfast was handy (set up on table by elevators) and coffee was fresh. Staff were courteous and room was quiet and clean. Over all it was a pleasant experience.",nan,1,ex5
expedia,Kinzie Hotel staff processed my check-in quickly. The room was clean and well-appointed (loved the double shower head). I got a great room with a decent view of Kinzie Street ... I appreciated being able to look out and see what was going on around me. I thought the daily continental breakfast had a good range of selections and I really appreciated that there was a breakfast spread on each floor so that I didn't have to wander around the building looking for it. The Kinzie will definitely be my go-to spot for future Chicago visits.,nan,1,ex6
expedia,"This hotel is centrally located in the downtown area close to Everything (with a capital ""E""). It was a quick walk away from the L (Blue Line from the airport gets you there) and steps away from restaurants, bars, and convenience stores. The amenities are reasonable overall, but the daily continental breakfast on each floor is pretty awesome. Great for a quick bite and tea/coffee on the way out. The gym was impressive and had everything I could have hoped for. The bed was very comfortable, and facing a brick wall was not as bad as I first thought it might be. I did, however, have issues with the front desk staff, who I think could have been much more polite, welcoming, and willing to assist. At the time of my check-in at 7pm, I found a dirty plate outside of my room and wondered if I had the wrong room number. I checked the key and it worked, so I wondered why the plate was there. As it turns out, it would remain there until the following morning when the housekeeping staff attended to the room; I had to walk past this crumby plate at least 6 times after I got there. When I asked the front desk staff about it, they said it was standard for guests to leave plates outside the rooms after the nightly appetizer/cocktail reception. They looked at me like I was crazy for thinking that I should find a clean room and entryway upon checking in. When did these people eat appetizers, leave the plate, and check out?! Check out is 12pm! The staff could have been much friendlier overall.",nan,1,ex7

What we simply couldn't understand is why on Earth the toilet has no lid??? It looks ugly and it is uncomfortable. The location is good, walking distance to almost everywhere. Breakfast is mediocre and not always enough for the guests, people were going to all floors to look for some pastry, which was the best part of breakfast. It was nice to hear welcome back from Drake at the door. Staff is kind.",nan,1,ex15
expedia,"Everything about this hotel is fine except for the noise at night. There are several bars/clubs nearby and you can hear music, shouting, etc all night long. It was difficult to get a good night's sleep. Kinzie needs to noise proof the rooms.",nan,1,ex16
expedia,From the first check in to checkout the staff was wonderful. Every effort was made to accommodate everything we needed. I would recommend the hotel to everyone. It is a great location within walking distance to many tourist sites.,nan,1,ex17
expedia,"Great location for the full 'Chicago experience'. The only downside was our windows faced another building and we could look right into their apartments when our shades were not down. A side effect of urban apartments/hotels. The breakfast buffet was nicely stocked and satisfied our needs, although not in a separate area... (in the hallway on each floor by the elevators).",nan,1,ex18
expedia,"Awesome experience. Was able to drive up to front of hotel, have car parked and was in and up to my room within minutes. Awesome breakfast in the morning on each floor by the elevator. Easy to grab some food and drink and take back to my room. Called down in the morning to have car ready and easy checkout. Car waiting outside ready to go.",nan,1,ex19
expedia,"We needed a break from the gloomy weather of Detroit so we decided to go to Chicago last minute. Stumbled upon this amazing hotel with a great deal. Great location just blocks from Michigan Ave and fun bars and restaurants!! Parking is a little steep at $62, but worth it with all the places nearby and the cleanliness of this hotel. Super clean and awesome decor. They have a cocktail hour with free apps. Didn't quite make it to the free breakfast in the morning but I'm sure it would have been worth it. Would visit again!",nan,1,ex20
expedia,"The staff was very helpful with suggestions on what to do, hotel was walking distance to river dying and parade and all the good bars... The cocktail hour was great, the breakfast only offers pastries and such no hot foods",nan,1,ex21
expedia,Very nice hotel. Room was clean and room bed was comfortable.,nan,1,ex22
expedia,"Everything was fine,but nothing was great. The decor detracted from an otherwise nice place. I've been here before and enjoyed more before the new design renovations. Fine for the price .",nan,1,ex23
expedia,"When checking into the Kinzie, we were so surprised about how beautiful it was inside. The staff at the hotel lobby were so welcoming and friendly. The rooms had great space and the bathroom was fairly large. The beds were so comfortable and the rooms were so quiet!!! The complimentary breakfast was great. It was served on each floor right in front of the elevators. They had muffins, danishes, coffee, yogurt, egg, etc, which was great. Only thing is that you need to go early because things do run out. They do replenish the breakfast often, but since there are 5 floors with breakfast, it might take a while before the attendant gets to your floor. They offer complimentary appetizers and cocktail drinks as a ""welcome."" We did not get to the appetizers (starts at 5:30PM and we got there at 7); however, they did honor the drink with a ""drink token."" We did not have any problems with hot water, which was great because we traveled in February and it was very cold outside. Overall, I was so happy with the hotel and I would definitely stay here again if traveling to Chicago!! Great boutique hotel!",nan,1,ex24
expedia,"My daughter and I had a long weekend in Chicago and had the best experience ever staying at the Kinzie. I originally booked this hotel for us because my daughter's name is ""Kinsey"" and thought it was just destiny! The staff was absolutely wonderful and made us feel like we were just part of the family!! They looked up tickets to shows, told us how to get to our destinations, hailed taxis, got our car, helped us pack the car, and more importantly, just ""loved on us"". I highly recommend the Kinzie!!! We can't wait to return...................when it's warmer :).",nan,1,ex25

expedia,"We stayed over Valentine's Day weekend, and immediately we were impressed by guest services. We were greeted at the door and offered a Valentine's Day sugar cookie. Check in was very quick and efficient. The staff is extremely friendly. Our room was everything we could have wanted with everything you could imagine needing. The managers reception on the sixth floor was a great time and made a lasting impression on us. With complimentary hors d'oeuvres and two complementary drinks for the Both of us we were completely satisfied before going out to dinner. Speaking of going out, it is centrally located and easy to get to fantastic restaurants within walking distance. It is right next-door to the bar public house which is a popular night spot. We will absolutely be staying again.",nan,1,ex27
expedia,Our stay was wonderful if I had to say anything it would be that I wish breakfast was in one location.,nan,1,ex28

expedia,This is the second time that I have stayed at the Kinzie Hotel. The hotel is comfortable with great restaurants nearby. The staff is very helpful and the provided happy hour is good and a nice opportunity to regroup with colleagues. The only problem that I have is the valet parking is $65 and the lots on either adjacent blocks is $22.,nan,1,ex31

expedia,Service and accomodations were very good. Location is very good.,nan,1,ex34
expedia,"I really liked the kinzie hotel when I first stepped into it. The hotel services were however a bit question-able. Mainly because of the following two issues: 1 - It said that it had a continental breakfast: Breakfast was served on every floor instead of a main dining area. Had very limited choices. All the food in the breakfast was of the cold type. The food ran out very quickly and was not promptly refilled unless we called them. Sometimes they forgot to put hot water for our tea, and had only coffee. 2 - I had a clogged bathroom at night. I kept calling the front desk, no one picked up. Nor did anyone get back to me. So I stayed the entire night with that situation. In the morning, I gave them the notice and they took care of it. I don't know if i will stay in the hotel again.",nan,1,ex35
expedia,"So great! I love this hotel! The breakfast was awesome (and included), the staff was super nice, and the location was really convenient and safe. I will stay here again!",nan,1,ex36
expedia,"We had a very easy stay. We came in the evening and left the following morning. We booked the hotel because it was near a restaurant event we were attending. The service was very good, the room had everything we needed and it is very nice that the free breakfast is by the elevator on every floor. We barely had to get dressed to walk down the hall and grab some cereal and juice!",nan,1,ex37
expedia,"Wonderful location, staff and rooms. Second stay here and not disappointed with my choice. The location is central to most of the city. Complimentary Wi-Fi, Cocktails between 5-8, and free continental breakfast each morning. All combined with a nice room. Will definitely be back again!!",nan,1,ex38
expedia,"stayed there for 2 nights. Very helpful staff. Rooms are good size, furniture are new and well designed. Kinzie is a solid alternative to higher priced competitors",nan,1,ex39
expedia,The hotel exceeded our expectations. The continental breakfast was much nicer quality than those I have experienced at other hotels. The hotel is stylish and modern yet simple and not over-the-top trendy. Everything smells clean and fresh. The complimentary hors d'oeuvres in the cocktail lounge every evening were a nice perk. I would definitely stay at Kinzie Hotel again in the future.,nan,1,ex40
expedia,"Rate was reasonable and everything about this hotel was great. I believe it was recently renovated because everything looks brand new. Staff was great. Room was clean & bed was super comfortable. Was awesome having the continental breakfast set up on each floor, was right outside our room in the hallway near the elevators. All kinds of restaurants, bars & clubs within walking distance, was a great weekend stay.",nan,1,ex41
expedia,"I really enjoyed my stay. The hotel staff was great, I loved the design of the rooms. I can't wait to stay there again.",nan,1,ex42
expedia,"The Kinzie provided us a great location for eating, walking and shopping. THe interior of the hotel was also on a consistent basis as nothing was advertised that was not provided. Cleanliness and service were terrific and these are two things we look for",nan,1,ex43

expedia,"Updated modern hotel, very good staff, convenient valet parking, great location close to many restaurants and bars.",nan,1,ex52
expedia,"We have stayed at the Kinzie previously when it was the Amalfi. We love the location as it is easy to get to both the blue line when coming in from the airport. The hotel offers a great breakfast that is located at the elevator banks of each floor. You pick out what you would like to eat and go back to your room to relax. We always enjoy the evening reception on the 6th floor. I would have given the room a 5 star rating overall but I did find it was cool in our room on the 2nd floor. To remedy this, I wore the housecoat to warm up. The reception area had a nice treat ie. hot chocolate, cider and cookies in the afternoon. If you want a nice quiet hotel, I would recommend the Kinzie. From Calgary, Canada",nan,1,ex53
expedia,"Hotel was average. The package came with free cocktails and breakfast. The front desk only gave us 2 tokens for free drinks, but gave us 2 more for a total of 4 free drinks which wasn't bad. Breakfast was average. No hot food, but it was plentiful. The hotel itself is only 6 floors and putting it right in the middle of downtown leaves most rooms with bad city views. Our room we needed to close all the blinds because people in the buildings across from us could easily see inside. The room was spacious. Only other bad thing was parking. The garages nearby were all $50+ per night. Unless you did it online then you saved maybe $8.",nan,1,ex54
expedia,"The location was great. Convenient to walk to most places. The hotel was great with the add on features which made it an incredibly good deal. The breakfasts were so convenient and had a good variety. The cookies when we got back in the late afternoon waiting in the lobby was a great touch and the appetizers and bar in the evenings was awesome. The appetizers were great with a nice selection of cheeses...hit the spot before getting ready for an evening out. We also loved having the free wi fi. For the price, this hotel CANNOT be beat.",nan,1,ex55
expedia,Parking was expensive $56 Breakfast was great.,nan,1,ex56
expedia,Lovely hotel in a convenient location. Staff were all exceptional and willing to help the inexperienced visitor. I would definitely choose the Kinzie for a return visit.,nan,1,ex57
expedia,Great stay for New Years. Great location to bars and restaurants . Rooms were very clean and modern along with h20 products included . I would definitely stay at this location again in the future. It's about a 15 min walk from Michigan avenue. You are about 2 blocks from Dearborn street. Cabs are not an issue to get from this location. Valet service is very quick .,nan,1,ex58
expedia,Staff is always very friendly & helpful. Gold star employee of our stay is Rafi....great guy that really strives to make you feel welcome & at home!,nan,1,ex59
expedia,"Short but sweet. I was literally in the hotel for less than 12 hours but wish it was longer. The staff were very polite and the help yourself brekkie was awesome. The location was fantastic. It had a very ""Big City"" feel to it.",nan,1,ex60

expedia,Enjoyed our brief 2 day stay. Conveniently located.,nan,1,ex62
expedia,"Stayed here for the first time for 2 nights with my wife for our wedding anniversary. It is now our favorite hotel in Chicago. Location is AMAZING! Surrounded by restaurants, bars, & shopping in every direction. The Public House is right next door (great food & HUGE beer selection), Rossi's (The best 'dive bar' in the city) is right a round the corner. Harry Carey's Steakhouse is a block away. Kinzie Chop House (our favorite restaurant in Chicago) is 4 blocks west. The hotel itself is one of the cleanest I've ever stayed in. The staff was friendly & helpful. They give you complimentary drinks at their small bar on the 6th floor for every night you stay there. Plus they have a nice appetizer buffet there from 5-8 every night. My ONLY complaint is that they allow anyone in there (like kids) and there is NO TYPE of dress code required..... I'm not suggesting that a suit & tie should be required, but while we were there, there was a family of 4 that were basically having dinner at the appetizer buffet. (It's meats, cheeses, breads, etc. And NO ONE in that family was wearing shoes! They were walking around barefoot or with socks on, while everyone else there was basically dressed to go out for the evening. It was kinda gross & kinda trashy. The Kinzie Hotel is too good for that kind of behavior. But other than those particular guests, there ate absolutely NO complaints from me. We will definetly be staying there again!",nan,1,ex63
expedia,Great place & great location.,nan,1,ex64

expedia,"2 nights, great get-a-away, perfect location. Friendly staff.",nan,1,ex66
expedia,"We enjoyed our stay. The hotel is conveniently located to walk to the Chicago Theatre, Lawry's, Magnificent Mile. The room was clean and comfortable. The only very small complaint is the room door did not latch without making sure you pulled it closed and the bathroom door would not latch, but the door closed and it wasn't a problem for us. We loved the double headed shower. Beds were very comfortable. The staff was VERY friendly and available. Hope this helps your decision.",nan,1,ex67
expedia,It was my husbands and my present to each other. We stayed in the heart of downtown Chicago during the Christmas holidays. The staff was very friendly and helpful to site seeing. Was disappointed that there was a hefty charge to park our car there.,nan,1,ex68
expedia,"Hotel is nice besides the small fitness room. Also, I was double charged but that's human error. The lounge could have also been alil more appealing.",nan,1,ex69
expedia,"Loved this place. Perfect location, okay price (parking is not included), great room. Will definitely stay here again.",nan,1,ex70
expedia,Generally a good experience. Hotel is very accessible to hot spots. My only negative is that the HVAC system seemed to be always running. Nonstop slight draft through vents.,nan,1,ex71
expedia,Nice hotel with helpful staff. Very convenient location.,nan,1,ex72
expedia,Very happy with our stay and plan on coming back in the summer!,nan,1,ex73

expedia,Awesome,nan,1,ex75
expedia,"We enjoyed our stay and overall a great place to stay long term. We spent four nights and the king size bed was comfortable and the pillows divine! The location was great for walking to wonderful places to dine and shop. All the employee's were kind,friendly,very helpful, and ready to serve you. My husbands only complaint was there was no comfortable chair to relax in, instead a bar stool type chair. My complaint is they need to put an extra light in bathroom near tub and something on tub bottom so you don't slip and fall in tub. Other than these few things everything else was super!",nan,1,ex76
expedia,"Room decoration was very nice and size of the room was also more spacious than the picture. Very central location so, very close to every attraction but in the same time little away from the main street so, quite and less hectic. Very comfortable bed and pillow. Both Hot drink in a room and front desk(Hot cocoa) were very good. Breakfast was simple so little disappointed at first, but various muffin was really good taste, boiled egg and nice coffee, fruit, tazo tea ...were all good. But someone who expect a great view from the room, then should try different hotel because this hotel is surrounded and blocked by the other buildings very closely so hard to expect nice city view and only 6th story building. Overall room quality was top notch.",nan,1,ex77

expedia,"It was the most impressive value I have had at any hotel in memory. Super clean and fresh room and upscale amenities like bathrobes. Plenty of room to meet with a colleague in a regular king room. They give you two tokens for free drinks at private cocktail hour each night. The free breakfast was not only 20x better than the norm, it was available on each floor. It was so pleasant all the guests who passed by were friendlier than any other hotel bkfst, one pointed out the wooden tray in each room made taking coffee, juice and more back to your room. Friendly service and gave me free little extras I appreciated. Outstanding!",nan,1,ex84
expedia,we had made a special note that we were celebrating our engagement and 30th birthday on this short getaway. The hotel put a family with a screaming infant beside us. We had to switch rooms and hotel staff were not helpful in this matter. They ended up putting us in an even noisier area of the hotel. Coming form this industry ourselves we were disgusted at this. I would not recommend this hotel. They told us breakfast was included and it was a tiny set up right in front of the elevators - GROSS. The hotel itself is tiny.,nan,1,ex85
expedia,We normally stay in larger chain hotels; so glad we tried somewhere new. We thoroughly enjoyed everything about our stay. The hotel room had great style. The location could not have been better for exploring downtown. The staff was friendly and helpful. We will certainly stay again when in downtown Chicago.,nan,1,ex86

We were extremely pleased with our one-night stay. The concierge was very friendly and helpful. They recommended places to eat for both lunch and dinner. They were right on with their recommendations - both were amazing places to eat! We enjoyed our comfortable yet trendy room and the hotel was great for shopping on State Street, Michigan Avenue and also close to the river. My husband and I also enjoyed the lounge and a free drink from the hotel. This is one of the only hotels that I saw that still has a continental breakfast - it was fresh and just what you needed to start your day. Thanks for a great stay!",nan,1,ex104
expedia,I have nothing bad to say. I loved how modern the room was. Plenty of room for 2 people.,nan,1,ex105

expedia,"Nice experience. Room comfortable, well maintained, staff considerate and attentive. Renovation is nice although I am suspicious that some ""issues"" may be wearing masks! Caught the distinct smell of sewage on a couple of occasions. When the guest in the next room closed their shades it sounded like they were actually in my room. Gave me a start the first time I heard it. The lobby needs some work, brightened up, and the heavy floral smell is a bit overwhelming. Be prepared for street noise. Usually stay in larger hotels so on a higher floor thus busy streets not as noticeable. Kinzie is small so there were times I felt like I was in the middle of all that noise.",nan,1,ex107

expedia,"A wonderful hotel all around. Modern, casual, and newly updated. Lobby and check-in are small and informal - very efficient and friendly. Views can be hard to come by, as the hotel only occupies the first 6 floors of the building. The room was great - modern, clean, super comfortable king bed, and the H20 bath products are a great touch. The continental breakfast is great - there's one on every floor, and the room comes with a serving tray, which made for a great leisurely private brunch before noon checkout. The rooms have mini refrigerators...keep a bottle of champagne overnight and make mimosas in the morning!",nan,1,ex115

expedia,"We had booked a 3 night stay at this hotel. After one night, we left and stayed at a different, cheaper and much better hotel. The room was facing a building that was so close that wee could not keep the shades open as we would have had absolutely no privacy. The shower would not drain at all, we had water up to our ankle within 2 minutes. There was a terrible patch work done in the ceiling of the bathroom. The beds were not really comfortable either. I am shocked they would call this a Luxury room. In the lobby, they tried to make the door of the office look like modern wood. To do so, they used paper that they glued. It could almost fool you until you see the paper falling off from the top. They poorly tried to renovate an old building by going the cheap route yet make you pay highly for it.",nan,1,ex118
expedia,Everyone there was wonderful! The room was beautiful and the view was amazing. Meg was wonderful at the front desk. Thanks for an Amazing night,nan,1,ex119
expedia,"While I had seen some reviews mentioning the noise in the neighborhood I didn't think it would be that bad and we were just staying one night. Boy was I wrong. We attended an event just across the Chicago River so we were able to walk there which was very convenient.. The noise coming from within the hotel was so-so. Our room was located across the hall from some employee room (I saw inside it one time while someone was coming out) It looked like where they have supplies etc. and stuff for breakfast which they serve on each floor next to the elevators) so there was a lot of door opening and closing just across from us which was mildly annoying. However, the nightclubs just next to and behind the hotel were playing loud live music until 4:30 a.m.!! It was really really loud, and sadly I know it is not the fault of the hotel, but I used to live in Chicago in a noisy area and we ended up buying sound blocking drapes which really helped, and which I think the Kinzie should too. The staff was nice and apologetic in the morning when I mentioned how noisy and late the noise was, but I won't return there unless they can provide better sound insulation.",nan,1,ex120

expedia,"Nice, not overly spacious double room; lots of street noise. Nice cocktail reception and very convenient continental breakfast on each floor (so, no standing in line). Hard to find a place for 4 of us to eat it in our room, however. One barstool, a window seat and that's it. But the location (just north of the river, a few blocks from Michigan Ave, not far from Art Institute, Theatre District, okay walk to Magnificent Mile) made it a good pick. No restaurant on site, but several within a block in any direction. Harry Caray's across the street, House of Blues a block away. Overall, a very nice and comfortable hotel.",nan,1,ex127
expedia,"This hotel is great! Staff couldn't do enough to make your stay enjoyable. Great location, close to Magnificent Mile. Navy Pier only a 20 minute walk. Breakfast buffet was nice and handy, had lots of selection. Free cocktails on 6th floor was great!!!!!! Definitely would go back!!!!",nan,1,ex128
expedia,"Crazy expensive parking, paid $ 56 per night ,so it ended up really high. But location of the hotel great, walking distance anywhere, everywhere, Rooms are very modern, nice, clean.",nan,1,ex129
expedia,"The hotel was in a great location north of the river. Lots of night life and shopping within walking distance. The hotel was very ""modern"". The bed was comfortable, but for the expensive price of a hotel it felt a little lacking. No restaurant or bar, other than a small converted room that they turned in to a cocktail space from 5-8. Minimum bar service - basically just two hotel employees making basic drinks. Also disappointed that I paid such a high price for a hotel and still had to pay over $50 per night in parking. Breakfast was good, lots of choices. I also liked that it lasted until 10/11 am. I hate having to get up early on vacation just to make it on time to breakfast. Lastly, staff was kind but stiff. This hotel was ""nice"" but I feel it was overpriced for what it is.",nan,1,ex130
expedia,"On my last night at the kinzie while writing this. I book this hotel because it was the best value on Expedia. I made a great choice. They did a great job at renovating and making it modern. The staff is very helpful and polite. Beds are very comfy and room is spacious. The continental breakfast has a decent selection, however first two mornings there was no coffee left but after talking to the staff they quickly sent a fresh pot to my room. There is also a Kurieg in the room. I'm sure this is the same at any hotel but it can tend to be noisy outside as Chicago drivers seem to love honking their horn any chance they get. The staff will go out of their way to book dinner or attractions for you and give great recommendations. Btw... The subway is only couple blocks away North or south as your right on the red line. Rest of the lines just north. I would absolutely come back again and hope this hotel becomes more popular. The way a hotel should be.",nan,1,ex131
expedia,"The family enjoyed, we wished they have a swimming pool",nan,1,ex132
expedia,"This hotel is great for its location but the staff is extremely noisy! Every morning between 5 and 8 the maids shout at each other across the corridors slam carts and doors , shout out loud ..Impossible to get a good sleep. Even when asked to keep it quiet. Very disappointed.",nan,1,ex133
expedia,"Everything about the hotel was great. A little picky thing: They should have some sheer blinds on the windows because one can be seen from the street or nearby building especially on the lower levels if the blinds are open. Otherwise, would stay there again for sure.",nan,1,ex134
expedia,"Staff was exceptionally helpful with our request for a late check out and bag storage. Location was excellent:3 block walk to the L which made for a quick, easy trip to Wrigley Field; easy walk to everywhere else we wanted to visit.",nan,1,ex135
expedia,Terrific city lots to see and do!The river cruises are wonderful and going up the Willis tower is great.The waterfront is beautiful.,nan,1,ex136
expedia,"We arrived several hours before check-in with our luggage. We were hoping to stow our luggage until check-in time, but they happily checked us into our room early. All desk personnel were always cheerful, eager to assist, and very helpful with restaurant and entertainment recommendations. The room was elegantly furnished and clean. The location was great, within walking distance of many attractions and the ""L."" We highly recommend this hotel.",nan,1,ex137
expedia,"clean hotel, great location, friendly staff but staff made a few mistakes",nan,1,ex138
expedia,"Staff is great; very helpful. Room was clean and beds were comfortable. Having a free breakfast buffet in the a.m. was sooooooo convenient as I am not a morning person to get up early to go out to eat. Free happy hour also a huge perk as there is no on site bar. But not to worry, there a several GREAT places on the same block. Public House next store as great food and Harry Carey's across the street has good burgers. Also Bar 51 around the corner has a good happy hour. But the BEST part is the location. Can't beat it . Walked everywhere we went, even down to the Aquarium. Will def stay there again! Safe Travels!!",nan,1,ex139
expedia,Nice breakfast was provided every morning. It was set up in front of elevators on each floor. Rooms were nicely decorated. Staff in front office were helpful.,nan,1,ex140

expedia,"This hotel was outstanding! Aside from the incredible location, cleanliness, fantastic breakfast & Happy hour, Kidzie Hotel's employees made this one of the Best experiences I have had in a very long time. Everyone was friendly and made us feel like they went out of their way just for us! Megan at the front desk was so helpful on recommendations. She even helped with my dog Oreo when he got a bit too ""talkative"" in the room while we were at dinner. I would highly recommend this Hotel & can't wait to go back soon!!",nan,1,ex146
expedia,I would definitely go back to the Kinzie!,nan,1,ex147
expedia,"The room was super clean. The bed linens were crisp and clean. The towels were huge and comfy. Managers reception every night with drinks and horderves. Get there early, plenty drink but the food went fast. Yummy cookies. Helpful staff for the hotel and suggestions for site seeing. It was a relaxing atmosphere after a long days of touring.",nan,1,ex148
expedia,"Very nice modern hotel. Close to everything... mag mile, millennium park, downtown, river, lake. Great staff, very helpful. Would recommend to anyone. Stayed during Lollapolooza, no noise, amazing. Breakfast on each floor is so convenient.",nan,1,ex149

expedia,Enjoyed my stay. Friendly and knowledgeable staff. Comfortable clean room.,nan,1,ex151
expedia,Very nice staff. Walking distance to most activities. Would stay again if visiting Chicago.,nan,1,ex152
expedia,We had to change rooms after the first night of our three day stay because of the noise outside of the hotel in the street. There was extremely loud screaming in the middle of the night. The staff was responsive and did move us to a room facing the back. We really enjoyed this hotel's breakfast. It was a very nice continental breakfast available on every floor. Each room was equipped with a cute tray to bring breakfast back to the room. It was convenient and relaxing.,nan,1,ex153
expedia,"The hotel was a pleasant surprise and he staff were very friendly. The hotel was well kept and the rooms were clean and newly decorated. At check in were were given 2 drink tokens each for happy hour, we stayed 2 nights, which we used the first night as we had plans for the second night. The continental breakfast was included and was placed in the lobby on each floor. Both days we had a late start but the breakfast was still well stocked and there was a great variety of items to choose from. There is a tray in the room so you can load it up and take it to your room.",nan,1,ex154
expedia,"There are only two things about the Kinzie that I can say that are not positive. First, the pillows are not very comfortable, so bring your own from home. And the free breakfast is in my opinion not good. It is mainly donuts, pastries, sweetened yogurt and bread. There were boiled eggs and string cheese, but other than that it was very sugary. We opted to go down the street to eat at the very awesome restaurant: Lyfe Kitchen. I know lots of folks love donuts....but not my family. We prefer something a bit more healthy.",nan,1,ex155
expedia,"Room was very comfortable and centrally located for where I had to be for a conference and dinner. I'm not sure if it was because I was overly tired but, the bed was so comfortable and the staff exceptionally friendly. The hotel was really easy to get to as I took the train from ORD and walked a couple of blocks to the hotel.",nan,1,ex156
expedia,The Kinzie is a wonderful hotel in the heart of Chicago within walking distance to everything. Best continental breakfast buffet I have ever experienced provided on each floor.

expedia,Overall great experience. The staff is so friendly and helpful! The room is clean and pretty and breakfast on every floor is awesome.,nan,1,ex158
expedia,"We were there for less than 24 hours, but our experience was outstanding. Valet and bellman were great. We enjoyed the complimentary cocktail at happy hour, and the continental breakfast the next morning was outstanding (we absolutely loved the fact that it was outside the elevators on our floor which meant we could grab what we wanted and enjoy it in the room...huge bonus!). The gym was just ""okay,"" but the location was outstanding with plenty of shopping, eating and drinking within close walking distance. We would definitely stay here again.",nan,1,ex159
expedia,Had a great stay and especially loved the breakfast on each floor in the morning.,nan,1,ex160
expedia,"You couldn't ask for a better location. Easy to walk to so many Chicago attractions, and if you are not a walker, your trains are all within a few blocks. The staff at the Kinzie are sincere in wanting you to enjoy your stay. It's so nice to be able to walk down the hall for breakfast (even in your robe), and the evening reception is a fun place to mingle.",nan,1,ex161
expedia,Across from Harry Carey s & walk to Shaw s My two fav rest in chicago. Staff was friendly & helpful. Clean fresh roms with plenty of towels Not much lobby but what do you need it for?,nan,1,ex162
expedia,"Staff made us feel so very welcome. Very accomodating and always smiling. Rooms were ready early with a choice. Continental breakfast was perfect on each floor so there was enough for all. Meeting other guests to chat over a cocktail was super in the lounge after a long hot day of sightseeing, we got to compare notes of our travels. Rafi (I hope that's your name?) at the concierge desk was so attentive and nice, as was the evening concierge. Will be returning again and again to the Kinzie!",nan,1,ex163
expedia,Parking was much more than expected. $31 for less than 8 hours of self-parking was steep. The hotel offered valet parking for $56. Had we known how much parking would have cost we may have chosen an alternate hotel.,nan,1,ex164
expedia,"My wife and I flew into Chicago early on the 4th of July and were worried on what to do with our luggage. Contacted the hotel and they said they would store our bags and when we did arrive they actually had our room ready hours before check in. This was done so without me even having to ask. From start to finish of our stay was fantastic. Great hospitality, service and excellent location. Nice breakfast and a cocktail hour to boot. Usually don't take time to rate hotels but this one earned it",nan,1,ex165
expedia,Generous hospitality. No skimping. Great free breakfast and cocktail hour! Lovely room and very clean. Very nice free toiletries. Staff friendly and helpful. Nothing was too much trouble. Great location. Fabulous stay and one of my best hotel stays ever.,nan,1,ex166
expedia,"We had a great stay at the Kinzie. The breakfast was great. The rooms are larger than most downtown hotels and very comfortable. We loved having the breakfast on each floor and it was a very good breakfast. The exercise room is small, but well equipped.",nan,1,ex167

expedia,very good! good location! We would book there again.,nan,1,ex171
expedia,Stayed here with friends for 3 nights. The hotel is located in a perfect spot for visiting the city. Staff were very friendly and accommodating. Continental breakfast served on each floor was much more than the usual and very good. Evening appetizers & drinks (5-8 pm) were beyond our expectations!,nan,1,ex172
expedia,"One of the better hotels I have stayed at. Comfortable room, breakfast on each floor (like breakfast in bed), snacks and drinks in the afternoon is all someone could want from a hotel.",nan,1,ex173

expedia,Great staff and great room! Love the Double Cross lounge for enjoying a few drinks before hitting the town. Great continental breakfast. No complaints except I wish there was a pool.,nan,1,ex176
expedia,When unwrapping a cloth found it was stained and dirty...not sure the cleaning staff is as meticulous as the rest of staff. Breakfast was great . The appetizers were the same each night so a variety would be nice. Bell hops and door men were amazing and very helpful. We would stay here again when in Chicago.,nan,1,ex177

expedia,"My husband & I have stayed at several Chicago hotels & this is one of the best. Rooms are clean, nice amenities, the continental breakfast on each floor is wonderful. We also went to the manager's reception & great apps along with good cocktails. We arrived early & they did not hesitate to check us in & it was very quick. Can't beat the location, close to some great bars, food, highly recommend to stay here!",nan,1,ex181
expedia,"walking distance to most sites, shopping, restaurants, bars and tours or a short cab ride. Convenient continental breakfast on each floor outside elevator - just grab your tray in your room and have breakfast in your room. Only 6 floors of hotel rooms and the rest office - therefore no long waits for the elevator. Not the greatest view - roof of an old building straight our our huge picturesque windows but if you looked up you could see the skyscrapers . No restaurant - but free drink and appetizers everynight on the 6th floor. A small gym but no pool and it was HOT in Chicago - would have loved a pool either indoor or out.",nan,1,ex182

The Grand Red Line subway station or Merchandise Mart ""L"" stations are not far. It is a nice walk to the Loop and Magnificent Mile. There is a free trolley to Navy Pier where there was a great fireworks show on Saturday night. There are lots of restaurants close by. The Weber Grill on State St. is good. Check out the Oak Street Beach and Oak Street shopping. Take the bus to Coal Fire Pizza. Take the Red Line to Wriggly Field for a tour and to see the Million Dollar Quartet on Lincoln Ave. The breakfast on each floor was nice. There is a refrigerator and safe in the room.

expedia,"This hotel is incredible. From the moment you step in, they think of anything you need. A cocktail on the house every evening along with hors d'oevres, fruit infused water with chocolate chip cookies and the continental breakfast on every floor - you are treated like royalty! I wish I would have brought my workout gear - the gym has all the equipment you will need. And they are pet friendly making you feel like you are home with your pup. I will be back when I visit Chicago for pleasure!",nan,1,ex195

expedia,Good hotel close to mag mile and river. Well presented and did me fine.,nan,1,ex197
expedia,"I called the hotel to ask about pets and the lady had an attitude; when we arrived, the staff was friendly including housekeeping on the 6th floor. Continental breakfast was good each morning; nothing like resorts but it has your basic options. Our view was nice; location was awesome! The room was clean and comfortable; my only complaint is the white robe they provided had yellowish stains all over it and I didn't notice until I put it on and I wanted to vomit.",nan,1,ex198
expedia,"I love this hotel!! The staff is always very knowledgeable, helpful, and courteous, from front desk staff (where you get to take a seat to check in!) to room service to housekeeping. When I wanted to order a deep dish (not offered through room service), the gentleman at the front desk rushed up a menu to his local favorite joint. The room was extremely comfortable, from the bedding to the additional furniture, such as the settee next to the window. I will always stay at the Kinzie.",nan,1,ex199
expedia,"Great location, wonderful staff! The Happy Hour is a definite bonus! Would stay here again!",nan,1,ex200
expedia,"I would recommend this hotel as it is excellent for the price. Rooms are clean , staff friendly , and location is perfect,, not what I consider luxury but very good for business if you not spending too much time in your room. Not good restaurants or bars in the place but with its location why would you need that.. Best things is the complementary breakfast served on your floor ,, great idea and very very convienent .",nan,1,ex201

expedia,Thoroughy enjoyed our weekend at Kinzie. Located in a great location in River North. Great staff - friendly. No complaints at all.,nan,1,ex205
expedia,"We stayed at a Westin hotel a few days before moving to this hotel. We found the overall quality to be lower than a Westin hotel. The location was great, the staff were friendly, and the hotel had a nice feel to it. However, the overall feel was inferior to a Westin brand, including cleanliness, quality of bed, towels, etc.",nan,1,ex206
expedia,"Loved the hotel!!!! Good location, staff very friendly ! Only thing was amenities priced a little high, but that is all over! I would definitely come & stay there again!!!",nan,1,ex207
expedia,"Friendly staff, the young guy at reception always had a welcoming smile. Room was excellent, great size with lovely big windows. Perhaps the option of some voile to pull across window for a little more privacy may be preferable for some thou, rather than having to block out the light by pulling the blinds down. The complimentary breakfast was spot on and was amazed to find gluten free cereal which is rarely on a buffet breakfast which you have to pay for, we'll done!! Great location, got the train from the airport and the stop was only a couple of blocks from the hotel. If returning to Chicago I wouldn't hesitate to book this hotel again. Keep up the good work!!",nan,1,ex208
expedia,"I checked into the Kinzie for the Sweets and Snacks Expo that was going on that week. Upon my first step into the hotel, I knew something was wrong the night desk manager, gave me a solemn glance. ( i knew something was wrong) he asked, are you Mr. H? I responded why YES! yes I am. the next few minutes were a whirlwind of information. but at the end of it. I had no room. They had overbooked my room. But to credit of the hotel and its staff, they went above and beyond in trying to make this right.( they gave me the room the following two nights & comped one of the nights as well) I credit the hotel staff in making a terrible situation bearable and going out of there way to make up for the mistake. I would stay at this hotel again, solely for the high level of customer service provided. the rooms themselves were great, the beds comfortable. The hotel is centrally located near restaurants and the booming night scene. The hotel lobby could use some work, but the rooms themselves compare to the W's. where I normally stay. Jake especially was great at handling all of this. He is someone that should be given a raise & promotion for how he expertly handled a difficult situation.",nan,1,ex209
expedia,"I loved the snack buffet every night, the breakfast buffet was good too, it was just missing eggs, bacon, fruit salad and hot chocolate. I kind of like the fact that you can grab your food and eat in your room, but it's not convenient when you are a big group. The room was good, but the rolling shower not that great. Room was clean, they had a mini fridge were you could store food and drinks which is great. The service was great, we had to deal with great and understandable people. The location is also great, close to the loop and navy pier, it's really central. I will definitely come back.",nan,1,ex210
expedia,"The staff was spectacular. They were extremely knowledgeable of the area restaurants, sights, and the subway system. There was a breakfast each morning that consisted of various pastries and a cocktail social in the evening that included drinks and food. The food consisted of meats and cheeses with toasts among other things. It was perfect to go with a glass of wine or cocktail before heading out to dinner. I almost always stay at higher end hotels, so I've slept in many comfortable hotel beds before. This one was no exception. It may have even been the most comfortable bed I've ever slept in at a hotel. The hotel is conveniently located close to the subway and is within walking distance (1 - 1.5 miles) of plenty attractions. I tend to enjoy walking when I visit cities. I feel as though I get to see more that way. The Chicago Symphony Center, Millennium Park, plenty of restaurants, and shopping along Magnificent Mile are all within a 15-30 minute walk. If you'd rather take the subway, there is a station two blocks away that can get you to any of those places within a few minutes for $10/day unlimited riding. My next trip to Chicago will most likely include a stay at the Kinzie Hotel.",nan,1,ex211
expedia,Enjoyed the hotel and the great location to local hot spots,nan,1,ex212
expedia,To stayed in the corner room. It was ok not as good as they hyped it up to be. But the staff was nice and friendly,nan,1,ex213
expedia,"This is a great hotel - close to everything without an outrageous price tag. The rooms have all been nicely renovated and overall, it has a nice feel to it. Check in was a little chaotic but we were able to get into our room early, though we sacrificed room size to do so. My only true complaint was that housekeeping cleaned my room while I was away, and threw away a large bag of homemade cookies I had brought along for my Chicago friends. Not sure if they thought I had checked out already or what, but it was a disappointment!",nan,1,ex214
expedia,"Great hotel perfect location, was impressed with how helpful and courteous the staff was, will definitely be back when vacationing in Chicago again.",nan,1,ex215

Perfect location to see downtown Chicago! Nice, clean and comfortable room! Beds were very comfortable, slept well! Loved having a complimentary breakfast located on each floor! Delicious options! Also enjoyed the nightly reception with appetizers and soft drinks! Highly recommend this hotel!! Offered 3 different free newspapers every day we were there. Nice fitness center! I give the Kinzie an A+!!",nan,1,ex216

expedia,"Decided to stay here for a night while visiting Chicago. Location is great, we walked everywhere, but valet parking was expensive. Room was clean with a nice view of the city. Minibar and trays with water bottles are sensor based, so if you even touch it, you might get charged. Otherwise, no complaints.",nan,1,ex219
expedia,"Bed was clearly old or broken as it dipped in center and caused back ache. T.v. didn't work until 3rd day they fixed it. Phone rang randomly twice a day, waking me up. Too many hotels in Chicago to choose from. Although the staff waa friendly and otherwise service was good. I'd stay somewhere else next time. It is definitely a convention hotel (I seemed to be only person there not in a suit and name tag). The bar is huge and gets quite busy/ jammin for a hotel bar which was entertaining. Cocktails weren't cheap ($20 martini)",nan,1,ex220
expedia,"It felt like Atlanta or Houston rather than Chicago. Your first impression when you enter is that it's huge, impersonal, and noisy. It's particularly pedestrian-unfriendly, which is strange for Chicago: to enter the hotel from Wacker Drive, you need to basically walk through a parking lot. The staff was fine, as was the room. But next time I'm staying in the Loop, I'll get a smaller, cozier place, e.g., Club Quarters/River or Monaco.",nan,1,ex221
expedia,I had a King Bed Ada Tub room but the guy gave me a 2 queen bed room. The in-room air conditioner was a bit noisy.,nan,1,ex222

expedia,"I had booked a rate that included breakfast. Upon check-in, they wouldn't let me remove the breakfast upgrade. It was a bit disappointing, but the breakfast was fantastic!",nan,1,ex224
expedia,"My husband and I stayed at this hotel from 5/8/15-5/10/15. The staff was excellent. Our King room was spacious and newly remodeled. The only issue we immediately noticed is that the walls are quite thin. There was a family in the room next to us and we could hear their children whenever they were in the room. In all the hotels I've stayed in, I've never experienced walls so thin. Also, whenever people were talking in the hallways...it sounded as if they were in your room. On the other hand, this hotel couldn't be in a better location! It is right on the Magnificent Mile, countless restaurants, navy pier, Millennium Park and lots more. If you can get past the thinness of the walls, then this is honestly an excellent place to stay!",nan,1,ex225
expedia,Close to everything! It was also nice to have options for food and drinks inside the hotel.,nan,1,ex226

expedia,we were able to walk to every attraction from this well-situated hotel. no complaints about our stay at all. large fitness center was a plus for me!,nan,1,ex230
expedia,"This is my second stay in three months, the first for the American Library Association convention and the second for Society of Midland Authors conference. I had no idea that the second conference was being held at the same time as the NFL Draft celebration. So the city was congested. The Hyatt was like an oasis, well at the edge of all the activity. Check-in was a breeze, there is always a staff member helping to expedite the line. The gentleman who checked me in was pleasant and, even though I arrived well before check-in, put me in a quiet room after he discovered I'd been traveling since 5am. My room, a king deluxe in the West Tower was comfortable, and meticulously clean. The linens and towels were crisp white. The bathroom was sparkling. I wouldn't advise a car - parking is expensive. Instead I arrived via airport shuttle and took cabs or buses to my desired locations. Breakfast in the morning was well prepare (although I do miss the Panna Cotta they served in January). One note - during the buffet there was an odd meat everyone was avoiding - it was labeled ""kielbasa"" but looked like bland oval potato cakes. That was a ""miss."" Otherwise the buffet had plenty of excellent options including smoked salmon and made to order omelets. The waiters were attentive The location on Wacker is perfect, close to Grant Park, only 2 blocks from Michigan avenue, and a short trip over to Navy Pier. What's not to like? For future trips, this will be my top choice in Chicago.",nan,1,ex231
expedia,"Great location! Right on the Chicago river, walkin distance from the Navy Pier, the Bean and the Magnificent Mile.",nan,1,ex232
expedia,"This hotel is in a great location in a central position for the Loop and the Mag Mile. The staff are very friendly and helpful and the food was delicious. The room was lovely, clean and spacious. The only thing I would say is the lobby area is very large and impersonal, but this is a minor point and could be a positive to some people. I would highly recommend this hotel for business or tourists.",nan,1,ex233
expedia,"We had a fantastic stay. The checkin/out process was extremely easy, staff very accommodating, and the hotel was gorgeous. The only complaint was the price of parking my vehicle there overnight, but it was expected. The staff was very prompt to have my car ready whenever needed. We were able to check out at noon, pack my vehicle, and keep the vehicle at the hotel while we explored the city, which was really nice since we didn't have to worry about parking somewhere for the day",nan,1,ex234

expedia,"Was disappointed when we arrived that rooms we reserved online were not available. One of us had to sleep on the floor the first night since no roll away beds were available either. Not sure why you reserve rooms and pay with credit card if they are not available. The second night of our stay I had to call and ask for roll away bed and was told they have one they will give us at no charge, making the second night a little more comfortable. Location was great. Restaurants in hotel were over priced for food you received.",nan,1,ex243
expedia,"Nice central location, clean newly renovated rooms. Beds are OK, nothing like my Duxiana at home. Parking is crazy expensive ($63/day), more than my rental car.",nan,1,ex244
expedia,My girlfriend and I visited Chicago for 4 nights at the Hyatt Regency Chicago. It was a really nice hotel in a great location. The only bad thing I can say about this hotel is that the walls are pretty thin and you can hear people talking in the hallways. All in all I would definitely stay here again.,nan,1,ex245
expedia,"Hotel is beautiful expecially bars and lobby. Bed was comfortable but could never sleep well because we would wake up sweating. We turned air down as far as possible (65) but it apparently didn't work and just couldn't get any air circulation in the room. It was 40-50 degrees outside and we would sweat in our room with the AC on. Also don't request a fridge in your room because they don't tell you that it costs $25 but thankfully took it off our bill because we were not aware and didnt even end up using it. Don't drink at the Big Bar. Drinks are very watered down and nothing but sugar (because they are so big), but food is very delicious.",nan,1,ex246

expedia,"For a hotel with the Hyatt Regency name on it, I was very disappointed. I was expecting more. Not anything major was wrong but a lot of little things added together made the stay worse than it should have been. 1. The in-room safe. This is the first hotel I've stayed in for a long time where the in-room safe was NOT laptop compatible. A person assumes that when the hotel website mentions a safe in the room that it's laptop compatible...99.9 percent of them are these days since almost everyone travels with a laptop. I have a little 13"" Macbook and it was twice as big as the safe. And this is supposed to be a business hotel with the Illinois Center next to it. 2. The room was arranged all wrong. Couldn't even watch TV without hurting my neck sitting on the bed or getting a sore tailbone due to the very very very uncomfortable chairs. Also, they are using a universal hotel remote for the TV as most hotels do but on this one, half the buttons didn't work. 3. The Marketplace (for quick snacks and coffee) was really expensive. A small cup of coffee and a pastry costs more than at Starbucks, and that's saying a lot. 4. Had to ask to have the ""complimentary"" toiletries in the bathroom replaced. Shouldn't have had to do that. 5. WiFi was very unreliable. Sometimes it worked great and other times, no go. Like I said at the beginning, nothing major but put all of these pet peeves together and it's makes for a bad stay.",nan,1,ex252
expedia,"This is a very nice hotel with many offerings. However, parking is extremely expensive!!",nan,1,ex253
expedia,"We had a great time overall, the only downfall was the doormen threatening to tow our car because it wasn't parked in the right spot. Maybe you should have more signs up as to where to park when your guests are checking in. First time ever that I've had a hotel threaten to tow my vehicle when I wasn't parked in the right spot. Needless to say they didn't see a penny worth of tip money on the whole trip. Otherwise it was a great hotel.",nan,1,ex254
expedia,"I was in Chicago to visit a friend and booked the Hyatt on E Wacker not sure of the area and I'm so glad I did. Close to everything! From Garretts Popcorn to the Shattuck Aquarium, it was all within walking distance.",nan,1,ex255
expedia,"I was offered an upgrade for an extra $20 a night and was so glad I said yes. I couldn't stop looking out the window at the beautiful city lights. Travelling solo, the location was perfect! The room was clean and the bed super comfy!",nan,1,ex256
expedia,Our bathroom wasn't clean front said they would clean it right away. They didn't I had to clean it. The bath tub was full of hair. It was nasty.,nan,1,ex257
expedia,"I went to Chicago only two days with my family. We loved the hotel, it is modern, comfortable and the staff is kind. The only issue that we had is that we were 3 adults and they gave us a 1 bed room.",nan,1,ex258
expedia,"There was a card that stated, put down what you need from the cleaning people. I put down needed a razor from day one and never got it. I wonder if my ""care card"" will be the same for the next guest.",nan,1,ex259
expedia,"I didn't let it affect my review because everything about the hotel was excellent! Breakfast, staff, room, view, bar, location--everything was great. I personally like the location for proximity to millennium park and north Michigan ave, right in the middle of both. My only ""buyer beware"" / negative was the fidge / snack bar in the room. Im not blaming Hyatt as it's my own stupidity, but $11 for a small can of peanuts!? Come on man.....! Spent $52 on just a couple beers and some peanuts. Byob..",nan,1,ex260
expedia,"I want to show the hotel's parktodaying aria front oh the hotel. I made a resevation ""two queen beds"". But when I cheked in the hotel, staff asked me ""would you like one bouble bed?"" I answerd him,""No! I made a reservetion two queen beds."" He said to me ""Your room is a one king bed."" I stayed one king bed. I could'nt understand why the staff asked me one double bed and why I stayed differebnt room.",nan,1,ex261

expedia,"Very clean, staff was extremely friendly and helpful, and the breakfast buffet at American Craft was fantastic. Plus or 6 year old got to eat free, always a plus.",nan,1,ex267
expedia,We visited Chicago for a family weekend and were nicely surprised by this property that is in heart of Chicago and walking distance to Millenium Park and all the great shopping on Michigan Ave. we got a great rate and so it made sense to be there!,nan,1,ex268
expedia,"Affordable price good location. Large hotel but wasn't noisy. Room was clean, a bit hot (even with AC on full blast). ""3 days in Chicago"" Must do activities - Magnificent Mile, Cloud Gate, Millenium Park, Lincoln Zoo all FREE. 360 Chicago (19 USD per adult) great views. Drive to Toyota Park to watch a MLS soccer game. Catch a baseball game if possible. Must try bars: The Drifter (secret entrance - basement of The Green Door Tavern at bottom of stairs behind the bookshelf). They have burlesque/entertainment for $5 cover at scattered times throughout the night. It's a very casual but intimate bar with great cocktails and snacks. Booze Box (basement of Sushi Dokku on W Randolf Street). Wasn't a huge fan of the popular restaurants - Girl and Goat , Little Goat...I'd say stick to other areas of Chicago, Randolf street was a bit pretentious (similar to Toronto's King West but smaller).",nan,1,ex269
expedia,All the staff was friendly and professional and quick,nan,1,ex270
expedia,Booked this hotel at the last minute and it was wonderful. Great central location. A little hard to find the underground parking because my cell phone kept losing reception under the bridge. Room and all of the hotel facilities were top notch. It is a huge hotel but the staff were able to handle it and were very helpful and accommodating. There's a great small Italian restaurant with deep dish pizza right around the corner.,nan,1,ex271
expedia,"We are in the center courtyard restaurant a lot. On the nights they had buffets, the food was amazing! Great buffet menu and price. Great staff there too! Sterlings was extremely overpriced.",nan,1,ex272
expedia,"I was only there for one night on a business trip. The single king room was quite spacious and comfortable. There was an issue with the cable when I got back to my room that evening, but the front desk sent someone right away (even called back to verify that they arrived and fixed the issue) and it was repaired quickly.",nan,1,ex273
expedia,"My stay in Hyatt Regency Chicago was very pleasant. Staff was super supportive. The room was very nice and clean.

expedia,Hotel was very clean and has excellent views from rooms,nan,1,ex275
expedia,"Overall, I had a very good experience at the Hyatt. The lobby, sitting areas, and restaurants are all top notch. I appreciated the underground connection to various eateries during the cold winter days. The staff members are very friendly. The gym facility, although somewhat small, was very clean and I appreciated the towel service (and the free apples on occasion!). The room was small, but cozy. However, I did have some problems sleeping due to the fluttering noise of the fan.",nan,1,ex276
expedia,It was easy to book our stay. We got a room within 10 min of arrival at the hotel. Stay was comfortable as room was spacious having all amenities one may require. Booking out was simple. Hotel facilities were comfortable.,nan,1,ex277
expedia,"Great location and nice lobby. Wide open space, feels like you are outside, great lobby bar. We at at restaurant and the service was awful. We were told we couldn't order breakfast/brunch at 11:02am on Sunday morning as it was now ""lunch hour."" They then said they would make an exception and gave us the breakfast menus but pushed the $26 buffet. When we opted for bagel sandwiches instead of the buffet that had been sitting out we were told that due to the exception we could only order the buffet or the basic two eggs and toast. We opted for the second option and desite our annoyance the food itself was good. The server came over to apologize for his changing story and proceeded to not pay attention and pour coffee on my eggs. When we were ready to leave we asked another server for the check as ours had disappeared and we were told we needed to tell our server....Shortly after we went to the valet to pick up our car that we had called 25 minutes prior to for and were told they were busy and we'd just have to wait....Nice hotel, don't expect 4 star service.",nan,1,ex278

expedia,No problems......everything was very nice. We enjoyed our stay.,nan,1,ex281
expedia,The staff were very helpful and friendly. The hotel has been refurbished recently so everything looked very new. The room was very big and there was a desk with a chair plus another a pair of leather covered seats. The room was clean. Some people might be put off by the cost but you do get what you pay for. There was plenty of staff around when I checked in and out so I didn't have to wait. I had several excellent meals in the hotel restaurant. I wanted to find out how to get to Lincoln Park zoo and the concierge was very helpful. The hotel is alongside the Chicago River and very close to the Trump Tower and really easy to find. I needed to borrow a pair of scissors and the hotel was pleased to oblige. I had reason to spend one more night in Chicago the following week and stayed at the hotel again.,nan,1,ex282
expedia,Loved it amazingly beautiful enjoyed my stay there and will be back soon!!!,nan,1,ex283
expedia,"We were in Chicago for one night. Booked here because we planned to shop Mag Mile and then shops along State Street. Hotel is located perfectly within walking distance between both. Fun atmosphere, very helpful staff, comfy bed! Work out facility is great, fun bar and relaxing sitting areas with great views.",nan,1,ex284
expedia,"The hotel is nice & our room was clean, but they charged me $5.30 for a water which we didnt drink so I had to call & have the charge reversed. Also, we valeted our car. The valet card suggested you give them 15-20 minutes to bring your car around. I called down at 10:45 AM for my car. We went to get car about 15 minutes later. We ended up waiting an hour for the car & I spoke to 3 different valet employees, but they couldnt find my car. I was in a hurry to leave & didnt check my car when they finally brought it. It has a dent in drivers side rear door & I cant get them to call me back to addresd the issue.",nan,1,ex285

The clerk asked if we were there for a conference and we replied , no girls weekend for my 50th birthday! The breakfast buffet was wonderful! It was included in our package! The concierge was fabulous with info about where to watch the St Patricks Day Parade! Staff was friendly! Can't wait to go back!",nan,1,ex287
expedia,"Overpriced and not worth the pay especially for what we are getting in return. They placed some snacks next to the television and it wasn't clear that eating those will cost us 50 dollars (for literally 1 M&M, 1 small Pringles, and one small box of cookies). The ground was also not very clean and there were clipped nails on the ground from a prior guest. Definitely didn't meet our expectations.",nan,1,ex288
expedia,"The hotel lobby and restaurant was LOUD due to some tile work and drilling, not a very relaxing environment! But will look nice when it's done. Room was just fine, serviceable and clean.",nan,1,ex289

expedia,"Hotel was pretty good. Within 5 minutes walk to Millennium Park, and a short stroll in to downtown for shopping attractions.

Great service, and would definitely stay here again.",nan,1,ex296
expedia,"Went to Chicago for work and brought my kids and a babysitter. Everyone was pleased with it. I had my clients meet me there and they commented how nice the hotel was too. Would love to go back to the hotel. Only issue was the ice machine wasn't working on our level, but they quickly brought me ice when I told them.",nan,1,ex297
expedia,$10.81 for a bottle of water in your room. $63.00 a day to park your vehicle. A little much for a city with the highest crime rate.,nan,1,ex298

expedia,"Comfortable Hotel close to the Millenium Park. Room big and clean with most important things available, but not very unique.",nan,1,ex300
expedia,We attended a dance competition for my granddaughters dance studio. The great location and the accommodations made this a good place to stay. We found alternate parking at Millenium Park ($25/day) to offset the hotel parking of ($65/day) just a ten minute walk.,nan,1,ex301

expedia,We had a cozy room with a beautiful view of the river and skyline. Almost everything was pretty much within walking distance or it was incredibly easy to grab a cab from the front of our hotel. The conceriege was very helpful and gave great recommendations.,nan,1,ex307

expedia,Our radio didn't work our bed sheets had pet hair the room Smelled like someone had been smoking in it there house keeping bothered us hours before Check out time and the expensive horrible breakfast buffet sucked and all They offered to accommodate the horrible night was more Reward points this place really Down graded,nan,1,ex309
expedia,Everything was amazing from the simplicity of checking in and out as well as the layout of the facility. The only unsatisfying experience was ordering a cheesecake togo from American Craft Kitchen and Bar. The bartenders helped everyone except me and I sat there for atleast ten minutes. I have served and been a bar back for three years so I am far from being an inpatient person. Two bartenders serving a bar that seats proably 20 people should have beable to help me much sooner especially if a couple sits next to me and gets service in 30 seconds.,nan,1,ex310
expedia,Very good experience. Would stay at the Hyatt Regency again.,nan,1,ex311

expedia,"Recently stayed at the Hyatt Regency during the American Library Conference. I read the reviews here and on TripAdvisor that suggested if I had purchased a discounted room I'd get a closet size room. I took a chance anyway and did a blind bid on Expedia for a four star hotel at a reduced rate. I couldn't be more pleased. I received a large king size room on a quiet floor. The bathroom was meticulous. The bedroom was spacious. We ate breakfast each morning in the restaurant and it was comprehensive including omelettes, multiple egg dishes, bacon, pancakes, kielbasa, smoked salmon, the usual breakfast fare replenished frequently, fresh fruits and yogurt, oatmeal, more pastries than I can count and a large cereal bar. Be still my heart - they offered Panna Cotta for breakfast. It was fabulous. During the snowstorm (also the night of the Super Bowl) they offered a buffet for a bargain price which was pretty large had multiple meat and vegetable options, salad, three soups, and a full desert bar. Internet in the room is for purchase. We used the access in the lobby instead. It was fast and free for hotel guests. Don't take a car. Parking is expensive. Taxi's to get around is less expensive. If you take the subway it is about a 10 minute walk from the Lake stop. Would definitely stay here again",nan,1,ex322

Staff were welcoming and accommodating, putting me in a quiet room in my requested tower, and then, when the 'blizzard of 2015' hit great with advice for where to eat and how to get around (or not, for those people whose flights were cancelled or delayed.) This will definitely be my first choice for my next trip back to Chicago.",nan,1,ex324

expedia,We really enjoyed our stay here. The staff were very friendly and helpful with anything from answering general questions to their recommendations on things to do and places to eat. The only issue we had is we paid extra money to go up a few floors and get a better view but the view was only good if you were right at the window. There was one chair but no room for another which would have been nice since there were two of us and a toddler. The rest of the view in the room was of the two building next to us. We were so tired from driving all night we didn't push the issue but wasn't what we expected. Other than that we would definitely stay there again.,nan,1,ex327

Pros: comfortable, clean, good price (stayed in Jan.), good cafe downstairs with reasonable prices for breakfast. Cons: $63 per overnight parking! We parked elsewhere and walked back to the hotel - seriously. And, the sign says they care about conserving water - so I hung up my one towel and bathmat, which meant they should have left them alone. They changed them anyway. Not so committed.",nan,1,ex346

expedia,"We booked this trip last minute for New Years Eve 2015 so 0 research was done for our stay. I am happy to state that we were more than happy with the staff, service and the over hotel. We did have some problems with checking in, that caused us to be charged twice for the room. Our credit card showed declined so we paid cash, upon checking out this was noticed and we were refunded the difference. Also small issues with the room it had not been updated in some time other than an Ipod docking station. The room could have been cleaned better but had been surface cleaned (lots of dust on head boards tv etc.). Over all we were happy with the stay.",nan,1,ex354
expedia,"Great friendly staff. Very polite, courteous and everyone greeted you :)",nan,1,ex355
expedia,"The neighbourhood is REALLY awesome: you really get to access many of the Chicago's most famous attractions within walking range, like SkyDeck, Millennium Park, Mag Mile, Theatre District etc.",nan,1,ex356
expedia,"It's a big hotel in walking distance of all main attractions, such as Magnificent Mile, Navy Pier, Art Institute, Millennium park, several theaters; we even walked to the museum campus. However it's a 7 minute walk to the blue line subway station. It was very cold when we stayed there last time, and I would prefer to have station a bit closer. As in other more expensive hotels, one has to pay for internet access and for parking. We stayed in a room with two queen size beds, which were pretty comfortable. There was no fridge in the room. Otherwise all amenities were provided. There is a small convenience store in the hotel (in the east building) where one can buy fruits and drinks. Or one can just cross the river and find everything in Walgreens.",nan,1,ex357
expedia,Excellent price for room and breakfast buffet added. Great view without needing the upgrade upcharge. Would definitely stay there again!,nan,1,ex358
expedia,"This was a getaway trip. From check in to concierge and bell captain, everyone was wonderful. In particular, the help and guidance from the concierge was outstanding! They found a great jazz club and immediately set up a reservation and made it smooth and easy to get there and enjoy. Other directions and guiding advice made this a delightful trip.",nan,1,ex359
expedia,Excellent location for the price. Visited during winter maybe price was low due to the season,nan,1,ex360
expedia,"We stayed New Year's Eve. The hotel in general is very nice, elegant lobby, things to do near by. However, our room, was very cold! This is winter in Chicago, we stayed on the 9th floor with a view of the city. Yet, the huge windows in the room basically made the heat not work. We called the mechanic to come fix the system, but it was still cold, we slept with many layers on till it finally warmed up. I would recommend requesting a room not on the exterior.",nan,1,ex361
expedia,"Well, the hotel is nice and the location is perfect. This was my second time staying there.. and we had a blast. The hotel is like a little city and is very entertaining. Room service was cheap and the staff was friendly. Unfortunately though, the hotel tried charging me outrageous fees at checkout. I was charged a $59 valet charge wihich made no sense because I didn't have a car! Plus we booked a room for 4 adults and was given a great rate through hotels.com. At the end of our stay, the hotel said we owed an additional $50 a night for the extra adults in the room. All that said, the hotel waived the fees after arguing with them for 20 minutes, but I was still disappointed it happened. I felt that this must happen alot because the guy acted like it wasn't a big deal and didn't seem to care I was upset this wasnt disclosed before checkout. Debating if we'll stay there again, which is unfortunate because it really is a nice place in a good location in downtown chicago.",nan,1,ex362
expedia,Nice-convenient location! Easy access to downtown! Highly recommended!,nan,1,ex363
expedia,Carpet in room was filthy there was so many Cheerios behind the doors as if no one had vacuumed the room. Side table dusty window not cleaned moved side chair in room only to find no one have moved it for a while dust stain around it room over all small n dirty. Floor was not even their was bumps throughout the floor. Staff was extremely nice and courteous,nan,1,ex364
expedia,Pricey valet but otherwise everything was wonderful.,nan,1,ex365
expedia,"Stay was ok, extra tight security on New Years. Room wasn't prepared properly, lotion and soap were used.",nan,1,ex366
expedia,I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone. The room was very spacious with a big bathroom and a big window with a great view. The staff was extremely helpful. The one downfall is they don't have a mini fridge. Just a heads up don't take out or move anything in the mini bar. It has a sensor and you will be charged. I was very impressed and will definitely be staying there again.,nan,1,ex367
expedia,"We stayed at the hotel for New Year's Eve. Loved it! We were very impressed with how seamless the experience was from check-in, to the service we experienced at the ""Big Bar"" and concierge desk by Renee, the security check point (which was extra due to New Year's Eve) and check-out. The location is great and we had an awesome view of the river from our room! We would definitely recommend this stay to others!",nan,1,ex368
expedia,"Hotel had a very nice, open feel with lots of options for food- even for a vegan which isn't always the case. Room was nice and spacious. Staff very helpful and friendly. Very satisfied. Would book again.",nan,1,ex369
expedia,"This is our third time staying here. Great customer service, clean rooms, nice location! This is one of my favorite hotels in Chicago.",nan,1,ex370
expedia,"My stay at the Hyatt Regency was absolutely amazing. I went there on New Years Eve to celebrate my birthday with friends. When arriving we received wristbands to enter the elevators to our room, safety reasons. I thought that was acceptable since it was on such a busy night for everyone in the city. The room was spacious and clean. The only thing is unless you are willing to pay extra do not touch anything in the fridge or on the front table. The view was nice! All in all, it was a well spent getaway! Thanks",nan,1,ex371
expedia,unplanned girls road trip to Chicago .. loved the hotel and would stay there again..,nan,1,ex372
expedia,"Our room was very small and had an overwhelming musty and mildewed smell, like the carpets had been cleaned and not fully dried. For a hotel rated excellent, it was a disappointment. We will look elsewhere next time we stay in Chicago.",nan,1,ex373
expedia,Excelente,nan,1,ex374
expedia,"My first experience at the Hyatt was a fantastic one! i will definitely be staying again. The staff was incredibly helpful, and check in was a breeze. A great place to spend a night in a beautiful city!",nan,1,ex375
expedia,Staff was helpful and accomedating. Great location.,nan,1,ex376
expedia,"THIS WAS A GREAT EXPERIENCE WE DID ENJOY IT VERY MUCH. ONLY A COUPLE OF COMMENTS, THEY DID NOT PROVIDE ON A DAILY BASIS THE SOAP AND SHAMPOO, THE INTERNET WAS ALSO NOT INCLUDED AND THERE WAS A DAILY CHARGE FOR IT AND I CONSIDER FOR THE PRICE OF THE ROOM THIS IS A MUST, AND TO BE HONEST I DID NOT REMEMBER IF WHEN I DID THE RESERVATION, THE BREACKFAST WAS INCLUDED AND IT WAS NOT",nan,1,ex377
expedia,Staff were very helpful the hotel was very clean ... in I felt very safe,nan,1,ex378
expedia,"We had a great week together here. I think it's normally a business hotel, but it served us very nicely. Nice fitness room, comfortable bed, very low noise. More than one restaurant in the hotel. And everyone we talked to, front desk, waiters, house keeper, were all very nice and helpful.",nan,1,ex379
expedia,This hotel is beautiful and the location is excellent. The beds have luxurious pillow tops. The bathrooms are beautifully lit. The view of the river was amazing!,nan,1,ex380
expedia,"loved this hotel! It was close to everything we wanted to do. Nice lobby bar to unwind at after shopping. Even though the hotel is huge, the rooms are quiet. Rain and sleet forced us to take more cabs/Uber rides but due to location even those were all very reasonable. Definitely will go back.",nan,1,ex381
expedia,"The only bad thing was the ""24 hour"" store closed at 10:00pm. I had to go to Walgrees or wait for room service to bring water. Other than that, very nice and comfortable hotel!",nan,1,ex382
expedia,Simply Perfect,nan,1,ex383
expedia,"Perfectly located with easy walking distance to everything. It was clean, nice and beds were comfortable. The bar is fantasticWe were in the West tower without a view, but we also spent very little time in our room, so it didn't really matter. In general a good hotel for the money.",nan,1,ex384
expedia,cleanliness of room,nan,1,ex385
expedia,"Great view of downtown and good location near Michigan avenue. Staff were very attentive, friendly and helpful. Room was spacious and quiet",nan,1,ex386
expedia,"This is one of the best Chicago hotels we've stayed in, and we have stayed in many of them over the years. We are impressed by the fact that in spite of being a huge hotel, it has managed to be friendly and cozy. All staff members are obviously taught to be friendly and caring with guests and that tells us that the management is really professional. We love the fact the there is room service 24 hours a day... our kids really loved it. It gives a feeling of luxury and relaxation. The location is obviously perfect and close to all activities in town (being basically in the middle of mag mile). This will be our choice next time we come back to Chicago.",nan,1,ex387
expedia,"We went for a family Staycation to the city to enjoy the holiday decorations, ice skating at Millenium Park, the Blackhawks store, and good deep dish Chicago Pizza. This location was an easy walk to everything we wanted to enjoy.",nan,1,ex388
expedia,Great location and near every point of interest in the Windy City.,nan,1,ex389
expedia,"The hotel was excellent and in a great location. The only negative was that the bed was not the most comfortable, a little hard for our taste. Otherwise, everything was spot on--service, cleanliness, amenities.",nan,1,ex390
expedia,The overall stay could have been better if the staff was friendlier. The front desk was rude and after paying for our hotel room we were charged for wristbands to get back into the hotel we had already paid for. When asking an employee who was doing nothing to take our groups picture they gave us a nasty look and acted as if we were asking them a huge imposition.,nan,1,ex391
expedia,Thought we were getting a room with a view of the river high up (the REASON we booked the hotel)but got a room on the third floor with a view of a side road. Would also have liked the option to carry our own bags to our room. Parking was very expensive but it was a good location for shopping.,nan,1,ex392
expedia,Very friendly staff. Very accommodating. Wonderful views of Lake Michigan. Comfortable mattresses.,nan,1,ex393
expedia,"We had a wonderful time! Hotel was clean, quiet and close to many restaurants. Walking distance to many shops!!!!",nan,1,ex394
expedia,"The hotel is conveniently located in walking distance to Millenium Park and Michigan Ave. We ordered room service one night it was good and quick. The only downside was our room was so cold, they sent a technician up right away to take a look but that was no help...aside from that the hotel was great room size, views, and comfy beds",nan,1,ex395
expedia,"'Smooth check in & out. Actually, got our room at 12 noon. Very nice location and nice staff. Hyatt..impressive. Loved the price of room and location. Not a fan of the struggle for parking, thus hotel parking cost a fortune.",nan,1,ex396
expedia,"The room was a little bit dusty, but it had a great view of the lake. The best part about my stay was the comfortable bed. I can't wait to visit this hotel, again!",nan,1,ex397
expedia,"Our room was on the first floor, next to the fire station. It was a bit noisy each time the station got a call. The steak restaurant in the hotel was fantastic!",nan,1,ex398
expedia,The room was clean and very nice from the furnishings to the toilets it's tub was great.,nan,1,ex399
expedia,Great location. Across river from magnificent mile. Very courteous staff,nan,1,ex400
expedia,Loved the location and the view even though we were only on the 7th floor.,nan,1,ex401
expedia,"This hotel was absolutely terrible and I would never stay here again. We ordered room service, it never came. DO NOT eat in the hotel unless you have at least two hours. The service was absolutely terrible and super slow. You have to pay $59 to park per night, which they don't tell you upfront. The hotel staff are all rude. I will never stay at this hotel and I would never recommend this.",nan,1,ex402
expedia,Really nice service,nan,1,ex403
expedia,"We reserved a king size bed, but we're given a queen size bed. The room was TINY. My college dorm room was about the same size- not an exaggeration. This is because we were assigned the room that shared its spase with the stairwell. I assume there is a room like this on every floor. They would be better off using that space as a janitors closet, not assigning it to guests! The furniture in our room was not of highest quality. The sink in the bathroom sprayed water everywhere, and some of the other furniture(like the desk) had scratch marks. Our television was fuzzy and seemed to have trouble maintaining a picture at times. I don't know if this was due to a poor cord connection or if it did not have good reception, or what. Needless to say, we were rather disappointed with our room. The location of this hotel in the city is beautiful and right next to wonderful shopping and excitement. We only stayed one night. When we brought our concerns to the front desk at check out they graciously offered us their buffet breakfast (a $60 value). The breakfast was AWESOME.",nan,1,ex404
expedia,Overall the stay was very good. The outside river/lake view was owesome. We requested the refrigerator and never got it.,nan,1,ex405
expedia,"Stayed here many times. Can't beat the value, view and location.",nan,1,ex406
expedia,It was amazing my fiance and I loved it,nan,1,ex407
expedia,Frequent visitor to this hotel due to its location at the end of Michigan Ave. Within walking distance of all attractions. Its a little big though with the different towers. Renovations make it a bit sterile but all in all its a great location so you don't feel like guests are sitting on top of each other.,nan,1,ex408
expedia,"I parked my vehicle through the Valet and once I discovered the parking for overnight was $59 I left my car and took cabs to where I needed to go. The breakfast ""buffet"" would rival the cost of the finest restaurants on an Easter brunch, but this was just any Monday morning. The breakfast cost me $55 for two.",nan,1,ex409
expedia,"they made ever one were a little plastic bracelet like little kids and if you lost it it wuold cost you $20.00 each one of coarse my kids lost there when we went out for new years and they would not let you to your room till you go and buy a new one even if you left on in your room what load of crap they need to fire the manager how came up with this ,. this wa not know to us till we check in just shove this down us at check in no were else to go on new years. no stars",nan,1,ex410
expedia,I had a very good time at this hotel. All the staff were very nice and helpful. I am very glad that I picked this hotel. I visited the fitness center two times a day and it was fantastic. All the equipment were very clean.,nan,1,ex411
expedia,"The hotel over all is good.. But hotel room at the regency club is disappointing. For the money i paid for the room is not worth. It looks like a standard room in a small town hotel.. Carpet is old, bathroom is small. The front desk is terrible!! For a high end hotel, i would grade it F. The front desk looks very cheap, ceiling is so low. The design is terrible!!! It looks like an airline counter. The front desk of a motel 6 is a lot better. I would go back for food and restaurants. But not to stay as guest. Thank you .",nan,1,ex412
expedia,This is a good place. I would recommend this for anyone who want to visit Chicago. It's in the middle of the town.,nan,1,ex413
expedia,"We had a very nice stay. I read the reviews so I knew not to touch any of the food or drink items so I wouldn't get charged. Our room was very clean and roomy. The staff was very nice and accommodating. Morning brew your own coffee in the room was Starbucks which was nice. It was nice to have a quiet, comfortable, and clean room to come back to after a busy day on the town. Food at the Stetsons restaurant in the hotel was very good but pricy. We had a nice view from our room. I was pleased with our choice to stay here.",nan,1,ex414
expedia,"Great location! We could walk around to do lots of eating, shopping, and site-seeing. The hotel staff were very kind and helpful! They also had a later check out time than we're used to and that was really nice!",nan,1,ex415
expedia,"Cannot believe how nice this hotel was considering the price we paid. The lobby is gorgeous, hotel staff was amazing and our room was huge! First time in Chicago I can definitely say it was the nicest hotel I've ever stayed in! Definitely recommend. Travelled 12/29/13 - 1/1/15",nan,1,ex416

expedia,"Wonderful location,nice environment and great services (include valet parking).",nan,1,ex418
expedia,"Internet service and ballet parking were a bit expensive, but it was a great stay.",nan,1,ex419
expedia,Great location right down town near many attractions. Found parking garage for reasonable price just one block away.,nan,1,ex420
expedia,"We are a family with tall teenagers, therefore, I specifically selected a room with double queen beds when booking the hotel. When we got to our room, after a long trip, we learned that the beds were not queen size but full size beds and the receptionist at the hotel did nothing to change this. We were told that the Hyatt calls their double size beds, queen size. Had we known this, we would have selected another hotel. Also, we were given a handicap room with very little drawer space to place our clothing. The hotel is well located but the internet is extra charge. If you don't mind what size of bed you get in your room, then this hotel should be fine.",nan,1,ex421
expedia,"Fantastic location, friendly staff, great access to city",nan,1,ex422
expedia,"We came to see Newsies but wanted to enjoy Chicago's wonderful atmosphere. The hotel location is wonderful for walking to great shopping, Millenium (spelling?) Park, Navy Pier, and the Oriental Theater. The staff was very helpful, friendly and informed about Chicago. We loved the food options in the hotel. We enjoyed the Marketplace for coffee and breakfast. Our room was clean and comfortable. We would stay here again!",nan,1,ex423
expedia,"We walked from train station, walked to Water Tower Place.Loved your location. Fantastic experience",nan,1,ex424
expedia,"Stayed overnight after attending an event,hotel room was very spacious and clean, service was excellent.",nan,1,ex425
expedia,"My wife daughter and I stayed here to visit the Chicago museums as our Christmas gift to ourselves. This Hotel is considerably more classy than we usually get but it was the right price for our budget. The room was very comfortable. The bed and the pillows were the best ever. You have to be careful about the minibar and the snack tray. They have automatic sensors and if you even move a bad of potato chips you may be charged for it. Also, I wasn't impressed by being charged 9.95 for 24 hours of internet service.",nan,1,ex426
expedia,"Very professional staff, nice facilities and great location.",nan,1,ex427
expedia,Stayed here because we got a $79 holiday rate and our son didn't have enough room in his apartment.,nan,1,ex428
expedia,"Our room had two connecting rooms. One room had our other family members, but the other connecting room was not. They were very loud and the noise was annoying when they returned to their room at 5:00am.",nan,1,ex429
expedia,Nice hotel. Like a black nasty dirt in the glasses but not a big deal. They fixed it. Great place.,nan,1,ex430
expedia,"The hotel was not cleaned very well, it was very small. It did have a great view, and friendly staff. Not a hotel meant for a family to stay at, more for buisness people.",nan,1,ex431
expedia,we had an excellent stay. All of the staff was more than eager to help us with any of our questions. Highly recommend this hotel,nan,1,ex432
expedia,"Trip was fine. Hotel in pretty good condition, good service. Only complaint is please get rid of those chairs in guest rooms. They look great but are the most uncomfortable chairs I have ever seen. The chairs in the common area on the second floor better.",nan,1,ex433
expedia,"great location, good service and facility, room is a little bit dark, room service is slow...",nan,1,ex434
expedia,This hotel is one of my favorite places to stay in Chitown. Best location to walk anywhere and comfortable.,nan,1,ex435
expedia,"Every time I stay at the Hyatt the whole evening is excellent. Despite the fact that this hotel is huge, they get you right through on check-in. There was a small problem with the elevator and even though we were on the 30th floor as soon as we clicked on the down button, they had someone there to take us down the service elevator with a slight delay. Great customer service and the price is great for the location.",nan,1,ex436
expedia,Beautiful hotel. And friendly staff,nan,1,ex437
expedia,"Stay was great. However, I cannot understand why valet parking is must. It is $59! It would be 30 at most.",nan,1,ex438
expedia,"Checked in . Lobby looks like an aorport terminal, not inviting at all .. Then got to our room great view !! But after 4 hrs in the room we killed 6 big black spiders ! Um groose , they moved us to another room and gave usca 50 credit ! But my card still has charges pending where they charged me for 2 rooms . So fighting that still .",nan,1,ex439
expedia,We enjoyed ourselves. The hotel is very pretty and conveniently located to downtown shopping,nan,1,ex440
expedia,"Staff at check in were very friendly, room did not have the best view and the maid service was average at best. There was a print out about guest services on the desk which was wrinkled and used by the prior visitors in our room while they did not replace our towels and I had to find someone in the hall way to request more towels. Towels we did use were spread out over the hooks in a messy fashion after they had cleaned the room.",nan,1,ex441
expedia,"The hole experience was good, location is great and staff very friendly",nan,1,ex442
expedia,Every time I walked into the lobby I could smell the delicate bouquet of the fresh flowers. There was an orchids on the table in the restaurant.,nan,1,ex443
expedia,"Nice four star hotel near magnificent mile and Hancock tower. I had an upgrade to an executive room at 30th floor, very classy and pretty large.",nan,1,ex444
expedia,"Rooms smaller than I thought. Luxurious bathroom, nice location. Beds very comfortable. Would be nice if one could check in before 3pm without a large fee. Parking is very expensive, but no different than anywhere in Chicago. Close to everything. Lovely French lady helped us check in. May return, but will probably try another hotel with larger room.",nan,1,ex445
expedia,consistently wonderful service. great location relaxing contemporary environment - good vibe - not stuff old money kind of place -,nan,1,ex446
expedia,We enjoyed the hotel very much and the location. Everything was in walking distance.,nan,1,ex447
expedia,staff was very friendly and helpful. The rooms were updated and clean. The hotel was in the middle of everything ! I would definitely come back,nan,1,ex448
expedia,"The hotel was very nice and modern but the service was poor. Sat in the bar for 10 mins before someone took our order. After another 15 mins a new server came by to check on us. They retook the order and it took another 10 mins. Tons of staff running around - very inefficient. Went to breakfast in the morning and service was awful. Clearly understaffed. People were complaining all around about the poor service. I felt bad for our server - he was clearly overwhelmed. We were supposed to be served fresh pasteries during our breakfast. We asked 4 times they never came until the bill. If you are going to offer something, you should be able to deliver. Great hotel but they need to get service in order before it tanks their business.",nan,1,ex449
expedia,"Super friendly staff. Clead, contemporary look. Big Fan",nan,1,ex450
expedia,"Lovely hotel in a good location. Friendly staff and comfortable, well appointed rooms.",nan,1,ex451
expedia,"The staff is outstanding, professional and friendly. They made our visit very pleasant and efficient. Excellent location proximately to restaurants and shopping. Safe to walk outside at night",nan,1,ex452
expedia,"My only less than stellar feedback was the floor under the bed was filthy. Obviously the person responsible to the room cleanliness was less than efficient. Also, no refill of my ""K-cups"" in my room which meant that I ad to go to the lobby for coffee and bring back to my room. That was unfortunate as those whit whom I interacted were wonderful.",nan,1,ex453
expedia,We reserved a room on the 31st floor. The view was awesome. The hotel is located close to the John Hancock tower and is walking distance from the Magnificent Mile and public transportation. The staff was extremely helpful and anticipated our needs. Additionally the bar is excellent. Cocktails were made with care and the food was excellent. Definitely recommend.,nan,1,ex454
expedia,"The hotel has a great location, lovely staff and beautiful rooms. What more can you ask for?",nan,1,ex455
expedia,"Lovely property - very comfortable and nicely appointed room with a good view, desk, and very comfortable bed and linens. When I couldn't get room service (no answer after multiple calls) I went to the front desk and they were really accommodating and had it ordered and sent up promptly. Small fitness room would be the only drawback here.",nan,1,ex456
expedia,Overall I was impressed with the friendly efficient service and the top notch quality of the room and restaurant/bar. Excellent location too. Good job Sofitel!,nan,1,ex457
expedia,"Friendliest hotel staff I've had. Attentive, concerned, and want to make your visit the best.",nan,1,ex458
expedia,"Quiet, well run hotel with European flair. Room carefully planned and very comfy. Bathroom is devine with French amenities. Everything works properly. Only minor flaw was inconsistent housekeeping, some days perfect, others missed a soap or failed to replace shampoo. Overall a lovely hotel, very pleasant stay and would repeat visit without question.",nan,1,ex459
expedia,"I was recently in Chicago for a Seminar and needed to book a room for the first night of my travels as the other hotel where I was later staying could not accommodate a Wednesday night stay. I found the staff to be particularly helpful. I forgot my Ipad Mini Lightening Charge Cord in the room and when I stopped back on the following day, Volkan, who was at the front desk personally went to the room and retrieved if for me. The availability of coffee, fruit and free work out facilities made the hotel a value where the other hotel where I later stayed charged for everything. The hotel is hip and has updated amenities and is centrally located to great restaurants and shopping. I will definitely be returning to stay here in the future.",nan,1,ex460
expedia,"Didn't spend much time in the hotel, but it was very comfortable and quiet. Front desk staff very courteous. Concierge services were very good. The bed was very comfortable.",nan,1,ex461
expedia,The Sofitel is in a perfect location . We were upgraded to a Junior suite which was very nice. The staff was very helpful and friendly. I would definitely stay again.,nan,1,ex462
expedia,"We had a great time at the Sofitel. The location was perfect for sightseeing, shopping and exploring the numerous restaurants in downtown Chicago. It's 2 blocks from a CTA station so it's very accessible. The staff were all very friendly, courteous and helpful! When our flight got cancelled and we had to recheck back into the hotel for an extra night, we got upgraded as a ""thank you"" for coming back. It made our day after all the trouble we had to deal with the cancelled flight! They also offer free wifi, which may be a small thing but a lot of high end hotels ask you to pay for this as an extra. I would come back and stay here again, because even with a little bit higher room rate, you're getting your money's worth in terms of comfort and service.",nan,1,ex463
expedia,Great hotel. Beautiful lobby and fabulous location. You can walk everywhere!,nan,1,ex464

expedia,"So enjoyed this sleek, clean, modern hotel within walking distance of Michigan Ave and other attractions. Hotel staff is excellent, attending to every need quickly. Would stay here again in a heartbeat. Free good coffee in the AM. Cozy fireplace near bar. Didn't use the restaurant but it was bright and seemed popular. The rooms weren't the biggest but had lovely spa-like bathrooms and comfortable beds. Amazing views from our 25th floor room. Elevators were efficient and quick. All in all one of the best stays we've had in Chicago, and we've stayed in many hotels there visiting family. Will definitely come again!",nan,1,ex470
expedia,"This hotel is very modern. The beds were fantastic, possibly the best I've ever slept on in a hotel. Overall a great location too. Close to shopping, area attractions, and the ""L"" train.",nan,1,ex471
expedia,"Probably one of the worst ""luxury"" hotels I've stayed at. We had double bed room but beds were small and uncomfortable. Fancy Kureg coffeemaker didn't work and staff were slow to bring up another one. We had already got dressed to go down to lobby to bring up some coffee. No charging stations for phone. It's 2015... Everyone needs to charge their phones. I had to hunt for a wall plug behind bed. Bath robe in bathroom was hard and scratchy.",nan,1,ex472

expedia,"Spent 1 week on business. When staying for business, I want the hotel to be as smooth as possible. And the Sofitel succeeded in this on almost every level. The only disappointing thing is the wifi costs. To get usable wifi I had to pay $14.99 per day. I feel a hotel like the Sofitel should not be nickle and diming their customers.",nan,1,ex478
expedia,Business trip... Great King-size bed. The down comforter and mattress cover are a plus! I chose this hotel just for the tub in the bathroom. Even men enjoy a soothing bath some time.,nan,1,ex479

They gladly went to the car to go get our items. Room was perfect, just would have loved a refrigerator to store food after our outings. The location was prefect to walk to Michigan ave, and shop!!!! The people in the city were very nice. I can't wait to come back to Chicago, we will be staying here again!!!!",nan,1,ex512

expedia,"Short stay in Chicago. Hotel was convenient, clean and staff very welcoming.",nan,1,ex525
expedia,"Stayed three nights at the Sofitel for a weekend getaway. The hotel was extremely well priced for the beautiful accommodations (probably because it was January), but I plan to visit Chicago more often and stay at this same hotel.

expedia,Awesome hotel. Stayed for 2 nights and not a single complaint. The location is awesome with plenty of restaurants close by - try Luxbar just three blocks away and excellent. Hancock Observatory was directly outside our window which was an amazing view it is also well worth the visit to the Observatory Deck. The concierge service never disappointed although our visit was short we packed a lot in and loved staying at this hotel. The wait staff at the bar were fabulous and the little snacks they provide are amazing -especially the popcorn! Great view of the Hancock Building stay in room 1710.,nan,1,ex536

expedia,"My wife, two (older) children and I took a quick trip to Chicago for the weekend. We booked this hotel mainly for it's convenient location and comparatively affordable rates. In fact, it was so affordable that while we initially booked a room with two doubles, my wife and I booked another room for ourselves when we got there. We were thoroughly impressed with the Sofitel quality. The architectural design and great personal service are unique experience for families that value such attributes. Pictures of Picasso and other artists line the walls and blend in with the rest demonstrating a commitment to aesthetic values beyond the provincial effort of other places. Our trip to the Art Institute over the weekend seemed to fit perfectly. The food was equally great although here I must admit, a bit pricey. There is a BOSE radio in every room (at least the two we were in) and that meant a lot to me. Along with the things mentioned above, this small attention to detail overwhelmingly makes Sofitel experience ""worth"" more than many other hotels in the area that boast luxury at its corresponding price. Highly subjective review, I know. But we were sufficiently and pleasantly surprised enough to share a positive experience.",nan,1,ex541
expedia,"wonderful, we will come back! The hotel attended to personal preferences!",nan,1,ex542
expedia,Went on a couples trip and had an amazing time. We got there and upgraded to a suite and it was perfect size for having our friends stop over and lounge around before dinner out.

expedia,We had a wonderful stay celebrating our 2nd Anniversary. We felt that we received exceptional hospitality by the hotel staff all around. We would recommend Sofitel Chicago to everybody!,nan,1,ex549
expedia,Nice hotel. Very central. Excellent condition. The only reason I'm not giving full marks is that there was a kind of smell in my room.,nan,1,ex550
expedia,"Wonderful ""girls"" overnight! My best friend and I celebrated her birthday and enjoyed our stay at this fine hotel. We were immediately upgraded upon arrival to the 30th floor- awesome view! A delicious little chocolate dessert was sent to our room, compliments of the hotel, in honor of my friend's birthday.

Great Stay.",nan,1,ex552
expedia,"This was my second time in this hotel. I was disappointed by a couple of misunderstandings with the staff, first when I was checking in, and then when I was leaving for the airport. Also, while I remember being impressed by the presentation of food ordered from the room service menu in the past, during this visit, the presentation was poor. This is still a nice hotel, but it didn't meet the expectations that had been set a couple of years back.",nan,1,ex553
expedia,Excellent choice for a last minute getaway. Hotel is conveniently located within walking distance or a short cab ride of most major attractions and an abundance of great dining!,nan,1,ex554

expedia,I had a one night stay the rom was very comfortable. The concierge was very helpful. Great location.,nan,1,ex557
expedia,We were looking to get away for a night. I decided to upgrade to a high floor king. I just had different expectations based on an upgraded king room and my experience and other high-end hotels. Everything was fine the bathroom was the best attribute of what was otherwise a fairly plain room.,nan,1,ex558

expedia,"This hotel was modern, clean, and close to the Magnificent Mile and lots of other shops and restaurants, which was absolutely perfect for our trip. My husband and I had a great experience here for a short 3-day getaway. They upgraded us to a higher floor upon check-in (without charge) and all the staff were very friendly. We had a good time at Le Bar on evening, which has a great food and cocktail menu. Our room was modern, the king bed was super comfy, and we absolutely loved the amenities in the bathroom, which included Lanvin toiletries and a separate tub and shower. The hotel is also close to the Red Line (stop at State and Chicago), which was also really nice for getting around to some other neighborhood shopping and eating (i.e., Lincoln Park, Lakeview, etc.). Overall, location, services, amenities, and comfort were amazing and we would definitely come back!",nan,1,ex563
expedia,We had a wonderful time. The hotel was very beautiful! The staff was very kind and helpful. It was located near many tourist attractions that were in walking distance. We would definitely stay there again.,nan,1,ex564
expedia,"Overall hotel was modern and neighborhood great. My only complaint is that the food/drinks within the hotel were very overpriced. I understand that it is a luxury hotel, but I wasn't impressed by the quality of the food foe the price. The bar has a hip atmosphere. Skip room service or breakfast at the hotel and go to the cafe next door. You will get more food for the $$.",nan,1,ex565
expedia,WE had a wonderful stay at this hotel. When we arrived we were given a room and when we got to the room the room was not serviced. WE talked to the registration staff immediately and they gave us a clean room. Later that day the management apologized for their mistake by sending us chocolate covered strawberries and water. It was a very nice and classy gesture.,nan,1,ex566
expedia,Love hotel. Great lobby great location to all shops & restaurants. Michigan ave is walking distance away.,nan,1,ex567
expedia,"Let me start by saying the Sofitel is one of the most beautiful hotels in the city. The exterior deserves to be on the Chicago skyline and the lobby is one of the nicest in the city. Service was quick, clean, percise and courteous. I love the french accents by the way. The only knock is I felt kind of let down by the appearance of my guestroom. Now it was very nice and clean but I almost felt like I walked into different hotel, again it was very nice, but I expected to be impressed as I was with the rest of the hotel.",nan,1,ex568

expedia,I enjoyed this hotel very much. The rooms are reasonable for the quality and comfort. They are new and have plenty of amenities. One of the best features is that the hotel doesn't gouge for basic services like internet and television. Basic internet is free for the guests and there are options to pay for higher speeds. The gym has 12 cardio machines along with dumbbells and a machine which is nice for travelers. Each cardio machine has a television and is top quality.,nan,1,ex578

expedia,A great hotel.,nan,1,ex584
expedia,"Didn't get to experience much of the hotel since we were out most of the time. I was disappointed that there's no mini fridge in the room for leftovers. Stayed in a king superior room and no mini fridge, what's up with that!? I think the only extra for getting the king superior was the nicer bathroom, which was quite nice. Would definitely stay there agin. Staff were quite nice.",nan,1,ex585

expedia,"My wife and I were celebrating our 25th wedding anniversary in Chicago and had not stayed at a Sofitel hotel. We were thoroughly impressed by the hotel staff and food during our stay. In my years traveling for business and pleasure no hotel compared to the personal touch, professionalism and sincere interest in ensuring that our stay was a distinctly positive, enjoyable and memorable experience. The Sofitel more than accomplished this. We will be making a point to stay at a Sofitel over other premier hotels whenever possible during our future travels.",nan,1,ex591

expedia,"Last Thanksgiving we ate at Cafe des Architects. This year we ended up returning at Thanksgiving so decided to eat there again and then extend our stay to the hotel. We are very glad we did. We had a long drive in to Chicago so arrived late afternoon on Thanksgiving. The valet man gave us a great tip to self park since we were not taking our car in and out. That saved us about $20. The front desk and bell hop people were very friendly. We booked for a cheaper, lower room and were upgraded to a lovely upper room. The room was spacious and well appointed. There is a luxurious 4 piece bath with great extras like loofahs and creams. There was a Keurig coffee maker and we had free wireless that was pretty good. The bed was large and extremely comfortable. It was quiet and beyond comfortable. When we booked I paid $10 more for continental breakfast. Well, Cafes des Architectes does not really have a continental breakfast.....they have a full, fabulous breakfast. Offerings are from bacon and eggs to omelettes to oatmeal. Juice and coffe/tea are included. I would say it was worth $30-40 so the upgrade was well worth it. This hotel is on Rush Street so it close to the Magnificent Mile. Both the restaurant and bar are worth a stop. The breakfast was unexpected, the Thanksgiving dinner was great, the wait staff is professional and friendly. The bar prepares a great Manhattan. Come enjoy this hotel.",nan,1,ex605

expedia,"Sofitel is a striking building and that inspiring look carries on inside as well. Beautiful design creates an elegant atmosphere. Our room was perfectly sized with a king bed, desk and comfy chair. Functional design hid the minibar and room safe and allowed plenty of storage. Kurig coffe maker was a nice touch along with the customary iron and hair drier. The bathroom had separate tub and shower and plenty of soft hot water, and a loofa! Some people may consider the room small, no separate sitting area, but we didn't go to the city and pay for an upscale hotel to sit in the room. It is comfortable and well appointed. Great design gives good energy. The staff were all friendly, helpful and knowledgeable of the hotel and the local area. We did not eat at the restaurant but did enjoy the bar.

expedia,"Great location, and staff, the hotel overall it's great, will stay here again !",nan,1,ex625
expedia,"It was really quite nice. Great location, just *slightly* off Michigan Avenue. Fancy but still very comfortable. Had a room on the 31st floor with great views of the city with some view of the lake.",nan,1,ex626
expedia,Had a horrible time at the airport..staff made me feel like I was at home with my family..excellent service.,nan,1,ex627
expedia,"Staff always up to help people, our room always ready, very nice bar, one of the best on Chicago, recommended 100%",nan,1,ex628
expedia,"It was good, I won't stay there again because the hotel charged me $125 for incidentals. It will be reimbursed, but annoying now I have to follow up and make sure it's refunded. I have have experienced that in my travels.",nan,1,ex629
expedia,"Very nice hotel, great customer service and excellent location to Michigan Ave. We had the breakfast and it was fabulous",nan,1,ex630
expedia,"My daughter and I just stayed one night at the hotel but will return next time we need a hotel off of Michigan Ave. Great location. We had dinner and breakfast at the hotel restaurant - Cafe des architectes - French Restaurant. The meal was outstanding, the service was outstanding and we would eat there again. When we arrived to our room there was a dessert and two bottles of water waiting for us with a card wishing me a happy birthday. In the evening there is a turn down service and we found chocolate chip cookies in the room by the bed. These small touches really made the stay memorable. In the morning in the cafe there is free coffee and tea but I recommend having breakfast there. My daughter had the nutella pancakes and I had crepes. They walk around with fresh breads and crossiants that are made daily. We take a trip once a year to Chicago and we will book this hotel again.",nan,1,ex631
expedia,Always a comfortable and pleasant stay. Hotel conditions still look good. Rooms are nice size and very quiet when compared to a stay at another nearby hotel.,nan,1,ex632
expedia,"Everything as expected for the price. Great service, great room, great location.",nan,1,ex633
expedia,"This is a very nicely appointed, quiet and comfortable hotel. The staff is eager to please and very professional. This is the second time ( in 5 years) that we have stayed here and it has been the same story both times. If you valet the car, they give you a number to text when you want your car brought up and they text you when it is ready. That is smart. The room is very comfortable, we had a Junior Suite on our first visit and got a Luxury Room this visit and I didn't miss the extra space of the Suite. The bed is superb.",nan,1,ex634
expedia,Have stayed here many times. Excellent hotel in every way in a great location.,nan,1,ex635
expedia,"One of our top hotel choices in Chicago.. The lobby area, restaurant, rooms and staff are excellent.. Great location - walking distance to all shops and restaurants.. Love Sofitel :)",nan,1,ex636
expedia,"The hotel is great - modern and clean, and focused on customer service. The location is wonderful. Near Michigan Avenue, but not on it so it's away from the madness. Also just a few blocks from the subway, super convenient. We would definitely stay here again.",nan,1,ex637
expedia,Great hotel in a fun area,nan,1,ex638
expedia,Great hotel with an amazing location. The only reason we didn't give it the highest rating was because the telecom closet was right next door and there was a constant tapping/ratcheting noise in the bathroom that we could hear throughout our stay.,nan,1,ex639
expedia,My friend and I enjoyed our stay at the Sofitel near the Water Tower. The location is great for walking to various sites. The staff were all friendly and helpful. The room was clean and well-appointed.,nan,1,ex640
expedia,"Beautiful hotel, friendly staff! Room was clean and comfortable. Bathroom immaculate. Love the fragrance in the lobby!",nan,1,ex641
expedia,Perfect location for business and pleasure. Easy access to everything a visitor may need in Chicago.Staff are very nice and could not be more helpful,nan,1,ex642
expedia,After a less than stellar appearance I decided to stay here again with my family. Check in was fine till they could't figure out where they stored my luggage and I walked with the bellman through all the storage areas to find it. Room was great. The guys at the front door were obnoxious and always seemed very involved with themselves. I wanted to use the Equinox around the corner (the fitness center is quite small at the hotel but certainly usable) and having worked there years ago I knew the policy for age was 16 and over. The concierge was pretty sure it wasn't. I made him call the place to confirm I was correct. Rather than just say sorry and enjoy your workout he blamed the place for false info. Dining service was chaotic and the food trickled to my table. First some pancakes for my daughter which she loved. 2 minutes later some eggs for me. 4 minutes later my toast arrived. There was just 2 of us. Sure this is all sort of minor stuff. If this were a discount motel I'd be pretty impressed but at between 400-500 per night these little details become glaring. I really wanted this to work but I think my colleagues and I are done with you for now.,nan,1,ex643
expedia,"Meridith, the bar tender was our first encounter with service excellence and it never dropped from there. Everything was an A+ (except the decor seems a bit dated and the finishes are a little worn). But I would stay there again. The rooms are large and VERY comfortable. They even have a bathtub, which is wonderful. Although a little short.",nan,1,ex644
expedia,"I stayed at this hotel when I was running the marathon. The hotel is in a great location; easy to get to North Michigan ave and from there to all major neighbourhoods. The staff were always extremely friendly, personable and attentive without being overbearing. The room was big, clean and well furnished with great facilities. The views were great too! A big plus was the restaurant.... The food for both breakfast and dinner was always excellent and although a touch on the high side, I felt overall was pretty reasonably priced. I will absolutely recommend this hotel and would like to express thanks to al staff who made my stay so relaxed, comfortable and pleasant.",nan,1,ex645
expedia,We had a great experience staying at Sofitel Water Tower North. It was expensive due to the Chicago marathon that weekend but we ended up very happy we stayed here due to its convenience to all downtown had to offer. The amenities were very nice. It was clean and comfortable. The staff was superb.,nan,1,ex646
expedia,All excellent except the ladies at the restaurant desk had us wait for a table when there were plenty available with the explanation they were not cleared as get. The organization of the dining room at the top is less than perfect. The waitress was very nice.,nan,1,ex647
expedia,The staff was great and the hotel was a treat. The neighborhood setting and easy access to shopping and restaurants made for a fun and unique experience. We will definitely stay here again.,nan,1,ex648
expedia,"Service, Lage, Einrichtung und speziell das hilfsbereite und freundliche Personal - einfach alles sehr,sehr gut.",nan,1,ex649
expedia,Great Hotel. The room was great but was very dry. Never drank so much water in my live. The concierge gave us some misinformation on the road closures. Thought that was their job. Over all loved the hotel.,nan,1,ex650
expedia,"The hotel is absolutely amazing. It is very modern, and the staff is incredibly professional and accommodating. I cannot recall being waited on that well since vacations to all-inclusives in Mexico. It is one of the best hotels I have ever stayed in. My only complaint was that it was difficult to get cold, yes cold, water in the morning at the sink. For some odd reason the water was often unbearably hot at the sink. Other than that I would definitely stay at the Sofitel again. It's pricey, but well worth it given the amenities and quality of service.",nan,1,ex651
expedia,"Staff went out of their way to make sure our stay was a pleasant experience. My future daughter in law had a suite the night before her wedding, I also stayed due to convenience with my 5 year old grand-daughter who was the flower girl. The morning of the wedding we headed towards the lobby for breakfast, asked if they had any crayons to keep my 5 year old entertained, but they did not. They went out of their way to sent some-one to the store to get crayons and immediately brought them to our suite. Thank you so much",nan,1,ex652
expedia,Service was poor. Room was clean but mattress extremely soft and in need of replacement. Had to call for repairs to cable TV. Unimpressed compared to other Chicago hotels I've stayed.,nan,1,ex653
expedia,Pleasant experience even though the staff appeared short. The reception guy mark wanted me to stay there longer because of his kindness.,nan,1,ex654
expedia,Best lux hotel in Chicago. Period.,nan,1,ex655
expedia,Courteous staff clean and modern with excellent locstion,nan,1,ex656
expedia,"Love the Chicago Sofitel! While the hotel is large, the friendly and accommodating staff always do a fantastic job of making me feel like I'm an important guest and not just a room number. I like to take my business to companies that place an emphasis on Customer service, and for me, Sofitel is on that list. The hotel itself is very desirably located just a few blocks away from Michigan Ave, Lake Shore Drive, Hancock Tower, the river, etc - all places that an out-of-towner might like to visit. The rooms are lovely with floor to ceiling windows and very large bathrooms. I'm sensitive to my surroundings, and I love that the rooms are decorated such that they feel modern, yet comfortable and inviting. I also love the view. Since Sofitel is situated amongst other buildings, you won't have an unobstructed view of the lake, but rooms on higher floors facing east will see parts of the lake in between some of the fabulous Chicago architecture :-) Overall, 2 enthusiastic thumbs up! Can't wait to go back.",nan,1,ex657
expedia,We spent four nights here early October and enjoyed our stay. The bedroom was spacious and very comfortable. The hotel bar was good. Breakfast was OK. Staff very pleasant and helpful. Had a great stay in Chicago and would definitely stay here again.,nan,1,ex658
expedia,"We have visited Chicago many times, and this is by far our favorite place to stay. The location couldn't really be any better if you are looking for shopping, dining, and entertainment along the Gold Coast, or the north end of the Magnificent Mile. Being just a block and a half off Michigan meant we were close to everything, yet the heavy traffic was not on our doorstep. Loved the little park across the street. The complimentary breakfast was actually a breakfast! Well done all around. We have found our new go-to place for staying in Chicago.",nan,1,ex659
expedia,Grat business stay.,nan,1,ex660
expedia,"Sofitel water tower Chicago was fantastic, the service was very professional and made you feel very important. The room was clean and the bed very comfortable. Would highly recommend this hotel to a friend.",nan,1,ex661
expedia,Very well designed and comfortable hotel at a good location next to the Lamborghini dealer :-),nan,1,ex662
expedia,"Wish I would have found this hotel sooner! I have been traveling to Chicago for business every month for the past two years. I always make it a point to try a different hotel each time in order to get the full flavor if such a great city. Had I found the Sofitel sooner, it would have been my go-to. This is a terrific property, very comfortable, clean, good restaurants, and located in the perfect neighborhood. Easy walking distance to Gibsons and Del Frisco's, and a ton of great shopping. You won't be disappointed here!",nan,1,ex663
expedia,"Excellent hotel in a very convenient location, great staff and fantastic bed.",nan,1,ex664
expedia,"Sofitel's beds are absolutely the most comfortable I've ever slept on. While I'm not a fan of the Hermes bath products provided in each bathroom, I did hear from the Manager who kindly offered soaps/shampoos/lotions in a different scent upon request. I will continue to be a patron of this hotel.",nan,1,ex665
expedia,The hotel was very nice. the room was clean but not as impressive as we were led to believe. The desk was all scratched up and the carpet a bit worn.,nan,1,ex666
expedia,Great hotel stay and concierge advice. Close to many attractions. We would come back.,nan,1,ex667
expedia,"Our wedding weekend was a total success with the help of Sofitel Chicago. We had three rooms, a King Suite, a JR Suite and one King Bed. The two suites were used for bride and groom prepping. They were great rooms to entertain friends and family prior to the ceremony. The Sofitel Chicago is a wonderful place in a perfect location. We have stayed here several times and enjoy it more and more every time.",nan,1,ex668
expedia,"Never stayed at a Sofitel hotel before and had a wonderful experience. The rooms were very clean and a good size. The beds had extra padding for comfort, which was very nice. The Bathroom was nice and big. The staff was very nice and friendly. Enjoyed my stay. Thank you.",nan,1,ex669
expedia,"The whole experience was wonderful. Staff were very friendly, helpful and accommodating in so many ways.",nan,1,ex670
expedia,"Our room was small but very nicely decorated. Minimalist and clean. Bathroom was lovely, shower was dreamy. Really nice Lanvin products in bathroom. The service was not Four Seasons quality, but it was very very good regardless. Had drinks and snacks in the bar and they were great.",nan,1,ex671
expedia,"This hotel is modern, spacious, luxurious and situated very close to both the key shopping areas and dining areas of the northern part of the city. We were on the 17th floor and so didn't have much of a view but the upper floors would be able to see over the lake. Separate shower and bath was a real bonus and the king size bed was both large and comfortable. Had all the usual amenities for a good quality hotel and the work of the cleaning staff couldn't be faulted. Peter the concierge was extremely helpful with a couple of our requests and the check out/in was seamless. The walk to Michigan ave was only a couple of minutes as was the walk to the restaurant strip. Being in the more ritzy area of Chicago the cost of meals in the various restaurants was towards the upper end but we couldn't fault the food or service at any restaurant we visited. Overall the Sofitel was excellent and our stay was most enjoyable.",nan,1,ex672
expedia,Enjoyed the hotel. It was conveniently located and very comfortable. Would highly recommend.,nan,1,ex673
expedia,Due to some mistakes on our part we had some problems at check in. Michael (at the front desk) went out of his way to make things right. It was greatly appreciated.,nan,1,ex674
expedia,Michael at guest relations was awesome Great location Great staff Makes a great hotel,nan,1,ex675
expedia,"Food was way too overpriced. I was also surprised on the size of the rooms,a bit small. Overall a good experience.",nan,1,ex676
expedia,"la atencion del personal fue muy buena,los precios del restaurante caros",nan,1,ex677
expedia,Very enjoyable. Excellent service by all staff. Good gym.,nan,1,ex678
expedia,"Excellent service but very average room and value for the price. I am a Chicago native and I have stayed in other, comparable hotels with nicer rooms for less money. Location is good but other hotels are in the vicinity. In addition, I have stayed at other Sofitel locations that had much nicer rooms.",nan,1,ex679
expedia,The hotel staff are cold and lack the sense of customer service. This is a reflection of the hotel attitude toward his guests. I am an expedia gold member legible for upgrade. Despite my 6 nights stay the hotel management showed zero interest to accommodate my request. The phrase they used ( subject to availability ). There are many other much nicer and courteous hotels in chicago magnificent mile area and I I do suggest to look for other hotels before some one consider this hotel,nan,1,ex680
expedia,"Staying af Sofitel Water Tower was a pleasure. Room was fine, staff was friendly and the location is fine for a quick tour down town Chicago after working hours.",nan,1,ex681
expedia,"My husband and I stayed one night in the Sofitel. The hotel is easy to find and in a great neighborhood. There is say access to the Red Line and constant cabs so you can go anywhere. It is a big, modern hotel and very European. If you want to save $20 plus valet tip, consider parking at the garage next door. It's very easy and about a minute walk. The rooms are bright and comfortable. We had a gorgeous view of the Hancock from our 23rd floor room. Love the beautiful marble bathroom with the Lanvin products. It was a nice stay and I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone--although it's not cheap!",nan,1,ex682
expedia,Loved it! Easy to walk to everything! Very clean and upscale hotel!,nan,1,ex683
expedia,Excelent location close to all restaurant and shpping stores. The king suite was comfy and classy.,nan,1,ex684
expedia,"Very nice hotel. Great rooms and service located in the middle of magnificent mile in Chicago steps away from deep dish pizza restaurant, shops. a Bit noisy with all the sirens but all hotels in downtown Chicago suffer from street noise.",nan,1,ex685
expedia,"Good experience, nice staff. Only complaint is that they don't give you a receipt when you leave.",nan,1,ex686
expedia,"Loved the corner room, bed comfort, coffee bar on 4th floor. Wifi should be free for all, not just club members. 67 dollars is too much for valet. With tips it came to over $70 per day. Otherwise, great.",nan,1,ex687
expedia,"The bed needs To be replace!!!! So worn out, you end up in the middle of the bed (in a hole!!!)",nan,1,ex688
expedia,great trip to Chicago. had lots of fun. Great location,nan,1,ex689
expedia,"The hotel was in a great spot, with plenty of dining options close by. The room was nice but a bit awkwardly set up with the tv against the long wall, between the bed and sofa. It didn't point towards either one and was too wide to twist completely. There should be free wifi for all. I object to paying for wifi in an expensive hotel.",nan,1,ex690
expedia,"Awesome hotel right in the middle of Michigan Ave. The guys out front were the nicest, giving you direction and telling you the best places to eat! Would stay again",nan,1,ex691
expedia,"The turndown service staff are quite invasive. The night I checked in, someone knocked at around 6pm and asked if I ordered turndown service which I did not since I just arrived. Each morning between 9am to 11am in 30min intervals someone would knock and/or use a room key to come cleam the room - quite annoying if you are trying to sleep in on the weekend. On one of the nights, I left my room for an hour only to find the turndown service came in and replaced the soaps and give one new towel. It seems that they must have come in and realized that I was out for a few minutes and left. The odd thing was that they filled my ice bucket?? Maybe they were planning to take a break or thought that I went out for ice?? I have a few theories; they like to be very clean (doubtful), they have bad processes and re-clean rooms for no apparent reason only to keep their jobs (plausible), some suspect activities going on like going through people's luggage (plausible). Room was nice an renovated but turndown service is very invasive.",nan,1,ex692
expedia,"Lovely hotel, excellent restaurant with all locally sourced food, windows that open, free wifi in lobby and restaurant, great suite style rooms, nice gym + pool, centrally located.",nan,1,ex693
expedia,Overall a good experience. Room was a little cold but otherwise fine. Good location for shopping.,nan,1,ex694
expedia,The service was amazing! Everyone was so friendly!! The bellhop was especially nice! Early check-In and rooms were wonderful!!! Would go back for sure!!!,nan,1,ex695
expedia,"The hotel was nice, very conveniently located. Beautiful view. Would totally stay again. But find alternative parking, valet is all they offer and its far more expensive than other valet parking in the area.",nan,1,ex696
expedia,"The Omni is in a perfect location for all of the sites, sounds and experiences of downtown and the Mag Mile. Perfect for families who need some space.",nan,1,ex697
expedia,"We were disappointed that our room was not ready when promised. We had to wait nearly an hour for our room to be ready. We had just driven seven hours with kids and we wanted to relax but could not do so. Also, the refrigerator was so small that it could not hold any food at all. The mini bar was over the top. We could have spend hundreds of dollars on ordinary crappy snacks that we could get from Walgreen's down the street. We had to take all of the high-priced items out of reach so as not to confuse the kids and allow them to eat a $5.00 Snicker's Bar or drink a $7.00 bottle of water!!! The positives were that the beds were comfortable and the location of the hotel is in close proximity to so much in downtown Chigago.",nan,1,ex698
expedia,"Hotel was very nice, but unless you dont want to spend a ton of money this place isn't for you. you have to pay $10 a night for wifi, they don't even let you have it for free after you've spend $150 on the room per night already. Plus parking is a little obnoxious $67 per day is a lot. They come to your room quite a bit and it's a little unsettling knowing they're coming to your room more than once.",nan,1,ex699
expedia,"My daughter and I had a wonderful ""Girls Getaway"". Staying at the Omni was outstanding and a quick walk to the American Girl store, which was the reason for our trip. The room was beautiful and very comfortable. The staff was wonderful and my daughter delivery special with The treat bag she was greeted with when we checked in.",nan,1,ex700
expedia,"The Omni Staff were always helpful, gave us great recommendations for places to eat and treated our son like a king.",nan,1,ex701

expedia,"From the moment we stepped out of the cab, the Omni hotel staff was wonderful. We checked our bags early and pre-checked into our room. Once checked in our room was clean and lovely. The bed was heavenly. Noon check out was unexpected and awesome. Everything was terrific. I will be back!",nan,1,ex705
expedia,"From the minute, we entered the hotel the staff was a pleasure. The Front Desk woman that I worked with was exceptional and extremely helpful. I was satisfied with our room and the price we paid for it.",nan,1,ex706
expedia,"Perfect location, nice hotel, nice staff, nice lounge to eat/drink, clean comfortable room",nan,1,ex707
expedia,The Omni was ideal for the reasons we stayed on the mag mile in Chicago. It was close in proximity to the events being attended and it was a reasonable price. The family enjoyed coming and going as the hotel was our central meeting place.,nan,1,ex708
expedia,"Nice upscale hotel, freindly staff and an awesome restaurant! Lots of places to eat in Chicago but be sure to try the hotel restaurant. The Walleye sandwich was absolutely fantastic!",nan,1,ex709
expedia,Great location and near great shopping and Gino's East! The hotel staff was great and always very friendly. The pool was a bit on the small side and quickly filled up with kids. The maximum number of people allowed in the hot tub was 3 and there were usually way more than that in it. The way to the pool was not well marked and it took wandering around for a while to find it. Room was great as we got one of the recently remodeled ones.,nan,1,ex710
expedia,"We celebrated our anniversary here & went to the St Patric's Day parade. The hotel was amazing! Very friendly & Attentive staff, newly remodeled, large suites and close to everything! We walked to all the must see places and only used a cab twice! Took the orange line in from the Airport & walked 2 blocks",nan,1,ex711
expedia,The staff was very friendly and the rooms were very nice,nan,1,ex712
expedia,"Great hotel. Super friendly staff. Walking distance to shopping, food, drinks...pretty much everything.",nan,1,ex713
expedia,"The Omni is located perfectly on Magnifcent Mile. Our room was recently updated and everything was new which made for a pleasurable stay. However, the air vent blew directly on our bed which was somewhat aggravating, and sleeping in the city can be noisy with sirens.",nan,1,ex714
expedia,"Staff upon arrival, Valet and luggage was terrific. Hotel is nice with a small pool.",nan,1,ex715
expedia,"If looking for a prime location on magnificent mile, the omni is the place. Kind staff and wonderful restaurant. Food was amazing.",nan,1,ex716
expedia,2nd time and excellent as usual. great restaurant at 676. Try the Walleye sandwich.,nan,1,ex717
expedia,Doormen were friendly and very efficient. Check in was quick and easy. Always my first choice of where to stay in downtown Chicago.,nan,1,ex718
expedia,"Great location with an excellent staff. Also, the pool is only 3.5 feet deep so it's great for kids. My family and I will be returning soon.",nan,1,ex719
expedia,Here for a conference. The only problem I had was the robe left in the bathroom had black streaks all over it. I just didn't use it. Otherwise everything was very clean and comfortable,nan,1,ex720
expedia,Loved the location the staff the room was great and I really the wonderful staff my kids enjoyed and had fun I will be coming back,nan,1,ex721
expedia,"My girlfriend and I had what we call a zen weekend lol. Get we from everything meditate, just relax and it was perfect although the bed was a little to0 hard for the both of us the overall rating was great. That is why the rating for the room comfort was rated what it was. I would def stay here again! Will be back soon!",nan,1,ex722
expedia,"It was a really nice hotel, check in and out was easy. They brought our bags up to our room for us. I got a suite with some people and the view was amazing. I loved being able to look out the window at all the lights. The room was very clean and the bathroom was very nice. The only thing I didn't like was that there wasn't a microwave and no forks or knives.",nan,1,ex723

expedia,I love everything easy check in and easy check out rooms are super clean and comfy definitely a 5 star,nan,1,ex727
expedia,Most comfortable hotel bed and pillows of all hotels I have stayed in around the world - crazy! I wanted to purchase the pillow from my bed - unfortunately that is not allowed.,nan,1,ex728
expedia,The food seemed to be priced high but other then that everything was great,nan,1,ex729
expedia,Great staff can't say enough. They even have a driver during the week that will drop u at museums and other close destinations. The only thing is our room furniture was really worn and out dated. It would been nice to have a couch instead of two chairs. We wold stay here again the location is absolutely perfect.,nan,1,ex730
expedia,"We stayed in a king suite, and were first booked into an older room that was desperate for an update. I called and was graciously moved to a newly renovated room on a higher floor. It was much better. Overall, I like the Omni, but I prefer to stay in the Kimpton hotels in Chicago. That said, if you're visiting Chicago, you can't beat the location.",nan,1,ex731
expedia,"I expected for the amount of money that we paid, that the room would be better. The TVs were outdated and the Decor. They charge 76 dollars for parking. That is unacceptable.",nan,1,ex732
expedia,"I suprised my husband with a trip to Chicago for his birthday. The hotel is in a good location, central to everything you could want downtown. We stayed in a higher floor which was recently renovated and looked great. Since the hotel is right on Michigan Ave, you hear everything outside even from 17+ floors up. Sirens were going off at all hours of the night which made for the worst sleep we ever had. On top of that, the construction people were renovating floors above us and we hear them working starting at 7 AM. The staff were great and very friendly! Gym was one of the best I have used. I was just disappointed how much noise you could hear.",nan,1,ex733
expedia,WE HAD A GREAT TIME! GREAT LOCATION! WE WILL BE BACK FOR SURE.,nan,1,ex734
expedia,The staff was extremely friendly and the room were nicely appointed.,nan,1,ex735

expedia,"I enjoyed our stay. The room layout and cleanliness was excellent. The hotel itself while still very good is starting to show some wear and tear. Nothing bad, it is just that it does not feel fresh anymore. Some scuff marks in the hallway and the like. But a very enjoyable stay overall. Also, excellent location and service.",nan,1,ex737
expedia,no free wifi,nan,1,ex738
expedia,Nice and clean room. A little small though. Freindly staff however need to improve in room wifi.,nan,1,ex739
expedia,"Super friendly staff, suite type rooms, great comfy bed. Would have preferred not to spend $5 on a glass of cranberry juice (the beer was $4) but overall a very nice hotel. Highly recommended.",nan,1,ex740
expedia,"We LOVED our stay at the Chicago Omni....ONLY 1 or 2 drawbacks. The hotel failed to tell us about the $100 deposit for ""incidentals"" but after speaking with the manager we quickly worked around that, and the hotel also failed to tell us that we could drop our luggage off at the hotel prior to the 3pm check in time, so we lugged all our stuff around with us =( The hotel staff was extremely nice, room was nice and clean....not too bad considering we were not in one of the newly renovated rooms (however, we'll make sure we are for our next trip) The location was PERFECT!! 2 blocks walk from the American Girl Place, pool area was FABULOUS! We LOVED our stay at the OMNI and will DEFINATELY be staying there the next time we travel to Chicago. I HIGHLY recommend this hotel =)",nan,1,ex741
expedia,The valet and doorman staff were the friendliest!!! The front desk seemed bothered by our request for a fan. Pool and hot tub area clean and quiet. The milk and cookies brought to our room for the kids was a nice touch!,nan,1,ex742
expedia,"We were very disappointed at this omni hotel. For starters, this hotel looked like it needed a renovation before anything. This place is considered a 4 star hotel,and our suite had an old box television in it that couldn't even be watched. They told us they had 24 room service so we ordered a late night snack that we never even received. All in all, I stay at Omni hotels all across the country and I thoroughly enjoy doing so, but this is an Omni I don't believe I'm ever visiting again.",nan,1,ex743
expedia,"My daughter and I went for a girls weekend and the hotel was perfect. Great location for shopping and restaurants, we could walk everywhere we wanted to go. Very ckean, comfortable and staff was helpful and friendly.",nan,1,ex744
expedia,The neighbor in the room next to us was so loud we had to call security. We will not stay at the Omni again!,nan,1,ex745
expedia,Bathtub was dirty with hairballs. They had a big group on both sides of us that ran between the rooms and we're loud.,nan,1,ex746
expedia,"We arrived at 5:30 and our room wasn't ready. We had to stay in the hotel restaurant, with two young kids, for 3 hours until it was ready. They initially gave us a $30 voucher, which was enough for an appetizer and a glass of wine. They also would not give us any estimate of how long it would be until our room would be ready, so we were in limbo the whole time. When we got to the corner suite it was quite cold. Even though the thermostat read 71 degrees, I think it was in the lower 60s. I had to turn the heat up to 80 for it be be comfortable. Even so, cold air poured from the windows onto the bed in the bed room and I woke up with cold ears. In addition, parking is outrageous - $67 a night - and it takes them the full 15-20 they estimate to get your car for you. For a hotel with this reputation I expected much, much more.",nan,1,ex747
expedia,"Great location, easy access. I recommend parking across the street at the Chicago Place... roughly half the price of valet at the hotel.",nan,1,ex748
expedia,A trip to Chicago for NewYears Eve night for my husband and I. We have stayed here several times and enjoy the comfort of the Omni. The staff here are always so friendly and very attentive. Make sure you try the breakfast brunch. It is delicious and all food is brought in from neighboring farms.,nan,1,ex749
expedia,Great location amazing staff lovely room comfortable beds awesome bar delicious buffet breakfast,nan,1,ex750
expedia,"I travel often for business and our family spends 3-5 weekends in Chicago each year. The Omni has a 3:00 check in. We arrived at 2:30 and was told our room wouldn't be ready until 3 or 3:30. No problem. We did a bit of shopping, but with an 8 year old in tow in cold weather, we returned to the hotel lobby at 3:30. We didn't get our room key until 4:40 p.m. The front desk personnel repeatedly told me that housekeeping was working off of a master list and there wasn't anything they could do. We entered room 502 in complete darkness. The entry alcove had a silver plate covering where there used to be a light. The light switch didn't turn on any lamps, and the lamp next to the couch wasn't working. The drapes were drawn as the cord was broken, so we couldn't open it to get more light. I have never stayed in such a dimly lit room. You literally had to strain your eyes to search through the luggage. The room was in dire need of updating. The carpet was incredibly worn. The sofa sleeper was low rate. It looked like one you would purchase for a college dorm room. To say we were disappointed would be a huge understatement. I would never stay at the Omni Chicago again.",nan,1,ex751
expedia,"Not clean, outdated. Custmer service was very good though.",nan,1,ex752
expedia,"Where do I start. For a room to cost $179 before tax, hotel fees and parking I reall expected more. So I'll start with the positives, the location was great, we were able to check in an hour early, and it has a pool. The unfortunate side, I picked up the room when we arrived, the bed was terribly uncomfortable, the toilet was dirty, the outlets in the room were not functioning properly, the pool area was completely trashed - there were plastic cups littering the bottom of the pool, there were used towels scattered all over the area, there were no clean towels and we had to use the hand towels from the fitness area, two calls were made for towels and after 30 minutes we still did not see new towels. Fortunately for us we were able to use our Rewards money towards this stay, however, I would say the $87 it cost us out of pocket is all this stay was worth. We will not be staying here again.",nan,1,ex753
expedia,"My daughter and I met her best friend and mother for a girl's weekend in Chicago and we had a very positive experience. None of us had ever been, so we relied on the concierge for recommendations. Amiri was very friendly and took his time giving us recommendations for fun things to do and interesting places to eat. Every member of the staff that we interacted with were friendly and helpful. The room was very spacious and clean and they even left cookies in the room at night for the girls, which they loved!",nan,1,ex754
expedia,"The only complaint I have is that our check in time was delayed by 2 hours. And at first, yes that was frusterating but the hotel is magnificent. Very comforting and clean, and makes you feel right at home. It's right on the magnificent mile which makes it all the better. The hotel staff was super helpful and very attentive. I would definitely go back here with family or friends. I highly recommend this hotel.",nan,1,ex755
expedia,"7:30pm checkin finally, room not ready. My kid found a shot glass on the ledge behind the drapes. Extremely noisy with no soundproofing between rooms. Don't look at the pictures online. They're lies. $70 parking not included. No fridge or microwave in suites. Pool is a large bathtub",nan,1,ex756
expedia,"Very disappointed and overpriced for a 4 1/2 star hotel being in Magnificent Mile. It was more like a 2 star hotel to me. Full size beds instead of queen, and a sofa that felt like sitting on a rock. The bathtub was filthy and the view was terrible. Never again will I waste my money at The Omni, and I will look at other websites to find better deals.",nan,1,ex757
expedia,It was cool until some of the fixtures started to fall off in the room but for the most part it was cool,nan,1,ex758
expedia,"Wonderful room, excellent location. However, our room was not ready by the 3pm check in time. We had to wait another 2 hours until our room was ready. Staff wasn't that concerned with the problem and had no sense of urgency.",nan,1,ex759
expedia,Great location and friendly staff but the condition of the rooms leave a lot to be desired. Parking is more expensive than other hotels and they charge for wifi. There are plenty of hotels that are much nicer and less expensive within a few blocks.,nan,1,ex760
expedia,Beautiful property with comfortable rooms and exceptional bed comfort.,nan,1,ex761
expedia,"A quick get away to visit Chicago before Christmas, location is great, convenient to shopping and restaurants. The room was spacious and very clean, the staff was extremely friendly and helpful from the doorman to the front desk. The breakfast buffet should not be missed, very tasty and high quality. We will return to this hotel on our next visit.",nan,1,ex762
expedia,"The hotel is getting a bit rundown. Our carpet was ripped, doors falling apart, wallpaper coming off the wall, tub fixtures not working well, etc...they can only put so much lipstick on it before they should repair things. The room was big and comfortable enough. The service was fine, but expected more from the concierge - not super helpful. The restaurant was fabulous! We will go back there even if we don't stay at the hotel.",nan,1,ex763
expedia,This hotel is dated and urgently needs renovation. The double beds are small and uncomfortable.,nan,1,ex764
expedia,Have stayed in Downtown Chicago for Christmas for the past 20 years but never at the Omni. Got a special rate for 3 nights and booked 4 rooms. The rooms were great since they had a separate area for the bedroom with a door between...was very handy. Only downside to the hotel was the parking rate...$65 + tax to park a car...which was about half of what the room rate was. That was crazy.,nan,1,ex765
expedia,The hotel staff took great care of us. I think this was the highlight of the hotel. Our room was spacious. The hotel restaurant was great for dessert and drinks.,nan,1,ex766
expedia,"This hotel is located in the perfect spot - right in the middle of the Magnificent Mile. It was a little strange at first to not walk into a big hotel lobby, but it really wasn't a big deal to take the elevators up to the spacious lobby. The concierge was very helpful. The members of the hotel staff were all friendly. Everyone treated us like we were their only guest. The pool isn't huge, but it's perfect for a quick swim and the whirlpool is nice too! Overall though, our choice for this hotel was to be on the Magnificent Mile (which we had a view of from our room)...and this hotel was just perfect for everything we needed! It's close to everything and right in the center of the action. Loved it and would definitely stay here again!",nan,1,ex767
expedia,"I expected a little more attention to detail in a hotel of this rating (decor, overall cleanliness, soap dish in shower was not clean). But overall, a nice hotel.",nan,1,ex768
expedia,"Great location! Hotel is clean, restaurant is excellent and staff is friendly.",nan,1,ex769
expedia,"Everything was great. We had one issue though. We arrived late at about 1:00 am.We had already paid in full by credit card. We were surprised that the receptionist was rude. She said: "" Ididn't know you were coming!!! You have to wait for 20 mnts for me to get you a room"". We thought this was outrageous. You could give any message, but you can present it POLITELY!!! This is a very nice hotel and it would be a great idea to have nice and polite receptionist. When people come for vacations the last thing that they need is to deal with an impolite employee in their hotel.",nan,1,ex770
expedia,We loved the location. My daughters loved having a pool at the hotel. We'll stay again.,nan,1,ex771
expedia,"A good hotel in a great location for shopping and business in Chicago. Stayed in a premium suite with wife and daughter right before Christmas. Hotel is a little dated in furnishings, but great staff and amenities.",nan,1,ex772
expedia,Stayed 5 days during Christmas. Friendly stafff Fffff Differ Fffd,nan,1,ex773
expedia,"The staff at the hotel was phenomenal!!! Friendly, polite, helpful! We had a great stay!",nan,1,ex774
expedia,"The hotel was very conveniently located at the heart of Chicago's Magnificent Mile. The stores and restaurants we were interested in were just a few blocks away. We've stayed at many hotels over time, but the service here really stood out. It was little things like a polite staff, offering us complimentary use of umbrellas since we were going for a walk and it was raining or complimentary dvd rental. The lobby was beautiful and modern and I expected the same of our suite. However, though it was a very nice room, the carpet had a tear and I found a hair in the bathroom before it had been used by me. Overall, we had a great experience and would be happy to stay here again.",nan,1,ex775
expedia,Really well organized and helpful. Great Christmas time help.,nan,1,ex776
expedia,"I have stayed at the Omni in the past. Nice classy suites, Very comfy beds and furniture. I did need to call about batteries for one of the remotes. Housekeeping replaced them in minutes. Great room service menus for late at night.",nan,1,ex777
expedia,"The Omni consistently offers exceptional customer service, clean comfortable rooms, and the perfect location for a romantic getaway or family fun trip. The concierge is helpful, the front desk is friendly, the rooms are spacious and clean, and the location is perfect. The restaurant is very good, and the service is top notch. It is centrally located to shopping, restaurants, public transportation, and landmarks. I really can't say enough nice things about this hotel, I absolutely love it!!!",nan,1,ex778
expedia,"The Omni felt like being at home. Roomy and with a sitting area separate from the bedroom which makes for a just like being at home feeling. Staff was pleasant, attentive and accommodating.",nan,1,ex779
expedia,my husband I I stayed at the Omni on a romantic getaway from the suburbs. The hotel staff were very friendly and accommadating- especially in regards to storing our luggage before and after checking in and out.,nan,1,ex780
expedia,"This was our second stay at the Omni. Once again, the staff was very friendly and we had outstanding service. The location on Michigan is great. The Omni is by far the most exceptional hotel we have stayed at in Chicago.",nan,1,ex781
expedia,Beautiful room. Needs a better view. Great pool. Drinks too $$$,nan,1,ex782
expedia,"Nice hotel, great location, very friendly staff, nice exercise facility. Sign up for their loyalty program to get free Internet. Much cheaper parking available at 161chicago ave, about two blocks away. Use spot hero app/web site for best rates.",nan,1,ex783
expedia,"My wife and I were in Chicago to do some Christmas shopping. The location of the Omni was perfect. The hotel is smack dab in the middle of the ""Mag-Mile"" and made getting to and from all the stores we wanted visit extremely convenient. There were a couple of drawbacks, though. Although the general hotel staff members were very pleasant, the wait staff in the hotel bar were slow and disengaged. We dropped by the bar to have a couple of drinks with a friend of my wife. The bar was fairly empty. We didn't get a waiter for nearly 10 minutes. The waiter finally showed up when I went to the bar to order drinks directly from the bartender. Then, we had to track him down each time we wanted another drink. Having worked in the hospitality business for a number of years, I'm abundantly aware of how important it is to create a positive consumer experience for guests. It's obvious that this philosophy has not been taught to the bar staff of the Omni. Onto the room. It was exactly as promised. Clean, spacious and looking over Michigan Ave. Great view. On the other hand, the room was EXTREMELY cold. Even with the heat placed at 84 degrees, the room would only reach a temperature of 63 degrees. Other than those two items, the Omni was a fantastic place to spend a couple of days to our kids inheritance on Christmas gifts for our granddaughter.",nan,1,ex784
expedia,"Mycket trevligt hotell till bra pris, centralt i Manchester.",nan,1,ex785
expedia,"Wonderful central location for shopping, NavyPier, Hancock, dining and night life. Desk staff and baggage handlers top notch. Best to just park car and Taxi to destinations.",nan,1,ex786
expedia,"This is the 4th or 5th time we have stayed at this hotel. It seems a little worn and the beds seemed a little worse for wear. I requested a week prior to arrival that a cake be in the room upon our arrival to celebrate a birthday and it wasn't there. I then asked about it, requested a later delivery time and it still wasn't there. It finally appeared after we returned from a late evening out. The location is excellent and other than the cake incident the staff is very friendly and accommodating (they even had umbrellas for us to use when it was raining). I also question the room size, I opted to spend a little more for a larger suite and the room we were put in wasn't as spacious as some of the others we had stayed in previously. If you need a hotel with a suite style set up and a fold out bed in a separate room this is a good choice.",nan,1,ex787
expedia,Rooms are a bit dated but generally comfortable and nice. Very stately feel.,nan,1,ex788
expedia,Room was very nice. I had to add a roll away bed and the only complaint would be is that the sheets were not very soft.,nan,1,ex789
expedia,"Hotel was fully booked and there were many late check outs. Had to wait for room to be cleaned, the front desk made up for it by providing breakfast buffet coupons.",nan,1,ex790
expedia,Beautiful hotel with great amenities. The bar was very nice and had a great drink selection. The hotel was in a convenient location for shopping and dining.,nan,1,ex791
expedia,Very nice stay. Staff was superior and helpful.,nan,1,ex792
expedia,"Great location. The staff was wonderful. We enjoyed drinks at the bar. Food was amazing. The ONLY negative I would have if I had to give any would be that the pillows are very uncomfortable, however the bed itself was super comfortable. And the room was very dry. We both woke up with sore throats and stuffy noses. But overall the Omni was amazing. We will definitely be back.",nan,1,ex793
expedia,"While my experience at Omni Chicago wasn't exceptional, it did meet my expectation. Staff was friendly and efficient. Lobby was located on the second floor which you need to take the elevator to get to. If you arrive at a good time when concierge is not too busy, someone would direct you to the right place. During my stay I have encountered some lost/confused arriving guests looking for the well hidden lobby. Perhaps a little signage would help. Rooms was comfortable. I have no complaints with the bedding and linen. Internet is free if you register for their free selected guest program.",nan,1,ex794
expedia,"We have stayed at this Omni countless times and we enjoy the staff and property every time. Kudos to the hotel restaurant revisions and management. Great upgrades and food quality. Now, about the room..the door thresholds underneath the doors are worn and the gaps allow so much hallway noise into the room. In addition, the doors close so loudly that the room vibrates. Not fun. We are from Florida and visited in Winter. We actually turned the heat off and had to open the windows to get a comfortable temperature in the room in order to sleep. Ceiling fan over bed may help? Our room needed a new mattress pronto, and new bedding. A good fitted sheet at the very least.",nan,1,ex795
expedia,"Everything lived up to expectations. Just wish that for a king suite there were at least a second chair, something a little more comfortable for the stay beside one desk chair.",nan,1,ex796
expedia,Went to Chicago for a family gathering at thanksgiving. Omni had a great location on magnificent mile.Hotel needs some updating which I was told was beginning shortly so it would be my top choice when that is completed,nan,1,ex797

expedia,Very nice,nan,1,ex803
expedia,We had a lovely stay at your hotel. Rooms were very comfortable and relaxing.....I would definitely stay at the Omni again.....,nan,1,ex804
expedia,The refrigerator was hot and the TV in the bedroom wasn't working. The carpet in the room needed change because it was torn.,nan,1,ex805
expedia,"I'm a repeat customer, almost every time I go to Chicago I stay at this hotel. Location is great, service is excellent, rooms are clean. Ideal for the business traveler. Rooms are small suites. Great breakfast buffet for the price, great value.",nan,1,ex806
expedia,"Excellent staff, makes for an enjoyable stay and they rate a 10. Facility show it in cleanliness, restaurant and bar service and front desk. Location gives access to Michigan Ave. even on a weather changing cold days in Nov.",nan,1,ex807
expedia,Good value for money,nan,1,ex808
expedia,We stayed at the Omni for 5 nights and it was wonderful to have the extra space that the suite provided. The room was very functional and comfortable. We also took advantage of the fitness center and it was great! The staff was very helpful/pleasant. We have stayed at many hotels in the area and the Omni is my favorite.,nan,1,ex809
expedia,"I had a great stay at the Omni, would stay there again. Close to shopping and restaraunts.",nan,1,ex810
expedia,"We had an all around fabulous experience at Omni, from the bellman, front desk staff to the wonderful cleaning and maintence crew. Thank you Omni, we will be returning!",nan,1,ex811
expedia,Having a suite is certainly a plus however the sliding doors between the bedroom and bathroom create both a lack of privacy and make a great deal of noise if using the bathroom in the middle of the night. Asked for a room on an upper floor. Ended up on the 10th floor with a view of an adjacent wall. Room was in need of an update. Overall not a bad stay but also not a particularly good value for the money.,nan,1,ex812
expedia,"Enjoyed the one night stay. Courteous staff, clean room and a huge King Suite for a reasonable price. Close to a lot of nice restaurants. Would definitely stay at the same hotel again",nan,1,ex813
expedia,Love this place! Great location! Awesome Brunch A+,nan,1,ex814
expedia,"Great location on Michigan Avenue. Spacious rooms, very clean. Polite staff. I recommend it! The hotel does not have a lobby on the ground floor, small inconvenience, you have to take the elevator to the third floor lobby. Bring good earplugs, Michigan Avenue is very loud at night, but all the major hotels are in the same street.",nan,1,ex815
expedia,"Hotel staff was phenomenal, 676 restaurant was good also, server charlie is the best.",nan,1,ex816
expedia,My stay was ok wish it could of been better since i went there to celebrate my birthday. When we got there they didnt have our room ready. We had to go sit in their restaurant and wait for 1 hour. They did give us a $30 voucher to use but we had dinner reservation somewhere else. We finally decided to go ask if we can get our room. They said they werent done cleaning it. We told them we had dinner reservation that we need to get ready for. So they finally gave us a room. When we got into the room my sister went to go take a shower and the towel felt like it was use already. We had to call house keeping for new towels and also on top of that we had to keep calling for our luggage to be sent to our room. Oh yeah there was still a light bulb they need to fix in our room and the guy kept coming in and out of our room. The top pillow was dusty. I think this should of been deal with before the weekend had started if they know they were going to be busy. Also the room should of been clean/fix before check in time. I dont think the stay there was worth $3xx.xx a night. I Wouldnt recommend this hotel to anyone.,nan,1,ex817
expedia,Disappointed in accommodations. Coffee supplies in room sparse. Robes old & too small & i am smaller than average. Tv in bedroom from the 90's & terrible angle for someone laying in bed. Very uncomfortable couch. Room not cleaned ubtil 4:30pm.,nan,1,ex818
expedia,Rude and unhelpful staff. Outdated and unclean rooms. Only positive is location but many other hotels nearby to chose from.,nan,1,ex819
expedia,Bed was comfortable but should be a King. Closet too small/ short. Bedding was great but ceiling too low. I loved the suite so I can read while others sleep. TV in bedroom was an antique. Everything very clean.,nan,1,ex820
expedia,"We were booked into what appeared to be a ""handicapped room"" that was suite. Nice and roomy. The only complaint was the small closet hanging rack was very low and there was a large privacy safe below it. There was almost no room to hang clothes so we hung some on bathroom wall hooks. Other than that the location and amenities were great.",nan,1,ex821
expedia,Went for Pack Expo. Great location. Very dated hotel. Staff was outstanding. They are remodeling the staff said this winter.,nan,1,ex822
expedia,"great location, clean, staff was very friendly.",nan,1,ex823
expedia,Wonderful stay in Chicago. We arrived early in the morning and a room was available. We enjoyed the some shopping and restaurants. We took the train into the city from O'Hare but used Uber for our return.,nan,1,ex824
expedia,"Rooms are much smaller than they seem in the pictures... especially on Expedia, the pictures are very flattering. Furniture/Amenities are outdated. Valet staff is warm and friendly, everyone else gives off the 'big city, I don't care, Chicago attitude'. Given a towel with a chewing gum-like substance on it. Overall not worth the money or hassle. I expected much more from downtown Chicago.",nan,1,ex825
expedia,We stayed at this hotel for 3 nights & had a great trip. The location is so perfect central to everything. We didn't use our car the entire time we were able to walk or grab a short cab ride. The hotel staff was very accomodating & attentive to our requests. The room decor is starting to get a bit dated but not a big deal.,nan,1,ex826
expedia,"Quick overnight trip. Stayed in double bed suite with 4 people total. Very close to lots of things. Hotel was comfortable and nice. If you are looking for great city views, then probably not your place. Very nice end of town. Always felt safe. Parking a little tricky but not bad for Chicago.",nan,1,ex827
expedia,"Omni tends to be a great but perhaps too often overlooked option in downtown Chicago. Having stayed in probably 20 Chicago hotels over the past 10-15 years, many higher end, I think the Omni is a great intersection of comfort, location, service, and price. Particularly if you are part of their loyalty program, little things like free internet (which should really be routine just about everywhere but isn't), complimentary coffee/tea/juice service in the morning (delivered to your door), and other small amenities put the Omni very near the top of my most favored places to stay, at least if I'm paying for it.",nan,1,ex828
expedia,"Great location, hotel charges are quite high for drinks and food - but plenty of places to eat out",nan,1,ex829
expedia,"The Omni was perfect in every way for our stay..we had a room on the 25th floor..amazing views.! The hotel was in easy reach of shops of every kind, restaurants, bars and places of interest. The room was most comfortable and the housekeeping staff called each evening to offer extra supplies. The bar and restaurant facilities were convenient and very nice..and while we did not have a chance to use the leisure facilities .. it was a nice option at the hotel. The hotel staff were efficient, courteous and most helpful at all times. Altogether our experience was very positive and we would highly recommend the Omni when visiting Chicago.",nan,1,ex830
expedia,Couples weekend get away. Always enjoy Michigan Ave and surrounding area. The staff at the hotel were nice. The room could use some updating/remodeling. Overall a nice stay at a competitive rate.,nan,1,ex831
expedia,This is an amazing downtown hotel. You can walkout to the best of Chicago. Food shopping gakkeries. Why the parking is twice what it cost locally to park.,nan,1,ex832
expedia,A return trip. Love the hotels location!,nan,1,ex833
expedia,"dirty. needed cleaned once we saw condition. super expensive even for basic coffee in the morning. $3 for small cup, no refill or even refresh. Small bottle of water in room = $10.00. Tube TV in the room....no really, a TUBE TV. What a joke",nan,1,ex834
expedia,Great overall!,nan,1,ex835
expedia,My daughter and I were impressed with the Omni hotel and staff. We were even more impressed and honored when we saw that they offer gluten free options on their in-room dining menus. This was very helpful with our food restriction needs. We will be back!,nan,1,ex836

expedia,"Great location to all shopping and POI near Magnificent Mile. Beautiful Contemporary rooms,with comfortable beds. Great flat screen TV in living area need similar in the bedrooms, and perhaps a more comfortable chair.",nan,1,ex840
expedia,Hotel stay was fine but rooms are overpriced for what you get. I was disappointed in ambiance and lack of any extras. Paying $400+/night should at least buy you free wireless access. Would not stay here again for the price.,nan,1,ex841
expedia,"This hotel is very well located on North Michigan Ave. The room was big and comfortable. We did not eat in the hotel, we preferred to eat out including breakfast so I cannot comment on the food. Check in staff were polite and helpful. I would definitely recommend this hotel for its great location.",nan,1,ex842
expedia,Great to everything and great location. All personel where very greeting and was safe. By far the best hotel I've stayed at. The most beautiful views of River North you can ever see unless you live in a condo high rise in the area. It gives you a new perspective of how beautiful Chicago is.,nan,1,ex843
expedia,Very nice neighborhood would stay here again!!! My only suggestion room s are dark.,nan,1,ex844
expedia,"This was a three day sight seeing stopover. We had a suite on high floors which had a nice view and was very comfortable and quiet. Room servicing was a bit erratic. Two days theturn down service appeared far too early. We were not given water each day, and twice had to ask for tea and coffee to be replaced as it had been forgotten. Valet parking at the hotel costs an eye watering $60 a day, so self park in the garage on the next block for $34 a day providing you are leaving your car in the garage and not going in and out. Get a bus pass from Wallgreen's a few yards across the road for $10/15 a day and use the bus and rail loop to get round town. Its very easy and avoids parking problems when at the sights. Restaurant in the hotel had limited and rather dull sounding menu, but we did eat there one evening, and in reality the food tasted great.",nan,1,ex845
expedia,"Great location, everything within walking distance - shopping, great pizza, Portillo's for hot dogs and Italian beef, Holy Name Cathedral, the Bean...everythingust about! Nice little bar, attentive service, very sweet ladies who take care of our room.",nan,1,ex846
expedia,"my stay was not very good even close to terrible. I was given a room that did not have closet space for me to hang of my suits, slacks or jacket. On returning to my room the first night of my stay I found my door a jarred. On the second night I did not have a plastic cover for the ice bucket. I went down to the front desk and asked the manager for one. He said they would send it right up. I never got one even though I stayed two more days. The hotel was too expensive for these experiences",nan,1,ex847
expedia,Loved it. Our room was large and very comfortable. Great bar/lounge area.,nan,1,ex848
expedia,The Omni was perfectly located on Michigan Ave for our tourist purposes. We could easily walk or take the bus to all of our destinations. They even offered us a ride whenever we got ready to walk out of the door. The doorman could not have been nicer or more helpful!,nan,1,ex849
expedia,Had a quick over night stay- great hotel! The restaurant was very enjoyable and we had a fantastic meal there. Only 1 compkaint- $65 valet parking.,nan,1,ex850

expedia,"Four of us met in Chicago from Michigan and Oregon. WE needed a suite, because we did not want to sit on beds all of the time. The room was nice. We felt that there could be another comfortable chair, so all of us could be comfortable. The location was GREAT!",nan,1,ex852
expedia,"Overall great stay. The hotel is right in the center of the ""magnificant mile"" making it easy to get just about anywhere. I walked everywhere I needed to go. There were several nice restuarants in the area. The hotel's restaurant looked very nice and had a very interesting menu, although I did not eat there. Hotel seemed pretty standard for a 4 star. All rooms were suites, which makes them seem a little bigger. I did not get a chance to check out the hotel's pool or gym. The front desk staff, bellhops, and maids were all very nice and provided good service. I would stay here again",nan,1,ex853
expedia,"The Omni Chicago is an excellent, all-suite hotel located on the Magnificent Mile. A perfect location to explore/discover Chicago! We stayed 4 nights and had a great experience.",nan,1,ex854
expedia,Overall the stay was very nice. It was a great choice to celebrate our anniversary and the chocolate cake was wonderful.,nan,1,ex855
expedia,"The hotel was in a great location. The staff was friendly. The hotel was nice, but had a corporate feel. Overall a decent stay for a weekend.",nan,1,ex856
expedia,"My husband and I decided to stay at the Omni because it is central to everything in Chicago. I have been to other Omni hotels and was really expecting it to be top notch. I was wrong. The decor is very outdated. The room was a decent size and I liked the separate living area and wet bar but again, it just was completely unattractive. The reason my ratings were somewhat harsh is as follows: they do not put fitted sheets over their mattresses.. or they didn't in our room at least. There is literally nothing grosser than waking up laying on a BARE HOTEL MATTRESS. Absolutely disgusting. I have traveled a bit and never encountered that.",nan,1,ex857
expedia,"This hotel needs to be renovated, we were very disappointed by the appearance of our room and the staff were not able to offer us a room of a more modern appearance. They offered us to switch, which we did, but even the room offered was still very tired looking.",nan,1,ex858
expedia,"The Omni is beautiful, the service is great, the location was perfect for us. The only negative for us was the length of time it took for the valey to retrieve our car, even with advance calling, we waited 15+minutes each time.",nan,1,ex859
expedia,"This by far was the best hotel we have stayed at off Michigan Avenue. Food, shopping, nightlife were all within walking distance. Will definitely be back!",nan,1,ex860
expedia,"We were pleased with our stay at Omni Chicago Hotel in late September, 2014. I am allergic to Down feathers and requested special bedding. Fortunately, the Omni has an entire floor for such situations. (the 21st floor).The room was clean, comfortable, and had a lovely partial view of the Lake and the surrounding area. The staff was so helpful and friendly.",nan,1,ex861
expedia,This was the best stay. We were close to everything and the everyone at the hotel was exceptionally nice. We will definitely stay here again or rather every time we are in Chicago,nan,1,ex862
expedia,Close to theaters and restaurants which is why we went downtown.,nan,1,ex863
expedia,"This was an expensive hotel. ln the end it seemed like I got ripped off. There are certainly better options. It wasn't bad, just didn't seem worth the money to me.",nan,1,ex864
expedia,"Great location, big and comfortable room. Would stay there again. The rug in our room could was a bit worn. Overall, great hotel.",nan,1,ex865
expedia,En general muy buena,nan,1,ex866
expedia,"My husband and I recently stayed at the Omni for a short honeymoon trip. We enjoyed our stay immensely. The room was clean and comfortable. The concierge service helped us get tickets to the Shedd Aquarium so we would not have to wait in line. When the hotel concierge found out it was our honeymoon, they sent up complimentary champagne, chocolates and a lovely handwritten congratulatory note. The location was wonderful, right on Michigan Ave and near all the shops and restaurants we could need. If we needed to go anywhere farther away we just grabbed a taxi. It was no further than 15 min ride to most of the attractions. The only downside at all was that the bed was a bit hard for us, but we love super soft mattresses. We loved our stay!",nan,1,ex867
expedia,"We had a wonderful stay at the Omni Chicago. The rooms were very clean and staff was extremely helpful. We had to ask for towels a couple of times, but delivery was very prompt and everyone was very friendly. The pool was great and we wished we had more time to enjoy the relaxing environment!",nan,1,ex868
expedia,My room was a small suite which was comfortable with dull furnishings. Wireless network connectivity was inconsistent and sometimes poor. Completely unusable in the bedroom. Lack of accessible power points in the bedroom and the living room unless you sat at the desk. I had room service a few times and the food was very good. It is an excellent location. I found the staff were mostly disinterested although the porters and doormen were very good.,nan,1,ex869
expedia,"This location is unbeatable. It is right off Michigan avenue. The service was great and the hotel was very clean. I am surprised that they still have tube TVs in the bedroom, however, this had no impact on our trip. There wasn't sufficient space to hang our dress clothes either. All in all, I would stay again!",nan,1,ex870
expedia,The only thing bad is they only offer coffee until 6:30 am at the lobby. I had a 7 am departure so I have to buy coffee? I had used the one in the room the night before and there was not a maids cart out to get another one in the morning.,nan,1,ex871
expedia,Great location and very friendly staff! Bathrooms are a little dated and cramped in the rooms but otherwise the room was very nice. Enjoyed our stay! Loved the noon check out!,nan,1,ex872
expedia,"When I first arrived I had several bags, it took me 2 trips to get my bags from the taxi to the curb. 3 employees stood there and watched me and they were having a pleasant conversation. It took me 2 more trips to get my bags from the curb to the hotel lobby, where the person behind the front desk directed me to an elevator and told me I had to check in on the 3rd floor. The bellman was standing next to her and watched me once again make 2 trips from the lobby to the elevator and on my second back asked me if I needed help, which by this time I was almost done, so I declined his help. Once checked in and made my 2 trips again to another elevator from the front desk and made 2 trips from the second elevator to my room (since the bellman must have been too busy talking with the 3 men talking at the curb as 1 blew his whistle flagging down a unseen cab. Once in the room, the room was clean but the carpet was old and frayed, the wet bar wasn't stocked, the occasional chairs were nasty dirty on the armrest. I had to put a towel on the chair before I dared to sit down. I would not recommend spending your money at this hotel, I travel to Chicago a lot and there are much nicer hotels on the Mag Mile for less money.",nan,1,ex873
expedia,"I only stayed one night, but was oferal a great experience. Will definitely return.",nan,1,ex874
expedia,I was looking for a hotel in the area within a reasonable price and this one fulfilled my expectations.,nan,1,ex875
expedia,"went to the fitness center and the treadmills(5) did'nt work properly. mentioned to the front desk. desk clerk said she would report to engineering and next day same problem. need new machines. also a couple days there was no water in the fitness center. whirlpool/spa timer didnt work properly. Once set it just kept on going and going and going. reported this to front desk as well, to no avail. Room was ok. Nothing spectacular. This hotel used to be a real 4 star hotel dont know what happened over the last 5-10 years.",nan,1,ex876
expedia,Everything was perfect,nan,1,ex877
expedia,"I guess we got a pretty good deal coming into Chicago at the end of labor day weekend. We booked two days (Sunday and Monday), and were really happy with the price and the quality and size of our room. The bathroom was very large, and our room had a separate bedroom area from the other rooms. We decided to stay in Chicago another day, but when I went down to pay, the price jumped a hundred bucks...on a tuesday?!?!? They wouldn't budge at all, so we went around the corner and got a really nifty room for half the nightly rate we paid for each of the first two nights at Omni. Hotel pricing is weird.",nan,1,ex878
expedia,Very nice!!! Staff was so nice!! Room was nice!!,nan,1,ex879
expedia,Nice hotel in a great location in the middle of the Magnificent Mile.,nan,1,ex880
expedia,"Nice hotel next to Magnificent Miles shops, restaurants, bars and Michigan lake beach.",nan,1,ex881
expedia,"Sadly this visit wasn't like past ones. After waiting 30 minutes in our room they brought us someone else's luggage, the tv was broken and the superior corner suite was very small and noisy. I could hear every sound coming from the neighbors. When we were leaving they forgot to bring our car around. Prior visits were so much better. They just didn't seem to be on their game.",nan,1,ex882
expedia,"Great view, good size room, and housekeeping was okay. I understand she might of been upset for having to come at our door a couple of times before getting an answer, but upon our return to the room, pillows were everywhere and not on the bed as they should had been. I guess that was her way of saying she was upset with us.",nan,1,ex883
expedia,"The hotel is very well located for shopping. That being said, I wouldn't recommend it for more than a night or two at the most. We stayed 4 nights. It was too long for a hotel that turned out to be pretty funky. Reception area is on third floor, first floor just has someone pointing you to the elevators. Guests have to take two elevators in two different locations every time they want to go downstairs, weird room layout -- bathroom was almost half the suite and no door or curtain over toilet area. Rooms were quite noisy with guests running and yelling in hallways (this may be because there are so many kids in the hotel due to the American Girl store located nearby). Internet was a separate charge every day, refrigerator was unusable for guests except to buy commodities with the usual high prices, plus tax and ""restocking"" fees on every item. We felt nickled and dimed. This hotel would do better to not advertise as ""luxury."" It's an OK hotel that's quite expensive in a great part of town.",nan,1,ex884
expedia,"This hotel is very much right in the middle of all the action on the Magnificent Mile (Michigan Ave). Lots of great restaurants, shopping and attractions are within walking distance. The hotel was overall clean and comfortable. However, the carpet right in front of the elevators on the first floor is very dirty and it really needs to be replace.",nan,1,ex885
expedia,The Omni Chicago is centrally located on the Magnificent Mile but it isn't noisy. The hotel is smart - the staff polite and very helpful. The pool and spa centre are a great bonus. I would definitely recommend the hotel.,nan,1,ex886
expedia,"I really enjoyed the hotel. It was convenient to everything we wanted to do. Our room, unfortunately, backed up to a service elevator; which I would hear every morning. The bed was not as comfortable as I would have liked. Overall, the hotel was nice.",nan,1,ex887
expedia,The AC return air was caked with dust and there was hair found on the bathroom floor. Interenet acess was not free as in many other hotels.,nan,1,ex888
expedia,Very friendly staff & great service. Location is walking distance to many tourist attractions downtown. The pool and workout area is a bit on the small side but very clean. Overall it was a happy stay and recommend staying here for its great location.,nan,1,ex889
expedia,From the minute we got there until we left everything was was perfect.,nan,1,ex890
expedia,Room service was delicious and our in room couples massage was fantastic!,nan,1,ex891
expedia,"The location was nice, sofa bed was ok. Wifi only free after signing up with their Loyalty program, even then it got billed and it took me some effort to get it refunded.",nan,1,ex892
expedia,We stayed 3 nights and found the hotel to be an excellent base from which to explore the city. It has several restaurants nearby.,nan,1,ex893
expedia,"Everything about this hotel was perfect. The staff was attentive and extremely helpful. The concierge got us VIP tickets for the aquarium the day before--what a boon! The location was spectacular, right smack in the middle of the Magnificent Mile. You could throw a stone at Niketown, it was that close!",nan,1,ex894
expedia,Great hotel. Within short walking or taxi journey distance to all the main attractions. Staff very helpful and friendly.,nan,1,ex895
expedia,"Awesome location, excellent service and decent clean rooms - no complains at all....if I were to visit Chicago again it would be omni hotel. No doubt about it!",nan,1,ex896
expedia,"We loved the Omni and would return.Great staff, Clean quiet rooms and ice cold lemonade waiting in the foyer when you return to the hotel.",nan,1,ex897
expedia,Omni Is fine. Nothing fancy but clean enough and excellent location,nan,1,ex898
expedia,We liked almost everything about the hotel. The location was great - less than 100 feet off of the Magnificent Mile. Nice hotel and good sized rooms. The only thing we found strange were the elevators - you had to take one elevator from the street to the lobby and then switch to another bank of elevators to get to the floor that your room was on. They were also on the small side and felt cramped at times when there were other passengers. All in all we had a very pleasant stay.,nan,1,ex899
expedia,"The hotel is located in the heart of the city and very convenient. We stayed for three nights and would definitely stay here again. It was clean, updated, spacious and the staff was extremely helpful.",nan,1,ex900
expedia,"This is an ideal location for downtown access. Rooms are clean and spacious - beginning to look in need of a refresh. Service good - breakfast good, if a little on the expensive side.",nan,1,ex901
expedia,"Great location on Michigan avenue. Convenient to a bus stop that took us to the museum campus, museum of science and industry, and the Navy pier. Also only a few blocks from a red line station. Will definitely stay at again. Never ate at the restaurant in the hotel though. Seemed pricey to me especially with so many great Chicago restaurants close by.",nan,1,ex902
expedia,Loved hotel. But didn't like having to take 2 elevators. Registration area should be more impressive. Loved everything about hotel,nan,1,ex903
expedia,We stayed 3 nights in Chicago and this hotel was central to everything and walking distance. The room and service was very good. It was very spacious. My daughter didn't get to use the pool as it was either closed or too crowded. It was also too small for the number of guests and it didn't look to clean - the only disappointment with this hotel.,nan,1,ex904
expedia,"The room was clean and comfortable, and the staff were really nice. Loved the layout of the room - very convenient if one of you is an early riser and the other is not! The restaurant was pricey (breakfast for 2 with tip ran $60), but was good. We opted to eat outside of the restaurant for the rest of the trip. Try L'Appetito (in the lower courtyard of the Hancock Tower) for breakfast or lunch. Great food, very reasonable prices (full breakfast, without beverage, was $5.50).",nan,1,ex905
expedia,my friends and I stayed at the Onmi Chicago Aug I was a fantastic hotel in the heart of Chicago. Convenient to everything from shopping to food to a short subway ride to Wrigley. SPECIAL shout out to the hotel bar. Absolutely fabulous service and very charming young lady!!!,nan,1,ex906
expedia,Stayed 2 adults and 2 children ages 13/10 booked bigger room with sofa bed and 2 queens worked out well. Good location for John Hancock centre and pier metro easiest for city art and went to white socks game on metro. Kids liked pool and gym in hotel. Recommend hiring cycles from along the river and then cycling south down lakeside. Car parking ultra expensive at hotel so we picked up vehicle for rest of our trip at Alamo downtown after checking out of hotel which worked out well,nan,1,ex907
expedia,"It seemed a bit bland when we checked in - we stayed 4 nights and liked it more each day. The location is very handy - can walk to everything downtown, and the pool, while short, is marked for swimming laps and the pool room is very nice. Even when there were a few kids in the pool, there was still room to swim laps, which is nice because most hotels have a pool so narrow that you can't have multiple users. Didn't like not having a refrigerator in the room that we could use, and had a glass of wine at the bar that was $15, so bought a bottle after that. Enjoyed the trip.",nan,1,ex908
expedia,"During my recent stay, I noticed my duvet cover had makeup smudges. I called guest services and requested mine be changed. Not only did I receive a new duvet cover, but the head of housekeeping changed it personally. He also provided a voucher for breakfast in one of the hotel's restaurants! He went the extra mile to correct the situation, which I truly appreciated!",nan,1,ex909
expedia,"Great location, great river viewing rooms, but the hotel is very old",nan,1,ex910
expedia,This hotel is extremely nice. We loved the view from our room and the pool. It is fun to watch all the boats on the river.,nan,1,ex911
expedia,We stayed two nights and really enjoyed it. The room was very comfortable - good size beds and great bedding. Ample space. Very quiet!,nan,1,ex912
expedia,Very nice! Close to the NBC studio which we had tickets to the Steve Harvey Show.,nan,1,ex913
expedia,"The hotel is very conveniently located near millennium park and the river and has a nice view of the city. However, I thought that for the price you pay, you should at least have wifi connection.",nan,1,ex914
expedia,Room was comfortable and the beds very comfortable. The riverside location meant that all of the key sites were accessible on foot. Overall a pleasant experience.,nan,1,ex915
expedia,Perfect to vacation meting close all you want to do,nan,1,ex916
expedia,Good location. A lot of nice restaurants and bars in the area. Used taxi to travel back and forth from the airport so cannot say much about accessibility to public transportation. Courteous and helpful staff.,nan,1,ex917
expedia,"I very much enjoyed my stay, I went with 3 other guests for leisure. The hotel staff was very inviting and friendly. The staff upgraded our check-out time from noon to 1pm and have us free in-room internet (versus the $14.95 charge). The hotel room was somewhat small, we stayed in the traditional 2 bed room. The view was amazing and the beds were very comfortable!",nan,1,ex918
expedia,"It was very hot in our room. Called the front desk and they sent maintenance, but they said there was nothing they could do. It was set on 66, but wouldn't go past 72 so it was very hot to us. Besides that hotel was good. Expensive, but you pay for the view.",nan,1,ex919
expedia,Fine; great location and view. Guests should have access to microwave and more refrigerator space.,nan,1,ex920
expedia,"Enjoyed our stay - class act, as I expect Sheratons to be!",nan,1,ex921
expedia,It was our first time visit to Chicago. We were really happy with the hotel. Comfortable beds and very clean. The entire staff was awesome!!!!,nan,1,ex922
expedia,"Beautiful view and comfy room! We enjoyed our stay. The items in the room were pricey, but that's the case everywhere. We had a river view and it was beautiful.",nan,1,ex923
expedia,I love to travel n it was a great experience. The hotel was great,nan,1,ex924
expedia,"The majority of the staff was pleasant and the room was comfortable. The view of downtown Chicago was great. The package we purchased included breakfast for the four of us for all four days of our stay, and a fridge in our room. When we checked in, we found out that this was not the case. Four days of breakfast for four people. You do the math. We also had to pay extra for the fridge (all of this was said to be included when we made our reservations). The bathtub was drained extremely slow, so we showered in about a foot of dirty water the entire time. Fortunately they have showers at the pool. This was our first family vacation, so the above mentioned was a bit disappointing, but overall, we had a great time in Chicago.",nan,1,ex925
expedia,We brought our daughter to Chicago for the first time and she LOVED it!! We will be back this summer for sure.,nan,1,ex926
expedia,Hot in the room. Good location. Pool closed at ten which we thought should of been open later. No free wifi or breakfast,nan,1,ex927
expedia,A nice walk to shops and restaurants. Well cared for. Excellent service. Nice pool and fitness center. Good for families or business.,nan,1,ex928
expedia,i took my family to chicago for a cubs game and we spent the night before at the sheraton. beautiful building and very courteous staff.,nan,1,ex929
expedia,"It is a very nice hotel with a great location in downtown Chicago. It is so close to the Park, a walking distance to the park, to the shopping center and to the AMC theater. It will be perfect if it has the hot tub.",nan,1,ex930
expedia,Location was wonderful for seeing the Chicago sights. Our room was very clean and had a great view of the city. Staff was friendly and helpful. Valley parking was convenient and the gentlemen who brought our car each time were courteous and friendly!,nan,1,ex931
expedia,"Before retiring, I often stayed in this hotel on business. It always was a pleasant experience. Since that ws more than ten years ago, we were very happy to find that it had not declined in any way. Our room had obviously been recent refurbished and was in excellent condition. Although we had booked it for a very reasonable price, we were pleased to find that it was a corner room with lots of space and a couch and easy chair. Most outstanding was the staff; from the front desk clerk to the maid who showed me where the ice machine was, every staff member we met was courteous, pleasant and anxious to help us. What a pleasure. Located close to the loop and to N. Michigan Ave, this is a perfect place to sat in downtown Chicago.",nan,1,ex932
expedia,"Clean, good location, walk to Navy Pier, easy check in.",nan,1,ex933
expedia,"Took a short two night trip to Chicago. The hotel and rooms were nice and well kept. The hotel staff was somewhat helpful although boarderline annoying. The location of the hotel was mediocre at best. It was very hard to get to with one way streets and also very difficult to bring a car from the parking garage to the front of the hotel. Parking would be one of my biggest complaints because I have never stayed at a hotel even in NYC and Atlanta, also big cities, where parking was not provided for hotel guests. At this hotel, parking was $52 per night for a total of $102 in parking for my trip. What's worse is that I was not told about this cost ahead of time so that I could find alternatives. They also tried to charge me for using the minibar which I did not use and tried to double charge me for parking. All charges were eventually straightened out but it was a huge hassle overall.",nan,1,ex934
expedia,"Great staff, nice location & very clean! My only complaint is that there weren't any quick food options. A cafe that serves sandwiches and coffee would be a great addition!",nan,1,ex935
expedia,"Hotel was very nice, staff friendly, rooms clean and spacious.",nan,1,ex936
expedia,"Got a great deal for this excellent hotel, walking distance to Navy Pier, Giordano's Pizzeria and Macy's in Michigan Ave. The view at night from the room was espectacular, the river, the boats in the river, the skycrapers, a totsl dream!",nan,1,ex937
expedia,It was a family friendly environment. The staff were prompt and willing to help out with anything.,nan,1,ex938
expedia,"Looking for a hotel in the heart of Chicago can be tough when looking for a budget friendly, family friendly hotel with a pool. We found one in the Sheraton Chicago Hotel & Towers. The pool was perfect for our kids to play and burn energy while offering a great view of the river and city. Also the pool was open early, so our early rising kids could go swimming at 7 am. Our room was spacious and we got a great deal on it. The hotel staff did a great job and we will definitely make this hotel our first choice if ever visiting the windy city again.",nan,1,ex939
expedia,"There was no problem with the room itself or the staff, but they do try to squeeze as much money as possible out of you. To park in their garage is $61 a night. $14 per day to access the internet in your room. There is a mini-fridge packed full of drinks. The fridge has sensors so that if you remove anything you will immediately be charged a very high price. It is impossible to put any of your own food or drink into the fridge. If you even remove what they have in there, you will be charged $25. We paid $200 a night for the room, but will all the additional unexpected fees, it came to closer to $300 a night. I would not stay here again.",nan,1,ex940
expedia,"Awesome location, big hotel, comfy beds. A little disappointed for being ""punished"" by Sheraton for not booking directly through them. See no reason why that should affect me getting Starwood points.",nan,1,ex941
expedia,Great hotel. Would be better if they removed the over priced snacks from the room. I hate wondering what I can and can't touch in the hotel room because I don't know if I'll be charged. It isn't convenient having them in the room and is clearly a way for the hotel to make money.,nan,1,ex942
expedia,"it was nice, quiet, clean, excellent location and close to many sightseeing, price was reasonable.",nan,1,ex943
expedia,"Easy in easy out, quick stay. Nice place, pool for kids. Everything was great.",nan,1,ex944
expedia,"It was ok. Checking in was not welcoming at all. A positive is their rooms were good and clean. I don't approve of having to travel down another set of elevators to get with Valet and then get my car. For the daily fee of Valet parking I would expect to pick up my car up front and greeted a little better not in a dingy garage. I have pretty high expectations for this hotel due to it's location, name, and price. I've had better experiences at other hotels in Chicago. Sorry.",nan,1,ex945
expedia,"The only thing negative that happened was that on check-in the person who checked us in said we have to sign up for the internet and it says you have to pay, but the charges will come off at the end of your stay. It sounded suspicious and that was not true.",nan,1,ex946
expedia,Neighbor had very loud dog in room next to us. Only complaint,nan,1,ex947
expedia,"Rooms were very nice, comfortable bed, very clean over the 5 days we stayed there. The fitness centre and pool were very well equipped and clean and had a great view. Downside was that we couldn't keep any personal food or drink items in the fridge because, if any mini-bar items were removed, a sensor was triggered to charge the room for the item. An empty fridge could be rented but I felt that the rental fee was an exhorbitant price over 5 days. Also, there was free wireless internet available in the lobby, but there was a charge for wireless connection in the hotel rooms. I also felt this service was overpriced. The last inconvenience was the availability of restaurants in the hotel. The bistro downstairs was very nice and the breakfast food was great but it was only open for breakfast and lunch. The only restaurant in the hotel available for evening dining was the steak house, which was also very nice, and the food was excellent, but the cost of our dinner there was the same price as the room rate for 2 nights. However, the room service menu was a good value and there was a variety of food offered.",nan,1,ex948
expedia,Didn't like the fact that they have a mini-bar instead of a fridge and if you take anything out of it you are automatically charged even if you put it back. No iron or ironing board either. Also did not like that almost everything on the TV was pay per view.,nan,1,ex949
expedia,The hotel is well located and the staff is friendly. The lake view is amazing. Prices are fair.,nan,1,ex950
expedia,I stayed at the hotel for a weekend away with friends. The staff was very friendly & helpful when I inquired about places to see and eat. They even had walking instructions typed up to get to the places in walking distance. I would definitely stay there again.,nan,1,ex951
expedia,"Very nice modern hotel. Good location to shopping, Navy pier and the river north area. We were warmly welcomed and given a nice view from our room. Very clean with nice workout facilities, pool and I loved the dry sauna in the lockerroom. We stayed three days and housekeeping was excellent and all staff very friendly. The bed was SUPER comfortable. WOW. Picky things that can add up quickly - The ""goodies"" in the room on a tray were outrageously priced. If you just picked one up to look at it, a sensor automatically bills the item to your room. So be warned. Also, you are not told at check in that internet wi-fi is an extra $15 per day so unless you want to use it in your room, turn off the wifi on your smart phone after you get off the elevator. Room service very pricey and we took a pass on it. All and all we enjoyed our stay and will return.",nan,1,ex952

expedia,Wonderful had a fun and relaxing time Very fast guest service chek in and good service recommend it!,nan,1,ex958
expedia,Wanted a king room and received a double,nan,1,ex959
expedia,"Overall, nice please to stay for a couple day trip. Luckily I am a SPG member, and I did not had to deal with wifi fees, but if you are not get ready to pay some extra commodities that are free in other places. Another turn-down, is everything is quite expensive there... breakfast is not included, room services are ""crazy expensive.""",nan,1,ex960
expedia,"Our beautiful, expansive room had two flaws. The toilet wouldn't shut off after each flush, and I had to get up and jiggle the handle all night long. (My husband and I are 'frequent flyers' at night). Also, the water in the sink was sometimes slow to go down. Ick. Do hotels save flawed rooms for discount customers?",nan,1,ex961
expedia,We have stayed at many hotels in our travels but none compare to the feeling we get staying at the Sheraton. It is like our home away from home.,nan,1,ex962
expedia,"I stayed here with my wife for her birthday weekend and it was incredible. We ate at Shula's Steakhouse on Friday night, which is located inside the hotel. The view from our room was amazing, and the entire staff was very courteous. We will definitely be returning.",nan,1,ex963
expedia,There was no gift shop or vending machines available to purchase small items. The parking fees were very expensive and the conceirge desk were poorly informed and did not give correct information. Outside that the main desk personnel were excellent and the room and hotel in general were very nice and clean.,nan,1,ex964
expedia,Amazing is a great hotel everything it was perfect the room smell great,nan,1,ex965
expedia,Definitely try to get a Club Level Room!,nan,1,ex966
expedia,Wonderful,nan,1,ex967
expedia,The room was very clean and comfortable with a good view of the city. There was only one single chair besides the bed and a big empty space that could have been filled with at least another chair since there were two of us and a toddler that would have been nice. Loved the gym and swimming pool.,nan,1,ex968
expedia,Close to magnificent mile. Easy to navigate around. No gift shop or vending machines. Had to walk to Walgreens for drinks or snack so we didn't have to pay the outrageous price to eat or drink from room.,nan,1,ex969
expedia,"I go to Chicago several times a year for leisure and stay at this Sheraton. I have always been very pleased with the quality of the rooms and facilities. It's proximity to Michigan Avenue, the Chicago River and Lake Michigan make it very walkable in good weather.",nan,1,ex970
expedia,Absolutely terrific stay. Enjoyed the mid week quiet. Had the pool to myself both days but would sure have enjoyed a hot tub after skating at Millennium park! Like the option to go green and pass on housekeeping since I was there for such a short time. Exceedingly friendly staff! The only thing that might keep me away next time would be to find a hot tub!,nan,1,ex971
expedia,Front desk staff was extremely helpful The view from room very good and I love the shampoo and conditioner,nan,1,ex972
expedia,Beautiful hotel with such a lovely view and friendly staff.,nan,1,ex973
expedia,"Had a good stay in this hotel. They accommodated an early check in as i came off the train and staff were always courteous and friendly. It is a busy hotel and i did find that the interconnecting doors between rooms were not the best at dampening sound so you could hear everything happening in the next room, and I mean everything;). Apart from the noise issue the hotel delivered everything that was expected.",nan,1,ex974
expedia,"We stayed at the Sheraton Hotel for five nights to welcome the New Year. We got a great rate, considering their facilities and great location, just blocks aways from Magnificent Mile, Millennium Park and Navy Pier. The highlight of our stay: our view! Upon arrival, we were offered to join the hotel's Preferred Guest and were instantly upgraded to a room with a wonderful view to the river and the Trump tower. I would definitely recommend to stay at this Sheraton Hotel.",nan,1,ex975
expedia,"Our stay was pleasant. The room was very clean and well-decorated. It's a little disappointing to not have complimentary wireless internet like so many other hotels we have visited, but I knew going in that we wouldn't have it. I will say that the hotel seemed more geared to business travel and didn't really have that homey, personal feel that I prefer, but for the money, we felt like we got a great deal on a nice hotel in downtown Chicago close to restaurants and shopping.",nan,1,ex976
expedia,"reservations are not really much of a reservation, was put in a handicap-accessible room hotel is close to lots of places and managed the holiday crowds well (stayed over New Year's eve)",nan,1,ex977

expedia,Service at the hotel was excellent we had a baby and some needs that came along with the baby. The hotel got us a fridge and other items for no charge,nan,1,ex980
expedia,"Chicago is an amazing city and the Sheraton was an excellent hotel. The room was clean and nice and the people working the front desk were super friendly. My only negative are those little things in the rooms that have the snacks that if taken of the sensor are chared outrageously priced, to your room. We didn't use them, but they're really shady and lame.",nan,1,ex981
expedia,Loved my stay. Nice hotel without being stuffy. Enjoyable lobby to spend time in. Only complaint was the bellman was very forward in expecting a tip. It was very uncomfortable and made me not want to give one but he pretty much forced me to...personal space buddy!,nan,1,ex982
expedia,The hotel is clean and always friendly. Staff members are always there to help whenever needed too. When going to the city this is my choice of stay every time.,nan,1,ex983
expedia,"I love this hotel. The room was nice and clean, comfortable bad, everybody was helpful and friendly. Conserge gave us very good advice for places to eat and different attractions. The view and location perfect, everything close, easy with public transportation. I would recomend my friends.",nan,1,ex984
expedia,"Although it was New Years Eve and there was a lot of commotion in the hallways until about 2:00 in the morning, I'm sure circumstances are a lot different on other dates. My date and I were happy with the closeness of the restaurants and other available sites of the city to this hotel. We will be sure to be back.",nan,1,ex985
expedia,It was good overall no complaints,nan,1,ex986
expedia,"Rude staff, and the rooms are way to small, bath to small",nan,1,ex987
expedia,"Great location, friendly staff, beautiful hotel. Only complaint is no fridge in the room for personal left overs, etc (only held mini bar items).",nan,1,ex988
expedia,The front desk staff was super accommodating allowed us for early check in on 3 rooms. Always great when traveling with kids!,nan,1,ex989
expedia,The hotel could have been cleaned better during housekeeping visits and the draining wasn't so great in the shower which was kind of disgusting. The hotel itself is gorgeous and loved the location.,nan,1,ex990
expedia,Nice hotel near Millennium Park. Enjoyed the bakery for breakfast. Convenient and relaxing!,nan,1,ex991
expedia,"Great place , especially for such a good price. Room thermostat didn't seem to work well, room got a little warm.",nan,1,ex992
expedia,"It was a great location-everything was great except we had to wait until 6:00 Chicago time to check in-we arrived at 12 noon Chicago time and they said they would text me when ready-I called two times and they said not ready finally they texted me, Very upsetting-also a glass was in the hallway for 4 days the 5th day it was gone-not up to Sheraton Standards.",nan,1,ex993
expedia,"My kids and I were coming to Chicago from the north west suburbs for the day. While looking for places to go, came across a hotel deal we could not pass on. The Sheraton was the best choice. Location, ammenities and cost sealed the deal. Great decision.",nan,1,ex994
expedia,Bed and pillows were too soft for me and my wife. Overall is a good hotel with good location. I travel with my kids and it was great.,nan,1,ex995
expedia,Great location for a 3 nights stay over New Years.,nan,1,ex996
expedia,"We have stayed at this hotel many times, but this last stay had some negatives for the first time. Elevator to the Self Service parking lot was incredibly slow leaving lines of people waiting to go up or down. Housekeeping in the room was not as good as it has been in the past. Room was never vacuumed (we were there for 4 nights), they forgot to leave coffee, didn't clean the glasses. Bed was still comfortable and and the view is always the best. Its location to Navy Pier and shopping is perfect. Staff is always friendly and helpful. So I will go back again.",nan,1,ex997
expedia,Rooms aren't clean you have to beg staff to change towels and such. I enjoy the shearton in NY & SAN JUAN MUCH better !,nan,1,ex998
expedia,Super time swimming. My room was perfect and staff was awesome. My view left me speechless,nan,1,ex999
expedia,Our experience was awesome! We walked to Michigan Avenue and we had Chicago's famous deep dish pizza. Next we went swimming inside of the Sheraton. My kids had a great time!!,nan,1,ex1000

expedia,Rooms to small and vallet made damage on my new car.,nan,1,ex1003
expedia,"Hotel is just off the Mag Mile, on the riverfront. The room was large, with an excellent view. It also has the fastest elevators of any hotel I've ever been in! Frankly, everything about the hotel was good, with one exception. I had trouble communicating with one bartender - just a language issue - but another bartender stepped in to assist, and it all turned out fine.",nan,1,ex1004
expedia,"The room was a little dusty. We were in the entry level room and the room size overall was pretty small. Beds are so comfortable! Location is great, only 15-20 min walk from Navy Pier and 10 min walk from Michigan Ave. We had great views of the Trump Tower.",nan,1,ex1005
expedia,We took the family to Chicago and stayed at the Sheraton for the New Year's holiday is a great experience very competent staff. The beds are very comfortable in the room is a little small and the bathrooms could've been updated but other than that is fine,nan,1,ex1006

expedia,awesome,nan,1,ex1012
expedia,"Hotel is in excellent location and close to everything, and you get a great view of the Chicago River and Lake Michigan. Magnificent Mile is just that anytime of the year for anyone that has never been there. Free parking included in package was a big plus since downtown parking is big a rip off.",nan,1,ex1013
expedia,Overpriced for what you get. The hotel parking charge at $49 per night illustrates the very expensive fees.,nan,1,ex1014
expedia,Christmas shopping getaway in the city with family. Location convenient to Michigan Ave. Hotel has great view of the river from lobby areas & our room. Traditional room w/double beds very small. Spent most of our time in the lobby areas because the room was so small. Woke up w/banging construction noise at 7:30am.,nan,1,ex1015
expedia,Very valuable,nan,1,ex1016
expedia,It don't make u feel like u some where else,nan,1,ex1017

expedia,"We had a wonderful stay overlooking the river and city. It was close enough to walk or take a taxi. They had taxi's waiting in the front. Check in was easy. The room was beautiful and very comfortable, quiet and clean. I would highly recommend a stay here. Our family enjoyed our stay. Lobby/bar area was decorated so festive for the holidays!",nan,1,ex1022
expedia,"Beautiful spacious room with nice views to the city. Great location. Parking though is very pricy, use local lots. Pool was good but no hot tub. Nice gym.",nan,1,ex1023
expedia,"We had a great stay. Staff was very friendly, rooms were clean with plenty of towels. We loved the free shuttle to Macy's.The lounge was great. Only negative we had was the price of parking. I thought it was in my package but upon further review it was not. I will stay again but not use parking. I will use Metra or be dropped off. I definely will warn friends about the price of parking.",nan,1,ex1024
expedia,Easy walking distance to parks & shopping. Will stay again for sure!!,nan,1,ex1025
expedia,"For the price, location and hotel, I will give this 5 stars. City and river view. The only complain I had was the bath tub not draining properly and the toilet bowl not levelled. I'm sure such things can be solved easily.",nan,1,ex1026
expedia,Excellant location and value. We walked to Navy Pier and Mag Mile,nan,1,ex1027

expedia,"The room was nice and clean, and I needed extra towels and they were brought right up (little things make your day)",nan,1,ex1033
expedia,"This Sheraton always has great service and a friendly staff. I've stayed at this hotel a number of times over the years, and it continues to be a wonderful place to stay. The rooms always do feel a bit outdated and are starting to show their age in minor ways (a broken bathroom tile, a loose drawer knob, etc.) But overall, the hotel continues to be well-worth the price, considering the location (a short walk from Michigan Ave and high-end shopping), and several great restaurants both in the hotel and within walking distance.",nan,1,ex1034
expedia,"Overall nice stay. Staff was good and very easy check in and check out process. Location is good, and a quick walk to Michigan Ave. stores and dining,",nan,1,ex1035

expedia,Great service. .,nan,1,ex1042
expedia,"Stayed from Thanksgiving 11/27 until Sunday 11/30. Staff very professional, attentive and engaging. Bar staff NOT SO ATTENTIVE on all occasions (a smile would go a long way). The only reason service was given a 4 was the bar service. We had a lovely view of the city and river. This is our second Thanksgiving stay here and we will come again. Bed very comfortable. Location is great for everything.",nan,1,ex1043
expedia,The room was great and the staff was awesome. Kids love the pool. Pet friendly too.,nan,1,ex1044

expedia,Excellent. But the closet' s door are old and without color and few items in the bathroom.,nan,1,ex1046
expedia,"I think the air condition is broken, one of the fans comes out the warm wind but another one comes out cold wind. Also, the highest temperature of the air condition is 75F. The room is so cold if I did not stay in bed. Also, the elevator for the parking lot is so bad. If feels like it will stop working at any time. The room is clean and the neighborhood is good. It only takes about 5 minutes to walk to the Michigan Avenue. I think I may choose other hotels.",nan,1,ex1047
expedia,"Third stay at this hotel in Chicago. All of them over the holidays (Thanksgiving and Christmas) Great accommodations,clean, employees cannot do enough for you. A great location on the river and half block off of Michigan Avenue. A must stay in Chicago!",nan,1,ex1048

expedia,Love it. Had a really nice time. Will be back.,nan,1,ex1053
expedia,"The room was very pleasant. The bed was very comfortable, the bathroom very nice. The hotel's common areas were inviting and pleasant, with a nice view of the river and downtown.",nan,1,ex1054
expedia,"A nice big hotel in a central location. I checked in late at night and the staff at the desk was very polite and kind. The only downside would be the temperature of the room, which was a bit chilly. I wish I could raise the temperature above the maximum, which was around 78.",nan,1,ex1055
expedia,We stayed over for Thanksgiving! Great hotel location and condition! Plenty of restaurants to choose from in the hotel or walking distance from hotel! Close to shopping and movie theatre.,nan,1,ex1056
expedia,"Great metro atmosphere, located walking distance from the miracle mile. Clean room, great staff, and wonderful river view. Left an item behind after checking out, but the security staff retrieved it and had it waiting for me to pick up the next day. No complaints, will definitely stay again.",nan,1,ex1057

expedia,"About a block off of the Magnificent Mile. Next to Chicago River. Quick check in. Had breakfast room service. Hot omelet and warm toast delivered on time, but pricey breakfast.",nan,1,ex1068
expedia,the view from the room was good but their was nothing special about the room The room was NOT worth the money it costs to stay their.,nan,1,ex1069
expedia,Staff very helpful with restaurant and sight seeing information. We were very pleased with the staff.,nan,1,ex1070
expedia,"When I arrived at my room, cushions were out of place, drawers were open, there were crumbs on the floors, grease marks on the tables, and glasses that were used and not cleaned up.",nan,1,ex1071
expedia,"Comfortable, clean, great location downtown, lighting in the rooms could be better",nan,1,ex1072
expedia,I was quite disappointed about the stay. I arrived at the hotel around midnight. The first room I got had trash in both the bathroom and the bedroom. The bed wasn't made right. The sheet was dirty. I had to go downstairs and change to another room. By the time I settled it's already almost 1 am. The location was good. I was just not expecting a dirty room when I'm booking a 4-star hotel.,nan,1,ex1073
expedia,It was a short stay but perfect for my needs,nan,1,ex1074
expedia,"Great hotel. Comfortable room, good location. Only complaint was valet parking. Aside from the price, getting to claim your car on the lower level requires riding down several escalators from the lobby level. Then by happenstance, we went through an unmarked door to find our vehicle.",nan,1,ex1075
expedia,Staff incredibly polite and helpful. Rooms are very clean and great views of Chicago in any side of the hotel. Location perfect for visiting Michigan Avenue and all the touristy spots. Highly highly recommended!,nan,1,ex1076
expedia,Fantastic accommodations and extremely friendly staff.,nan,1,ex1077
expedia,Room looked nice but was run down. I had to fight to get the closet door open. The bathroom had cracked tile and rust and was dirty.,nan,1,ex1078
expedia,Great stay.,nan,1,ex1079
expedia,The rooms are out dated and need a facelift. The washroom is so dated I don't believe it has been touched since the hotel opened in 1992. The lighting in the room was awful. The safe requires a key not electronic. The closet has a light on a string to turn on and off....not what I call a 4 star hotel. Rooms are noisy due to solid steel doors closing. Not a 4 star hotel at all. Very disappointed for the price I paid was not a 4 star room.,nan,1,ex1080
expedia,Only negative was that they would not allow me to earn my SPG points since I booked through hotels.com and the reception/check in staff on arrival was rude.,nan,1,ex1081
expedia,Pet friendly even with a great dane.,nan,1,ex1082

expedia,My son and I especially loved the city views from our room. A must see for anyone in from out of town!!,nan,1,ex1084
expedia,"The hotel itself is stunning, very luxurious. The rooms, however, are nothing special. I stayed in a double bed room. The bedding was fantastic and high quality, comfortable pillows. The bathroom was very dated and the shower did not drain properly. There also was no fan in the bathroom and it was rather warm getting ready after a shower in the morning. For the price of the room I would expect a lot more in the amenities and higher quality bath products.",nan,1,ex1085
expedia,Enjoyed my stay. The view was spectacular! The front desk was very helpful. The bed was comfy.,nan,1,ex1086
expedia,"Nice location. The room was nice and the service was great. The beds are usually better so we were surprised it was so uncomfortable. But overall there was nothing to complain about. The staff is what really makes this place great. They are always so nice. Also, I love that they are dog friendly. We stayed here once and they brought our dogs beds. Our fur babies loved it.",nan,1,ex1087
expedia,"I was totally amazed that there was no free internet access in our hotel room, only in the Lobby. For the price of the room it really should include free internet service. Very disappointed. Also the rooms were very load, I could hear the neighbor above and next to us talking and running water for shower.This was very annoying as guests were coming and going at all hours of the night.",nan,1,ex1088
expedia,"Nice property, in a great location. Poor housekeeping staff, and follow up by supervision caused repeated and persistent problems with our room cleaniliness, and maintenance. Would not recommend",nan,1,ex1089
expedia,"Frequent traveler but typically stay at other family of hotel chains. Decided to have a fling with Sheraton and in short, it's going to stay a one night stand. Received a lower configured room than (pre) paid for without an apology or adjustment to rate. Parking (self, not even valet) was the most expensive I've experienced in Chicago. Room was not exactly clean, and bathroom had mold in and around the tub.",nan,1,ex1090

expedia,"Great hotel,service was wonderfull,room view and location were perfect,the only feedback that I have is the room service food quality,not so good",nan,1,ex1094
expedia,I have stayed at the Sheraton because of the quality of service and the central location of the hotel close to attractions and fine dining.,nan,1,ex1095
expedia,"Just stayed two nights over the past weekend, but I received an upgrade to a room with a nicer view than I'd originally booked upon checking in. My experiences with the staff were uniformly excellent, and my room was very clean and well-appointed. Would stay again.",nan,1,ex1096
expedia,"Only stayed one night, but it was effortless and comfortable.",nan,1,ex1097

expedia,It was good.,nan,1,ex1099
expedia,"This was my first trip to Chicago and I picked the hotel based on the proximity to the river. The staff was very accommodating with a high floor facing the river.

expedia,"Hotel is close to shopping, the lake and museums.it was a lovely hotel.",nan,1,ex1101
expedia,Early arrival 8:30 staff on duty went out of their way to find a early room for me. Thanks to all.,nan,1,ex1102
expedia,"There are not many hotels within the walking distance from the Northwestern University. This hotel is one of them, so it can charge a high price without updating its interior. Many room doors are damaged and not repaired. Parking is not free ($14 per day) but the garage is not well-maintained. The payment is falling apart. The lighting is very bad. 7 out of 8 lamps on the top story are out! On the other hand, the lighting in the adjacent city's garage is even worse. I cannot believe when I saw a lady went into a dark city garage to pick up her car at night. Breakfast is included. The choices of food are reasonably good and healthy. In-room Wi-Fi is included and is pretty fast. The room is clean and quite comfortable. The hotel is close to transit and train tracks so the train noises come up periodically. The windows noise insulation is not good enough.",nan,1,ex1103
expedia,The experience was great . Family weekend getaway. Absolutely no problems..,nan,1,ex1104
expedia,"Take the train in and water taxi close to hotel (Michigan Ave). River front, night life, architechural river tour, or walk to Navy pier. Hotel is super clean with a friendly staff. I have stayed here several times with entire family and there there is not a room with a bad view. Might want to pay a little extra for the premium and get a lake and river view.",nan,1,ex1105
expedia,This hotel sits right along the river and has amazing views of Lake Michigan and the city. It's very close to the shopping on Michigan Ave as well as many restaurants. I would definitely not hesitate to stay here again in Chicago.,nan,1,ex1106
expedia,"If you stay in Chicago for downtown business or private, this hotel location is simply fantastic. Make sure to go for (or ask for) a riverside view room. The very(!) friendly and helpful staff at reception, gave me such ""upgrade"" to a riverside view room, and it made the stay at the hotel extra good with spectacularly view during night time. My highest recommendations to this hotel, staff and location (*****)",nan,1,ex1107
expedia,"We went to Chicago on a short family vacation. The Sheraton staff was very friendly and the check-in was super quick. The hotel is fantastic and neat and clean. The room was tidy and had everything we needed. A couple of things that could have made it a dream stay - they charged 18 dollars for one day of internet usage and the breakfast at the restaurant costed us like 80 dollars. When a family has young kids it is not always easy to take them to other options outside the hotel. Valet parking of course was expensive but that was expected in a big city like Chicago. Overall though, we enjoyed the stay.",nan,1,ex1108
expedia,"Good location, $700 per night does not cover breakfast, internet or even bottle of water...",nan,1,ex1109

expedia,"I stayed here overnight for an event downtown. Room was nice, clean, staff were efficient and polite. Nice view of river. I was rudely woken up by some loud rowdy guests who were slamming doors and banging on my door and trying to open my room. The shouting and slamming doors continued till 2 am. I could not get even a few hours of sleep especially after flying for 18 hours. It's not the hotel s fault.

expedia,"I can't say enough about how great the staff at the Sheraton Towers were when I treated my two 13-year-old granddaughters to their first ""girls only"" trip to Chicago. They squealed with joy as we pulled into the car port and were greeted by a wonderful, cheerful and knowledgeable valet. They squealed again as we rode the marble lined elevator to our room, and squealed yet again at the wonderful amenities - a spotless locker room with sauna and a great pool for swimming fun! The room was comfortable and also spotless. The only negative was the size of the bathroom, but there may be no bathroom large enough for two teenage girls and their grandmother! The hotel is close to Navy Pier (we could see the ferris wheel at night from our window) and Magnificent Mile shopping, both of which we thoroughly enjoyed. We would definitely stay here again on our next trip to Chicago.",nan,1,ex1112
expedia,nice clean hotel near Navy Pier. Beautiful view from room window of lake and river.,nan,1,ex1113
expedia,The hotel was very nice. When we booked the hotel I paid extra for a river view but once we checked in we were told there were no river views available and were assigned a room on the 14 floor with a view of the roof and the Navy Pier. I did request a higher floor so that we did not have to look at the roof and were taken care of right away. The view of the Navy Pier was nice but really wanted a river view. I think a confrence in town prevented us from getting what we reserved.,nan,1,ex1114
expedia,The hotel was clean and location was good. I have stayed in fancier hotels with better accommodations for half the price. The rooms were small. You couldn't even use the fridge because they have the mini bar stocked with their items. I would not stay here again for the price. Parking was overpriced just as the rooms were.,nan,1,ex1115
expedia,The Sheraton on the Chicago River was exactly what we were looking for. It was a very nice hotel. We wanted walking distance to Navy Pier and Millenium Park. It was very easy to get to both. The parking was very convenient as well. We actually had a nice view of the city and small view of the Chicago River and Lake Michigan from our room.,nan,1,ex1116
expedia,Good experience overall. Rooms are small for the price and could be a little cleaner. Location was great quality of service was good but had one person speak in a not so pleasant tone. I would stay there again. I am hard to please so that that into consideration when reading this.,nan,1,ex1117
expedia,"We had some issues with the first rooms cleanliness. But we brought it to their attention & they were very accommodating upgraded us to a different room which was very very satisfied. Restaurants were very expensive. But we walked two blocks over to a restaurant called ""West Egg"" food there was exceptional in very well priced. No hot tub so that was disappointing. The two gentl eman bartenders in ""Shulers"" was awesome. I ate dinner alone & I ate at the bar cause they made me feel welcome. Overall we loved the hotel and would definitely stay there again.",nan,1,ex1118
expedia,Ho trovato le lenzuola sporche e le persone alla reception non sono affatto gentili. Inoltre gli ascensori funzionano male e la connessione a internet (a pagamento) pessima,nan,1,ex1119

expedia,"I frequent this hotel every time I stay in Chicago. Usually, it's top of the line. This trip was a bit off. I walked into my room to see a loud floor fan on high setting, drying a damp floor. The room was very muggy. I was in kind of a quandary, do I leave the loud fan on & keep drying the floor or turn it off & make the room even muggier? That was really my only complaint about this stay.",nan,1,ex1121
expedia,Great hotel. Location was great. Beds were very comfortable. Rooms were clean and staff were very helpful and friendly. Would definitely stay there again.,nan,1,ex1122

I have stayed here several times & it never fails to make my trips so much more cost efficient & pleasant.",nan,1,ex1123
expedia,"We took a weekend trip to Chicago and have always heard great things about the Sheraton. Upon checking in the the valet was quick and friendly. Checking in was probably the best and welcoming check in I've encountered. I believe the woman's name at check in was Toni (I don't recall) but she allowed me to check in 30 min before 3, gave me free wifi, and allowed me 1pm late check out. The room itself was probably the biggest downside to my stay at the Sheriton. The hotel itself is beautiful especially the lobby but the rooms are outdated and not the cleanest. My experience with the concierge desk was fantastic both times I visited. The people behind the desk were knowledgable and provided discounts to attractions/restaurants. Upon checking out I went to the check in desk ensure that 1pm late check out was still fine. To my surprise the gentlemen behind the desk starting telling me that they really shouldn't be allowing late check outs because they needed to turnover the room for the next guests (very unprofessional in my opinion). The gentlemen insisted we check out before 1pm but since we were allowed late check out during our check in it would be okay.",nan,1,ex1124
expedia,We love this hotel - one of our top favorites.,nan,1,ex1125
expedia,"Loved the river side downtown location.The lobby , bar and common areas are new and attractive. Rooms are in need of a refresh. Furniture and bathroom showing signs of aging and decor a little dated.",nan,1,ex1126

expedia,Close to navy pier. Thee hotel lobby is very nice and the beds are great. shula's restaurant is very good. I would stay there again.,nan,1,ex1131
expedia,Liked the location. We had to wait over 30 min to get our car that had been valet parked. They had retrieved the wrong one,nan,1,ex1132
expedia,"The location & view were fantastic! The showers were outdated and very loud when used by neighbor. Lobby beautiful but rooms lacked upgrades. TV was small, towels 1st day were rough/cheap, 2nd day soft/good. Not interested in returning, not worth $",nan,1,ex1133
expedia,"I like a frig to put things in. Not all the expensive liquor and treats on the table that cost 11-15 per item. There were 2 missing spots of liquor bottles and some cherry tomatoes in there place. I informed staff I do not want to be chgd for the missing bottles of booze. Otherwise, the view was so awesome and beautiful. Hard to find hotel on gps. too many interferences. It is right by trump. Very nice bell service. But they charge for everything.",nan,1,ex1134
expedia,"When I checked in, the room key did not work. I was let in the room by a bellman with the plan that someone would come up to the room with a new key. That did not happen. I made several trips down to get new keys with no success. Ultimately moved to a new room after many new sets of keys and resetting if the lock once and then again as we moved. Received free breakfast but that did not make up for the hours that were spent messing around with getting new keys, probably 3 hours at least.",nan,1,ex1135
expedia,"The beds and pillows were ridiculously comfortable! Service was nice and parking was easy as well. It was a little noisy being next to the lake and staying on the weekend, there was some rowdy adults that had to be talked to due to their language and noise level. I will stay there again!!!",nan,1,ex1136

expedia,"Loved the comfort of the room, the beds are comfortable as well. Hotel is a hotel with great service and stunning views! We have spent 4 nights in this hotel, 3 nights in a row and at the end of the holiday another night in a different room on a different floor. All 4 nights were broken nights due to loud, partying, sometimes obviously drunk people. Not once, but many times per night. Which did not give a restful sleep to us of course.",nan,1,ex1141
expedia,"Found what I thought was a great hotel for a great price in a great location. Turned out to be a great dissapointment!! We were excited about our stay when we drove up to the hotel. The outside was very eye appealing. When we walked in to the lobby, everything looked very high class!! The guy however at the reception desk acted like we were interrupting his plans when we checked in...ok, I get it. I'll let it pass...it was 12am when we checked in, and people are allowed to have bad days. We admired the lobby as we walked to the elevator. When we reached our floor, it was like we stepped off a time machine to 1987!! The hallway was dark and out dated. The doors looked to be painted by my grandma and about 6 costs too thick. The room wasn't any better. The only up to date thing about the room was the tv. The view was decent, but for the price this was not worth it. When you get a ""deal"" on a expensive hotel, you expect to feel like you're stealing the room for the weekend. Not so in this case. In fact I felt like the hotel was stealing from me!! This was horrible and caused me to cut my vacation short. Was not worth staying 2 nights. I've stayed in a lot of hotels in this area, and this has to be hands down the worst stay I've had. Don't let the picture fool you!",nan,1,ex1142
expedia,"Very nice hotel, 2nd time staying here. Front desk is really nice.",nan,1,ex1143
expedia,"Hotel is in a great location. Convenient to Million Dollar Mile, good restaurants, and all of Chicago's transportation. What makes this hotel exceptional is the staff. Everyone was exceedingly friendly and focused on our experience. They offered suggestions for things to do, asked how they could accommodate any requests. As an example, the weather was rainy and we did not have an umbrella. As we were leaving the employee in the lobby stopped us and offered to us a hotel umbrella, we did not even need to ask. Every requests was met with a friendly 'yes'.",nan,1,ex1144

Any questions or concerns we had were addressed immediately and resolved. The rooms are nice and clean. The bed was very comfortable. I loved the location of this hotel! The only negative I have about the hotel is the noise. You can hear people in the hallway very easily which is a problem at 2 AM.",nan,1,ex1147
expedia,"This trendy hotel has it all: excellent location, perfect size, casual elegance, great bar & restaurant (food's pricey but delicious); friendly, helpful, professional staff; spotless rooms with good amenities, very comfy beds, hip decor, fast elevators.

expedia,"Very comfortable relaxing hotel,spent all day pounding the streets around the various attracting, shops and bars, then back to the hotel for a cocktail before refreshing and starting the evening entertainment! All the staff were very friendly and more than helpful with any of my needs. I totally recommend anyone staying here from the young partygoers (within short walking distances of great bars and clubs) to the older more refined within a short stroll to find a lovely restaurant or cocktail bar ( both of these you'll find within the hotel).",nan,1,ex1154
expedia,Happy from beginning to end. All staff was very friendly. Room was immaculate. A lot of attention to details. Wonderful gym. Pleased with late check out time of 2:00. Very conveniently located to restaraunts and shopping. Would stay here again.,nan,1,ex1155

expedia,"This is the only hotel I stay in when I travel to Chicago. Great staff, very friendly and accommodating. The bed is very comfy and bathroom products are amazing! DB Primehouse is my favorite steak house; however the hotel bar and Jimmy next door are dead. The location is central and close to all...you won't be disappointed!",nan,1,ex1157
expedia,We were greeted at the door of the James immediately upon our arrival by cab from the airport. The staff here were literally the first Chicagoans we met on our first time in the city and it set the tone for a fantastic Chicago experience!,nan,1,ex1158
expedia,"I paid for the ""upgrade"" (nominal) that put us on the 14th floor with a view. It was very clean, very quiet, and the staff was at all times pleasant, helpful and professional. I have stayed in several other hotels in Chicago and this is a wonderfully convenient location just off Michigan Ave. The beds are made up with white sheeting over the comforter..none of those mysterious (ick) patterned spreads/comforters here. It was very crisp and clean. There are newspapers and coffee in the lobby and a bar and restaurant on site but plenty of options right out of the door as well. I also appreciated the original fine art and there is a business area (if needed) with computers and desks. Absolutely no complaints!",nan,1,ex1159

From the moment we drove upper and had the car valet parked, to the moment we left, every staff member was awesome! They really understand customer service at this hotel, which is something some companies just seem to have forgotten these days. Great room with plenty of space. We have decided to always stay here from now on while in Chicago. Stay here...you too will love it and feel welcomed!",nan,1,ex1161
expedia,"I stayed here for 2 nights. The room was clean and organized. The Smart TV in the room would have been great if it didn't lag so much. On one of the nights we ordered fries and a beer through room service. We specifically asked for hot sauce, no ketchup. We were told the wait would be about 40 minutes. About 45 minutes later, we got a cold, stale order of fries with no hot sauce and a bottle of ketchup. The beer came in a glass with plastic wrap covering the lid. The price for the 2 items was $22.

expedia,"Check in starts at 2, and we arrived a little after 4pm to find out that our room wasn't ready yet. We were told it would be about 20 - 30 min and were given a drink coupon to enjoy 2 cocktails (from a list 5 drinks long) in the bar during that time. An hour later we still didn't have a room. The hotel staff said they would upgrade us in light of this which prompted my husband to ask if the bed size would still be the same (we had booked a king bed). We were assured that it would be but that was not the case once we got in the room. We had a queen size bed and the thermostat wasn't working properly (the room never went below 74 degrees). Considering it was nearly 6 pm by this point, we just decided to suck it up and take the room. The only reason I booked this hotel was because of all of the rave reviews but our experience was certainly not up to par. Plenty of other (and better!) hotels in Chicago.",nan,1,ex1171
expedia,"Interesting Hotel! Comfortable bed and pillows, nice TV and within walking distance to nice restaurants. A bonus at the front desk, was the coffee in the morning and the hot cider in the evening! Car parking was pricey, but have nothing in area to compare it to",nan,1,ex1172

expedia,"This hotel is very conveniently located. It is nicely decorated. The rooms are nicely arranged. The appearances are 4-star. The service and functionality were extremely disappointing. Due to allergies, we requested in advance that the bedding be changed out. It was not upon arrival. We requested this again. No one arrived to service the room for 4 hours. We requested the service a 3rd time. Our toilet clogged after that. Maintenance took 30 min to arrive. ""Fixed it"" but did not clean up the water from the floor. And, it actually was not fixed, so we spent the night with an unusable toilet. When we alerted the desk to this at check-out, the response was ""Do you want us to leave the $26 bar bill on your card?"" There are many places to stay that are as nice and more attentive to basic services.",nan,1,ex1174

The room was very quiet, nicely appointed, and was decorated with newly designed furnishings The mini bar was one of the best ""in room"" bars that I've seen. There were two robes in the room plus spa quality shower amenities. The bed was very comfortable and there were multiple pillow options to chose from. All of this coupled with the unbeatable location made this a destination to return to.",nan,1,ex1179

We stayed in the king deluxe and I didn't like that there was only one drawer in the mini bar for both of us to put our clothes. I also did not like the small bathroom, with no vanity space for two. There was not any where to sit to dry my hair. Also the closet was too small.",nan,1,ex1180

expedia,Hotel was nice. Staff was great. Location amazing. Was more than happy w stay,nan,1,ex1184
expedia,"Couldn't have been more pleased with the James. First things first, the hotel's location is hard to beat. Just a block from Michigan Avenue and walking distance to so many good shops and restaurants. all of the hotel staff from the doorman, the courtesy car driver, the concierge, the front desk personnel, maintenance and housekeeping were amazing friendly, professional and accommodating. I think they went above and beyond what i have experienced in most other hotel properties and they should be commended. The room was the ""loft"" room and it was outstanding. Very spacious and while it's not super clear from the website the room has a bedroom and living area with a couch and a media room with another queen sized lounging area that is essentially another very comfortable bed that they will make up as a bed for you upon request. This was great for traveling with children although keep in mind that there are no doors to either ""room"" so there is no true privacy. also there is no lock on the bathroom door; which i hate. i don't get this trend. but that was my only nitpick with the room itself. I will definitely be staying at The James on my next visit to Chicago! Can't recommend it enough",nan,1,ex1185

expedia,"Quick weekend getaway, really impressed. Big hotel service and amenities with boutique hotel feel. Location is literally unbeatable. Get an interior suite and was comfortable with the tradeoff between a city view and the spacious room. Nice in-room bar selection, and appreciated the coffee in the lobby each morning. Carafe of water was also a nice touch, but having TJ's across the street for bottled spring water and other misc. small items is perfect. Wonderful stay and a very good value.",nan,1,ex1188

expedia,"Front desk should be better be familiar with the local restaurants/attractions. I inquired about the House of Blues for dinner and entertainment and the concierge thought she was being helpful by reserving us a table in the foundation room. I was surprised that we needed to make reservations (which should have been the first clue) but the front desk insisted this was the best thing to do. Turns out we were booked in the members only section, where they publicize their support of debauchery on the website....... We were not given the choice to confirm our preference - local or private. The second incident - i inquired about a restaurant called McArthurs (that should have been the first clue that i had no clue where i was going) we were simply interested based on an article in one of the magazines in the hotel room where the author cited it for having outstanding ""soul food"". We came to find out the neighborhood was not a good one, in fact trying to get a cab to pick us up proved to be a challenge (since there were no cabbies willing to take the chance of entering the neighborhood). I would have expected some form of insight from the front desk. Other than that, the hotel itself was very nice and the neighborhood is good. I would return and would recommend with a word of caution with respect to the front desk staff.",nan,1,ex1194

expedia,What a great hotel! My husband stays here when he is in town for work but it was also great for our family when we tagged along on one of his trips. It is trendy but practical. We had a loft room which was plenty of room for us and our toddler. I requested a quiet room so that our toddler who goes to bed at 730pm would not be woken up and they accomadated us. The David Burke restaurant in the hotel is amazing. We had dinner one night and even though its prices are regular for steakhouses they were more then welcoming to our toddler. They have an impressive kids menu that our son loved! All of the staff was so helpful-especially belldesk and guys at the front door. You are really close to all the great restaurants and shops.

Check-in was pleasant and efficient and valet parking was convenient. There's not much to the lobby bar, so we opted to have drinks elsewhere. We were on the 7th floor, street view. A stay on a higher floor would have afforded us a better city view. The bed was comfortable, and the shower was hot and strong. We liked the organic minty shampoo and body wash in the shower. Bathroom was otherwise small. The room was modern and well appointed. Our only complaint was the hairdryer. I didn't bring my own and the one provided got hot but barely blew air and it took a long time to dry my hair. The staff was professional and courteous.

expedia,The location was great and the staff was really helpful. We got there early and they actually called my cell phone when the room was ready. The concierge had great suggestions on what to do and where to go.,nan,1,ex1216
expedia,"Great Location, Great Service, Comfortable bed. There was more street noise that I expected. I felt gauged at being charged $60 per night for parking. The room was decorated ultra modern.",nan,1,ex1217
expedia,"Would not consider this hotel anything higher than a 4 star, everyone was very nice but the amenities were limited.",nan,1,ex1218
expedia,"The James Hotel is in a great location with outstanding service. They are surrounded by notable restaurants: Eataly, David Burke Steakhouse and a Shake Shack opening very soon.",nan,1,ex1219
expedia,Simply amazing,nan,1,ex1220
expedia,The staff and door men at The James were super friendly and helpful. The hotel was so conveniently located that we walked everywhere. The rooms were clean and well stocked. We are already talking about staying there when we go back for Christmas,nan,1,ex1221

expedia,"Since they greet you at the front, everybody is so friendly and nice. They try to make you feel very comfortable. I deffinetely recommend the hotel and the location too!",nan,1,ex1226
expedia,"The people make the trip, and the people who work here are top notch, especially Jamie at the door and Stacie in the restaurant. Also, don't stay here if you don't plan on eating at the Primehouse--it's delicious!",nan,1,ex1227
expedia,"This was a lovely boutique hotel. The property was clean, fresh and updated. It was close to everything we wanted to do and had a wonderful restaurant. I would certainly stay here again while visiting Chicago.",nan,1,ex1228
expedia,"I spent 4 days/nights in Chicago for my birthday and stayed at the James Hotel. When I arrived, the front desk was extremely friendly, helpful and welcoming. The lobby was buzzing with action. Being situated with the #1 rated steakhouse in Chicago doesn't hurt either. The room was suite and relatively spacious. The doormen were all very friendly and courteous. The thing that I liked the most was the location. The hotel is situated very close to several first rate restaurants and the Magnificient Mile which is great for shoppers.",nan,1,ex1229
expedia,"Amazing hotel with wonderful staff and service. Would stay again. Only complaint would be the amount of alcohol in the room. Although I realize not a problem for many/ as non-drinkers, it seemed excessive. When asked to have alcohol removed, we were told of a $75 charge to do so. We opted not to have it removed- but an ""alcohol free"" option of rooms for non/drinker might be nice.",nan,1,ex1230
expedia,"We had an excellent stay at the James. We arrived on a Friday morning at 9:30am thinking that we would drop off our bags and head out for the day since checkin isn't until 2pm. We were pleasantly surprised to see that our rooms were ready, and my travel companion who booked a separate room was upgraded to a studio free of charge. The James is perfectly located in the heart of the Mag Mile area and is a short walk to all the great shops and restaurants in the area. I would definitely stay at the James again.",nan,1,ex1231
expedia,"The hotel is in a great location, the staff was very helpful and polite.",nan,1,ex1232

expedia,I just stayed for 1 night on business. Large room with a sittiing area and a wet bar. There is a bar and a good steak house on site. I plan to stay at The James again next time I'm in Chicago for work or pleasure,nan,1,ex1237
expedia,"The hotel is situated in one of the best downtown neighbourhoods, if not the best. Just off the Magnificent Mile, the hotel also features a renowned steak house, rated #1 in Chicago. The hotel was a pleasant experience to return to after a day of enjoying the wonderful city of Chicago.",nan,1,ex1238
expedia,"I had a very positive experience at The James Hotel. The staff member that greeted me was very helpful and hospitable. We sought the advice of the Concierge an hour later and had the same experience. She provided us with some simple must sees as our trip was short and it was my first time visiting Chicago. The room was spacious, clean, well planned out. We will definitely stay there again.",nan,1,ex1239

Will return for sure, try a me at the purple pig you will not regret it!!! Take a stroll with a horse abs buggy, what a charm!!! Plan to stay for a week you will not regret it!!!!",nan,1,ex1241
expedia,And a great location.,nan,1,ex1242
expedia,Staff was nice. Rooms were small. We stayed during the week day. You could hear all the noises from out side. We have stayed at other hotels that were nearby. And did not have that problem at all. It reminded us of a over prices motel6. Will never come back again,nan,1,ex1243
expedia,"Terrific hotel, great location. Rooms are unique, especially the King Loft, as the loft ara is a very cool hang-out bed with a projector and audio/visual, but unfortunately NO TV hook-up in the loft. So watching a game or such requires the uncomfortable sofa, but still a great stay.",nan,1,ex1244
expedia,"Great mini bar and mini frig in the room with drinks and snacks. Very comfortable lighting, nice size room, staff are excellent. Location is convenient to the art museum, restaurants.",nan,1,ex1245

expedia,We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at The James. The room was beautiful (we were upgraded as it was my birthday) and all staff were friendly and helpful. Bar and restaurant were also very good. The hotel is centrally placed just off the Magnificent Mile.,nan,1,ex1247
expedia,This is by far the best hotel I have stayed at in Chicago. The room was very clean. The staff was very friendly. Plus the location was great.,nan,1,ex1248
expedia,Close to everything. Loved the art in the hotel. The staff that handled the room service was a bit rude but the rest of the experience was good. Clean rooms in a pretty cool hotel.,nan,1,ex1249
expedia,Excellent base for doing business in the windy city. Room very comfortable and easy to work out of. Location is ideal for restaurants and safe for walking around in the evening.,nan,1,ex1250
expedia,This is our fourth stay at the James in as many years. We drive from Texas to visit family and friends. The location is great and we can easily walk to major attractions and restaurants. The staff is so helpful and friendly. We reported two minor problems in our room and they were literally fixed within 10 minutes of our request. We used the work out facility and enjoyed the treadmill. We wouldn't think of staying anywhere else and look forward to our summer trip to Chicago.,nan,1,ex1251
expedia,Beautiful hotel and very close to shopping and subway.,nan,1,ex1252
expedia,The James Hotel was perfectly located in Chicago with shops restaurants and all amenities minutes from the door of the hotel. The room was spacious and bed was so comfortable . The staff were extremely helpful and friendly.,nan,1,ex1253
expedia,Wonderful stay at a wonderful hotel located near everything you could possibly want to do.,nan,1,ex1254
expedia,They do not have a microwave and the fridge is full with their booze.,nan,1,ex1255
expedia,"The staff was extremely kind and helpful overall. But we ordered room service and the food was horrible and overpriced. We ordered a cheeseburger/fries and a grilled cheese/fries and a Caesar salad. The burger was very greasy and the meat quality was poor. We only had one bite of the salad (it was the worst caesar salad we have ever had). The grilled cheese was cold and the cheese itself was chunky and oily. With tip the bill was $67. The beds were extremely small and very uncomfortable. The room did have a refrigerator but it was filled with mini bar items so we were unable to put our items in it. For the price of the room, there should have been a microwave. The bathroom sink's water never got hot. The shower was exceptionally nice though and had great pressure. It was disappointing that the hotel only had one town car available for use, especially since the policy was no reservations ahead of time and you couldn't request a pick up from a specific destination. We were there for a concert at Soldier Field and basically because of the hotel policy it made it impossible to even consider using the hotel car; because plans needed to be made ahead of time. So when the concert was over, my daughter and I walked for over an hour before we were able to get a taxi. The hotel should have been more accommodating to guests in this instance. The hotel itself was beautiful and clean and in a great location. The staff was friendly also. But overall I would not recommend this hotel and would not stay here again. For the price, the extra amenities you would expect, were just not available. If you wanted to swim you had to go across the street to another hotel. Not very practical with a five month old and a six year old. Also, for the room price and what you actually received, an additional $60 a day for parking seemed excessive. The next time we stay in downtown Chicago we will be trying a new hotel.We were disappointed with our stay.",nan,1,ex1256
expedia,"Great hotel! You are in the center of everything, and it is a great place to stay for both business and travel. We will definitely stay there again next time I am in Chicago!",nan,1,ex1257
expedia,As New Yorkers we love the NYC James but we were disappointed here...The location is good for all the City Center sites but the hotel itself was disappointing. We were hoping for a slice of luxury hotel feel for a weekend away but the minimal decor starts to feel more budget hotel than modern and cool once it gets scruffy and worn at the edges. The room was small and bland rather than minimal. Two broken items in our room and a random wet patch on the carpet appeared midway through our stay! Two tiny lifts were overwhelmed by holiday weekend traffic and unfortunately lower down rooms seem to suffer with traffic noise (not surprising but good to know in advance). With no pool or lobby bar the place missed having atmosphere in our opinion. On a positive the staff were mostly helpful and the cocktails at the Jimmy are amazing!,nan,1,ex1258
expedia,"The hotel is very nice, clean rooms, friendly staff and perfect location.",nan,1,ex1259
expedia,"The James is located perfectly for shopping and dining anywhere downtown. The staff went out of their way to be of any assistance we needed. We had a ""loft"" suite which couldn't have been more comfortable. We will definitely stay here next time in the Windy City.",nan,1,ex1260
expedia,"The James is well located, clean, has wonderful service (great concierge), many amenities (gym, spa, free wi-fi, access to computers in lobby) and a wonderful restaurant and bar. I give them an A+ in the factors they control! My criticism is that the surrounding neighborhood is VERY loud. From bedtime to early morning I heard non-stop sirens, tons of loud car stereos, banging garbage trucks and beeping delivery trucks. If you are a heavy sleeper you may do fine but I did not get a full night's sleep during my four night stay. We were on the 9th floor...maybe it was a lot better higher up...ask for the highest floor you can get but beware the elevators are limited in size and frequency. This is common in the many well-renovated hotels in this part of town. The great news about the neighborhood is you are close to the CTA, the train and tons of restaurant options running the gamut of price and quality. I love that the hotel was near Trader Joe's, Starbucks and a wonderful Jewel Osco store. I would stay again but would request a higher floor and maybe take some ear plugs.",nan,1,ex1261
expedia,"The James was outstanding. 1st class hotel in a great area. Not the largest rooms, but updated nicely. And the service here is fantastic. Not one complaint on our side.",nan,1,ex1262
expedia,"We secured the James Hotel through an Expedia package a few months out at a good price. When we arrived several hours before check-in the room was ready. The concierge was very helpful with tickets to tours and shows as well as restaurant recommendations and transport directions. One morning we were able to take advantage of the courtesy car for a ride to meet a tour guide. When rain was threatening, complimentary umbrellas were available. Even the coffee served in the lobby each morning was quite good. On the day we checked out the hotel kept our bags all day until 7 pm while we enjoyed the full day in town before heading to O Hare. Don't hesitate to book the James for a stay in the River North area of Chicago!",nan,1,ex1263
expedia,Air conditioner too loud. The room is not cleaned up even though we don't put the don't disturb sign.,nan,1,ex1264

expedia,"Although the room was not what I expected it to be (more updated)according to the pictures, I was not totally dissatisfied because it was very neat and clean. The bed was very comfortable. Probably the most comfortable that I have experienced with any hotel. The staff was very polite and helpful. I also enjoyed having concierge available for questions about the city. I was allowed to check in early because a room was available. There was also a room to keep luggage if you arrived early and the room wasn't ready, or in my case waiting for my flight to leave. It is also conveniently located in the heart of the city within walking distance of a lot of attractions.These were some of the things that made my stay here worthwhile and receive my recommendation for booking.",nan,1,ex1271
expedia,"Comfy, clean and very helpful staff. Hotel is situated within walking distance of everything and the taxi service is very prompt at the hotel. The beds are comfy and the only thing I didn't like is the instant coffee in the room with a kettle. The lobby has complimentary morning coffee, which is very good. Although I dont prefer to dress and leave my room to get my morning coffee. Other than that, I highly recommend the James. I would definitely stay again.",nan,1,ex1272

expedia,"1 - I paid for a river-view suite- did not get it - 2 - I paid for a suite to comfortably accommodate two adults & two children. One dresser (aka TV stand) had only two drawers & a broken shelf that was available for clothes. Only a few hangers were available in the closet too. IN THE KING SIZE BED AREA: 3 - I had to request bedding for this bed. I requested pillows, sheets & comforter. They gave me two flat sheets (instead of one & one fitted sheet) & I had to make/fix the bed myself. Never received fitted sheet entire stay. 4 - I had to request a lamp due to no light(s). They gave me a bent/broken lamp that needed the wall to stay up/still. 5 - The overhead projector continuously broke down & had continuous scratching sounds throughout DVD playing. IN THE MAIN SITTING ARA: 6 - The TV sound had to be set at level 100 to hear it over the air-conditioner. Then, the TV sound had to be set at level 50 (or higher) to be heard - normally. IN THE QUEEN SIZE BED AREA: 7 - The TV sound had to be set at level 100 to hear it over the air-conditioner.

The entire staff was incredibly, providing prompt service when needed and excellent recommendations on the surrounding area. The James is close enough to all the downtown Chicago attractions while being away from some of the Michigan Avenue traffic. Our room was very well appointed and comfortable, with lots of small unexpected amenities like free WiFi and free water that made our stay even nicer. I would definitely stay at The James my next time in Chicago.",nan,1,ex1279

The location is fantastic if you want to walk to all of the downtown attractions from the Hancock Tower down to Millenium park. The L is close at hand for further trips. The Ribhouse is world class and the servers were superior. This is a great deal for an excellent value!!!",nan,1,ex1282

My wife and I were both impressed by the professionalism of each and every member of the staff that we interacted with during our five-day stay.

The James is our new personal favorite for Chicago, and we hope to stay there every time we visit the city.",nan,1,ex1287
expedia,"I thought the hotel was very accomodating in terms of friendliness of staff, cleanliness of the lobby and the hotel rooms and the location.

Elegant rooms with plenty of space to work and relax. The only downside was having to call room service to get ice delivered since they don't have public ice machines. Other than that, our stay was fantastic--a few blocks from Michigan Ave. and near many restaurants. A few blocks from the Red Line and a short 15-minute walk from the Blue Line, which was handy since we came in/out of O'Hare. Will definitely try to get a room there next time I'm in Chicago!",nan,1,ex1292

expedia,"The hotel staff was extremely helpful, patient and accomodating. We were a difficult, high maintenance group of 3 adults and 3 teenagers.

I would love to return again.",nan,1,ex1297

Each and every staff member, from those on the front desk to those greeting & hailing cabs to those working in the spa, made us feel welcome and at home.

I had a package arrived the hotel ahead of me and the concierge, Laurelin helped receiving and storing it in advance. There were few emails back-and-forth with immediate feedback. And the package was delivered to me upon my arrival which did me a great favour. The staff delivered more than I expected which made my stay much more delightful.",nan,1,ex1299

A lounge area in our room that had a projector TV with surround sound, a sitting area with another flat screen, and a very comfortable bed....of course with yet another flat screen! The rooms were very quiet. It's located in a very desirable area of downtown. The dinner was phenomenal! A must!",nan,1,ex1308
expedia,A friend and I decided to book at The James hotel last minute at the 4th of July because everywhere else seemed to be booked. The moment we asked for help at the valet was a red flag and should have known better to stay with this hotel. The valet was very rude and unwelcoming as we were just trying to find other alternatives to park besides valet because we have had a bad experience in the past with valet services. The pretty much set the mood for the entire evening as we only stayed for one night. The double queen room we was very loud and uncomfortable as were trying to get a quiet nights rest. It was pretty obnoxious with all the police sirens and ambulances and overall noise from the streets as we could hear EVERYTHING. I would not recommend this hotel at all. The $250 plus $50 parking was not worth it period. Would have rather stayed somewhere else and paid for a much cheaper room not in the city had we known that it was going to be an experience like this.,nan,1,ex1309

The rooms were great size, well appointed, luxurious, the beds were so confotable, the lighting was abundant and great! We were on the 11th floor and had a decent view of some of the surrounding residential buildings. The concierge was so helpful and got us a table at David Burke's in about 15 minutes (one of the best steakhouses in the city is right in the hotel). The staff was so friendly, the hotel as a whole was very quiet, aside from street no use. Even though it was one of the busiest weekends for the hotel, it never seemed crowded, too loud, or anything negative. The location is PERFECTION as it's one block off Michigan so it's a less crowded street, but its walking distance to everything, including Navy Pier. I truly cannot express how satisfied we were with The James. You absolutely can't go wrong here!",nan,1,ex1318

The staff was incredibly helpful and even called the Shedd Aquarium for us to see if they would hold our luggage (FYI: they actually have lockers that fit carry on rolling suitcases for only $1!). I will definitely stay here again.,nan,1,ex1323

expedia,"I had a very pleasant stay at this Hotel in June. The Hotel has a friendly, cozy athmosphere and I was very welcome everytime I went in or out. Felt like I was taken care of, and never overseen. Very nice staff both at reception and by the front door. Very personal service. I enjoyed a lot their complintary morning coffee. The gym is very well equipped and clean. The location is perfect, right on the Magnificent Mile with it's shopping divine and only 1 km to the nearest beach and lake shore. I will definitely come back.",nan,1,ex1327
expedia,"Staff was friendly, courteous. Clean, ""hip"" rooms. Loved the daily flavored water in the lobby!",nan,1,ex1328

expedia,"After staying at a conference hotel down the street for three nights, I switched to The James Hotel in order to stay over the weekend and see more of Chicago than the inside of a conference room. The James Hotel was just the change that I needed. Not only was my room at The James much less expensive than my original hotel, the room was also much, much larger! My husband and I stayed in a Studio Suite which included a separate living area and a massive bathroom. The room had a very zen like quality which was a great retreat from the hustle and bustle of the city. Speaking of the city, The James Hotel is also in the most perfect location. Just a block off of Michigan Avenue - which makes it close to all of the attractions and shopping that Chicago has to offer. We also took in a Cubs game while in town, and the red line was only a two block walk from the hotel. I would definitely recommend this hotel and stay again upon my next trip to Chicago!",nan,1,ex1331
expedia,Our original room face towards the quiet inside atrium but we were promptly switched after asking for something with a city view. Very friendly and helpful staff,nan,1,ex1332

expedia,"Great service all around, close to restaurants and shops.",nan,1,ex1334
expedia,"Amazing location, super accommodating staff , luxurious amenities ... Highly recommend!",nan,1,ex1335
expedia,We weren't at the room very much as we were out sightseeing most of the time. This hotel is conveniently located a block from Michigan Ave (Magnificent Mile) and walking distance to many sites like the John Hancock building. It is also a few blocks from the red line train which made it simple to get around. They also offer a complimentary car service when available. Overall our stay was good. Cons- the hotel front desk person didn't know much about the area when we asked for a good burger place to watch a hockey game. He said he could look up reviews for us- well I can do that too! Thanks! I could also hear through the walls a bit but it was overall a quiet hotel (not a ton of partying nearby).,nan,1,ex1336
expedia,"Not your standard type hotel, a bit contemporary but nice. Staff were friendly.",nan,1,ex1337
expedia,Room was incredibly large and very comfortable. Towels and robes some of the best I've seen anywhere. Tons of amenities. Great concierge service. Would stay again.,nan,1,ex1338
expedia,"This hotel was in the perfect location, you could walk essentially anywhere downtown. From the amazingly comfortable bed, free water/coffee/wi-fi and gracious staff I would highly recommend this hotel. Being health conscious, I especially appreciated the toxin free bath products. I highly recommend and will be back!",nan,1,ex1339
expedia,"Shopping, the lake, Naval Pier, Museums - all within walking distance from this great hotel. The hotel is modern, bedding was a dream for a restful night after all the walking. The staff was fantastic, professional, friendly and so courteous! The room was very clean, emphasized by the white decor, and attractive interior design. Thank you Hotels.com for helping me find this great place in the middle of the best part of Chicago!",nan,1,ex1340
expedia,We had a really great stay. The area is perfect; just one block from the action and yet that one block means that it makes for a peaceful sleep in a funky hotel surrounded by great restaurants. The only improvement The James could make is in getting some more bikes so be sure to reserve one if you are looking to cycle.,nan,1,ex1341
expedia,"Really great location. Actual artwork on the walls! Very pleasant, great staff.",nan,1,ex1342
expedia,"Great location, good price, great bar, great minimalist style! I would definitely stay here again.",nan,1,ex1343
expedia,"When you're tired of the giant hyilton chains and their sad, thoughtless design. When you hate to pay good money for a room and then 12 bucks more for wifi. When you hate having to move the furniture to get to the power outlets. When you like a good looking bar, with a good looking crowd. - The James.",nan,1,ex1344
expedia,One block off the middle of the Magnificent Mile.,nan,1,ex1345
expedia,"A lovely comfy and spacious room with everything I needed. As a Brit, I was delighted to see a kettle! I had a guest room with a king size bed which was the best bed I've ever slept in. There was a bath, but it was very shallow (I guess they intended guests to mainly use the shower). That was the only thing that did not quite match the luxury and comfort of the rest of the hotel. The restaurant was expensive, but very very good, especially if you love steak. I didn't get around to using the spa or the gym as there's simply too much to do in four days in downtown Chicago.",nan,1,ex1346
expedia,Hotel staff were excellent. Made us feel very welcome.,nan,1,ex1347

expedia,"The hotel is in a perfect location as it is situated centrally to everything I wanted/needed to do. The staff was very friendly and professional. While the room wasn't set up exactly how I would have liked, it had everything I needed. It was clean and I also liked the emphasis on environment and natural products. The gym was fantastic and the restaurant/bar was better than average. Overall, I liked the stay and would stay here again.",nan,1,ex1349
expedia,"Great hotel, optimal location, awesome room. Very professional staff",nan,1,ex1350
expedia,"Checkin was flawless, my 2yo received the kids welcome pack. Free filtered water in the hotel room. We stayed in the loft, beautiful. Daughter watched the big screen and thoroughly enjoyed the whole experience. Bed was comfortable. Next time we will request a view of the street, as our view was looking inside the hotel walls. Great location for families, with so many restaurants and Trader Joe's across the road. Very close to Magnificent Mile, at a fraction of the cost of a hotel right on the Mile.",nan,1,ex1351
expedia,"The James is a great hotel with helpful, professional staff. The location is wonderful...close to the Magnificent Mile and a wide variety of restaurants. Major attractions were within walking distance of the hotel. Bikes were also available in the lobby free of charge. We enjoyed our week at the hotel.",nan,1,ex1352
expedia,"Hotel is well situated just off Michigan Ave. Convenient to the Red Line for Cubs or Sox games. The room was very clean. The furniture--chairs and sofa were extremely uncomfortable. There was a great deal of trouble with the electronic door lock to our room. Multiple sets of keys did not work. The engineer eventually replaced the door lock. Hotel staff was very courteous. We go to Chicago frequently, but will most likely not stay at the James again.",nan,1,ex1353

expedia,Great location. Very comfortable. Staff extremely helpful. A great stay.,nan,1,ex1357
expedia,Loved it all around.,nan,1,ex1358
expedia,Hotel was convenient and very comfortable. Great beds and pillows. Only problem was they pick up trash at 11:00pm and it lasted about 1/2 hour. Very noisy and hard to sleep until it was over. Breakfast was great and the service was helpful.,nan,1,ex1359
expedia,"The hotel does it up right. Great service, great food and a stones throw from the shops.",nan,1,ex1360
expedia,Very very nice staff especially Sammy at the front door. Rooms run down with tattered carpet and the most incredibly uncomfortable sofa bed that must have been a hold over from a medieval torture dungeon. Overworked hotel maid apologized in late afternoon as she had not been able to service our room. Loud street noise funnels up through the tall buildings right into your good nights sleep.,nan,1,ex1361
expedia,"Loved the suite -- though the fold-out couch wasn't comfortable for those who ended up having to sleep there. our king suite really slept three not four. Good space for a family as the ""bedroom"" provides quiet and privacy. We were very disappointed that the pool was down for maintenance -- that was something we were looking forward to. Breakfast was better than expected. Definitely recommend for Chicago travelers on a budget. Highly recommend you don't plan to park a car here.",nan,1,ex1362
expedia,The hotel is older but that is the charm in visiting Chicago. Staff were great. The full breakfast was a treat to have each morning and a $$ saver as well. The only bad thing was the valet parking cost...$55 per day. Next time I would park my own car and walk to the hotel,nan,1,ex1363
expedia,"This is an older property, but it's a great hotel. It's a great River North location, the rooms are large with plenty of space, and the free daily breakfast is a great convenience--as is the free wi-fi. The gym is adequate with two treadmills, an elliptical machine and weights. I'd definitely stay here again.",nan,1,ex1364
expedia,Loved it! Breakfast was tasty. Pool was very nice. My view was awesome. We loved the stay. The hotel was near everything very convenient.,nan,1,ex1365
expedia,"Got 2 rooms changed. The smoking room was not a good experience. We were told they would air it out, but don't think that happened. We were very disappointed that we couldn't get 3 rooms changed. When booking the rooms, it asked for special requests. As I was handicapped for the past 3 yrs. I never dreamed in this day and age that non-smoking would be a special request. My mistake.",nan,1,ex1366
expedia,"Everything about facility was wonderful! Only negative was the 2 front desk clerks we encountered were not very friendly, we felt like we were bothering them. The parking valets were great & accommodating!",nan,1,ex1367
expedia,decent stay with good value (free breakfast buffet and indoor pool); close to Magnificent Mile and great number of restuarants,nan,1,ex1368
expedia,We took our grandsons to Chicago for a spring break trip. The hotel was perfect for our needs. The suite provided a complete kitchen and the 2 rooms were separated by doors. A very good hot buffet breakfast was provided on china with silverward. You can even get a free dinner Monday-Thursday.,nan,1,ex1369
expedia,"The pictures make this hotel look like a very nice hotel, but it is not that nice. It is actually too pricey for what it is. This is NOT a Hilton, it is just owned by Hilton. Self parking is $46 and $55 with valet parking. The heater in the room wasn't working so we had cold nights, even though we asked for maintenance and they told us twice that they will send an engineer, but he never came.",nan,1,ex1370
expedia,"Heating vent was right over the bed and never turned off. Was sick (slept) the whole trip, bed was very comfortable.",nan,1,ex1371

expedia,Stayed at this hotel for a quick getaway. Excellent staff and valet service! Good location! Free breakfast was a plus! Nice little buffet with plenty to choose from! When I stay at a hotel I look more for location than fancy hotel rooms and services included. So for me it was a great hotel for the money!,nan,1,ex1376
expedia,Great hotel. Concierge were extremely helpful and courteous! Buffet breakfast was delicious and beyond our expectations. Would definitely recommend this hotel to others.,nan,1,ex1377
expedia,overall very satisfied. hotel is at a great location and staff was very friendly the entire time.,nan,1,ex1378
expedia,"Hotel facilities itself are nice and clean. Very convienent to restaurants, shopping & nightlife. Rooms were clean, bed was comfortable. Front desk staff were not thorough, when I was done with checking in the lady just turned her back on me. She didn't say anything about the transaction being done, I had to ask if we were finished.",nan,1,ex1379
expedia,"Great place for family with swimming, free breakfast, convenient location, and very helpful staff.",nan,1,ex1380
expedia,"I stayed 5 nights. Reception staff is very rude. When I checked in they never greet me or say Hi to me. Just charged my credit card even without telling me. In the room wash basin is cracked. kitchen water faucet is broken. Tried to turn down the faucet and it broke & dropped in to my plate. I manage to put it back. Room service never clean counter tops.They never replaced my tea bags/creamer/sugar for coffee. I informed reception about it and it took more than hour and never showed up. I went to store bought it then went to reception and told. Instead of apologizing, receptionist start arguing with me saying they put some supplies in my room. No manager to talk per receptionist. Also inside room is too warm. After i informed an engineer showed up. he told me air condition is not working it is turned down. Only air conditioning is open the room windows per engineers recommendation. Bathroom shampoo/soap/body lotion replaced only once. Even I complained about all these no one contacted me even with a apology. Restaurant and door staff is good and they do what they can. I been traveling many times and stayed in different hotel. This is the worst experience so far. Fairmont hotel in Vancouver Canada is excellent. Anyone need to know what is real customer service go to Fairmont Vancouver. This Homewood management need to send their staff to Fairmont hotel to find out how to serve your guest. Homewood is a place you MUST avoid no matter what is the deal you get. DO NOT STAY.",nan,1,ex1381
expedia,a bit unsual as the lobby is on the 6th floor. no room service. Large and well equiped kitchen area.Full size refrigerator Lovely comfortable bed. Room was VERY quiet-and we stayed on St Paddy's day weekend. Valet parking was expensive but efficient and friendly.,nan,1,ex1382
expedia,"While staying at the Homewood Suites in Chicago, we experienced friendly staff from the valet to the reception area. I was pleased to know the ""EL"" subway system at State and Grand was within 1 block from the hotel, this was very helpful for us being new to the city. The room itself was comfortable and spacious, but the floor boards in the kitchen were separating and some of the outlets were crooked (MINOR ISSUES). My husband felt breakfast was catered to the adult population and we were traveling with 2 children, I felt it was sufficient for our stay. When we return to the city we will look here first. It was close to shopping and a short ride to any attraction using public transportation. We lucked out because, I didn't look for access to transportation close to the hotel and was pleasantly surprised by the system close to us. (use this as apart of your appeal to the people!!!!) All in all, I would stay here again and my 6 year old daughter had so much fun she wants to move to Chicago....",nan,1,ex1383
expedia,This hotel is in the middle of everything in Chicago Downtown. Our room was ready on time and the staff was very friendly. The hotel room was clean and open-spaced. It was very quiet and the pool was clean.,nan,1,ex1384
expedia,"It was a wonderful experience, breakfast was great and staff was excellent.",nan,1,ex1385
expedia,It is good that the room we stay has a kitchen. The suite is too small compared with the Hilton I stayed. Two ladies at the reception were reluctant to answer the questions. I didn't feel like being at home. The only thing that we felt good about was the breakfast and the reception. The waitress is so nice. The sink in the bathroom was cracked and broken. It looks cheap if it is not repaired properly. I didn't expect that we could not find any parking spot on the street in downtown. We had to pay $55 for parking each day for 7 days. It costs us $400.,nan,1,ex1386
expedia,Hotel did its job. Was able to rest and relax. No issues and got a great rate for my stay!,nan,1,ex1387
expedia,The guy who checked us in was rude and disrespectful throwing me my driver's license and credit card towards me and when we called guest services they would hang up on us. The eye on the stove didn't work our bedroom stayed cold and we ended up with a cold when we asked for a skillet they told us let me see what we can do. Been to Hilton before third was the worst.Won't be back,nan,1,ex1388

expedia,Everything was good except the gentalman at the desk when I checked in very rude,nan,1,ex1390

expedia,"This would be a great place for families! Great buffet breakfast and a fun, rooftop pool, ideal for families. Easy walking distance to great Chicago pizza, coffee, and shopping.",nan,1,ex1392
expedia,"Great location, especially given the poor weather - easy to get to Michigan Ave. via mall entrance across street. Free breakfast was good, and it was nice to have a kitchen. Missed having a mirror for back of head and makeup; a safe would be a good addition.",nan,1,ex1393

We were also close to most everything we wanted to do, and could easily get to anything else from the trains near by. The rooms were all large and clean, it was great to come back to each night. Our two year old had a great time and slept easily in the crib they made available. We loved being able to grab a quick breakfast in the morning. We can't wait to go back.",nan,1,ex1395

expedia,"Hotel staff was very nice and really friendly. Breakfast was a pleasant surprise. All items were kept fresh, they even use real plates and silverware. We never had any problems with the staff. Their is anything that you may need within a short walking distance. I do believe they should update their couch and chair in the suites. The furniture wasn't real comfortable after 10 minutes of sitting. Our 16th floor corner room had a wonderful view.",nan,1,ex1397

expedia,"I have stayed in Chicago at least a dozen times over the years at various hotels and this was definetly one of the better experiences. The staff was friendly and the rooms were suprisingly quiet for downtown Chicago. Also the front desk is on the six floor, the first floor is valet and parking garage occupies the levels in between. I actually liked that the check in desk was not on ground level, made it much more pleasent to go there for questions or to visit the little shop that sells snacks, drinks and souvenirs. The continental breakfast area was across from the check in desk and was nice to go to in the morning.",nan,1,ex1421

Not much knowledge regarding options on nearby tourist attractions. When I asked about a local museum's times, instead of checking, they said, ""I guess that sounds right"". Parking was a fortune, especially since no one told me that there would be extra time added over 24 hours. We checked in at around 2 and left at 5:15. Parking was close to $85. That's a little less than what we paid for the room. Staff was friendly and nice. For what we paid overall for one night, I expected more.",nan,1,ex1442

expedia,"Wonderful Stay ! We took our girls and their families to have a Christmas experience down town. The Hotel was perfect with the King suites, especially with the toddlers. Wanted to take them to Eataly for dinner and it was right around the corner walking distance. Then we all walked to the Daily Plaza enjoying the sights and sounds of the city of Chicago. beds and bathrooms were clean and comfortable. Breakfast in the morning was very nice. Check in and out were smooth, Valet was very nice. We would love to come back next Christmas season for two nights.",nan,1,ex1447
expedia,"This was my first time ti downtown Chicago so I was a bit worried I'd have problems. It all worked out well. We found our hotel easily, and pulled up in front. We grabbed our stuff and they took our car. We checked into our room with friendly helpful staff, and were very pleased with our room. It was very roomy along with a nice mini kitchen. The view was nice, and we were able to walk to all the attractions that we wanted to see. Then there was the breakfast. Outstanding! Very happy with the choices for breakfast. We had a great experience here, and will probably do it again.",nan,1,ex1448
expedia,"We were really happy with the location. Easy access from the airport and to shopping, attractions. Breakfasts were great but the one supper (supper only available during the week) we had we could have passed on. Though it was free, there are many better places to visit that are close by. Beds were ok, but overall we were really happy with the accommodations.",nan,1,ex1449
expedia,"We loved this hotel. It was close to everything, especially transit and shopping, and the staff were unfailingly courteous and helpful. The furniture was a bit run down and the sofa bed was too small and quite uncomfortable, but aside from this our experience was a pleasant one. Very reasonable, too, for downtown Chicago.",nan,1,ex1450
expedia,"This hotel is located just behind Nordstrom's north of the river. Gorgeous views of Wrigley Bldg, Trump and city from the pool on top floor. EASY walk to State Street, Water Tower, or any public transit. Tons of well-known eateries nearby. Cabs galore. Room was very clean, spacious and comfortable with a lot of attention to detail, e.g. quality coffee with little creamers, well-stocked kitchen, Neutrogena toiletries, huge flat screen TVs, comfortable bedding with plenty of pillows.. Breakfast was wonderful--hot fluffy eggs with cheese and chives, sausage, biscuits and gravy, cereals, Danish, yogurt with fresh fruit, French toast with fruit and whipped cream, and great coffee. Second morning things seemed a bit over-nuked or something, but still OK. Clientele was polite and well-groomed. Have stayed in many Chicago hotels. This was a GREAT STAY and we will be back!",nan,1,ex1451
expedia,"From the valet service, the guys were polite and friendly Check in a breeze, Homewood inn suites is clean warm friendly service outstanding We went in to Chicago for a Christmas weekend with are daughters and their families . The room a perfect for my grandchildren, very accommodating We all had a great posituve experience Would come back again for two nights",nan,1,ex1452
expedia,You couldn't ask for a better downtown Chicago location. Walking distance to Macy's and State Street as well as Michigan Avenue. Full kitchen and separate bedroom as well. I live in Chicago and I was acting like a tourist all weekend!,nan,1,ex1453
expedia,Very nice Suite. Great location for the Mile,nan,1,ex1454
expedia,"I do a lot of traveling to Chicago for work and have tried a lot of hotels, and I have to say this has been the best so far. Location right near a subway stop, great location, spacious rooms, clean and comfortable. One of the best perks is free breakfast every day and free dinner mon thru wed.",nan,1,ex1455
expedia,My sister and I stayed at the hotel in November of this year. We arrived at the hotel at 10:30 and we were able to leave our bags so we could start our shopping. Our room was really nice and the staff was kind and accommodating.,nan,1,ex1456
expedia,"If you have a car, add $55+tips to the price per day for parking so not such a great deal when you figure that in. Will likely shop for a parking included hotel next time I visit Chicago or stay on the perimeter at a suburban location where parking is not a premium.",nan,1,ex1457
expedia,"Wonderful, right in the heart of downtown Chicago. Everything about the hotel was great. They were helpful, and the breakfast and dinner was fabulous. The room was superior to other hotel rooms as you have the three distinct areas of bedroom, kitchen and living room.",nan,1,ex1458
expedia,We stayed for one night. The hotel location is very good. Everything is walking distance. The reception guy was not friendly at all. He even did not see us when we talk. He threw back my ID and credit card. Except this guy we overall enjoyed our stay.,nan,1,ex1459
expedia,"Good service, nice room and great location. When we go back Chicago we will stay there again.",nan,1,ex1460
expedia,"The hotel itself probably has seen better days. The rooms and the building itself are a little run-down (furniture-wise/ interior-wise), e.g. the door between living room and bedroom wouldn't close properly, the wood on the bottom of the bathroom door was rotten (due to humidity) , all of the seating furniture was stained. The main problem for me was that the hotel is partially a smoking hotel and you can smell that basically everywhere. I made the mistake and wanted to use the laundry room on the 7th floor which is a smoking floor. Disgusting is all I can say. I didn't even get to the laundry room because the smell made me gag. On the other hand the staff was amazing. Always helpful und friendly. We needed an extra crib and a highchair. Both was brought to our room within a few minutes. Aside from the interior, the room was cleaned well (bathroom, floors, bed), in terms of cleanness everything made a good impression. The breakfast room is in the same shape as everything else but it was clean and breakfast was good, nothing special but good. Also the location of this hotel is extremely convenient and central, about 2 minutes from Michigan Ave and about 5 minutes from the German Consulate which was the main purpose for our visit this time. Overall it's an ok hotel if you know what to expect.",nan,1,ex1461
expedia,Okay 1 night stay. Very convenient hotel - close to Red line. Had been looking forward to swimming - pool is empty. Staff were helpful.,nan,1,ex1462

expedia,Great location.,nan,1,ex1466
expedia,Had wonderful trip. Breakfast was awesome. Excellent location.,nan,1,ex1467
expedia,"A little disappointed after expectations from pictures. Very small rooms, and even terrible if you have to pull the couch out. Usually stay at Embassy Suites, tried this because of location. Never should of done the change, embassy suites or even just a straight hotel room for now on. Never even tried the free breakfast after seeing it and elevators were few and crowded.",nan,1,ex1468
expedia,"We had two adjacent rooms, both well-equipped with full kitchens, which was very convenient for leftovers. Rooms were very quiet, and staff were uniformly friendly and helpful. Complimentary breakfast and dinner buffets are an added bonus. Would definitely stay again.",nan,1,ex1469
expedia,"It was noisy at night time, elevator took too long and breakfast items could have been a little better. On the other hand, Amir gave us Great customer service and Front Desk personal was very friendly and helpful. All the staff was attentive and tried their best to meet our needs.",nan,1,ex1470
expedia,This was our families second year staying at the Homewood suites and it was great! Check in was easy and the staff was very friendly along with the valet men always willing to help!room was very clean and loved that it had a fridge and microwave for quick snacks. There was a couple down falls that were irritating. The elevators are so slow and there seems to only be one working all the times it was very inconvenient when your trying to leave..we weren't the only ones that felt like this. The breakfast was great that it was free and very tasteful but there wasn't enough food and we had to wait a long time for the staff to refill items..That made the wait to be seated longer because people were waiting for the food and we had to wait to be seated when a table became free.Even with the couple flaws we will return again next year.,nan,1,ex1471
expedia,"I wanted to take my two young girls for a weekend in the city this hotel was perfect! Nothing to fancy, close to everything, affordable... Perfect! The staff was extremely helpful and friendly. My only complaint was that the hotel had some wear and tear but overall rooms were spacious and clean,",nan,1,ex1472
expedia,"I like very much my stay Great location Friendly staff, especially at front desk Thanks",nan,1,ex1473
expedia,"Great location, clean room, friendly staff. Only complaint is the laundry room dryers. I really think the vents need to be cleaned because the dryers took forever to dry clothes.",nan,1,ex1474
expedia,"The staff was great, very welcoming, and friendly to my two little ones. The rooms are nice, give you a lot of options (with a kitchen, and pull out couch). You can save money and eat in. It appeared they would shop for groceries if you filled out the form. The rooms were a bit dated in some respects, but not enough to detract from the value of the location. Breakfast was full and warm with eggs, sausage, french toast and hashbrowns.",nan,1,ex1475
expedia,"Used this hotel for a 2 day girls trip. Worked out well. Breakfast was good and the 24 hour coffee was great. I was looking forward to some hot apple cider but I missed out because it wasn't stocked. Free dinner on Monday night was very good. If you have long hair, you may want to bring your own hair dryer. Ours shorted out after running for about 20 seconds. It's a nice hotel with great service, good food, good location. I would definitely stay there again.",nan,1,ex1476
expedia,Fabulous location. Great service. Only thing was the WiFi.couldn't get it to work in the room. Was quiet and comfortable.,nan,1,ex1477

expedia,"Clean, comfortable, and within close walking distance of everything you could want or need.",nan,1,ex1483
expedia,"Everything was great - the location, valet service, the large suite and more.",nan,1,ex1484
expedia,"Close to everything and perfect room for a family of three -- kid sleeps on sofa bed, parents get a bedroom. Free hot breakfast was perfect and convenient -- could use some stronger coffee (the robust blend didn't live up to its name), but you can't expect great coffee from a hotel, I guess. We hit the Starbucks across the street each morning anyway. Dinners at manager's reception were fine and a nice way to save some $$ for other touristy stuff while on vacation. Only downside was some construction noise overnight, apparently in the same building as the hotel, but not from the hotel itself. We were awakened with drillling/buzzing noises starting at 4:30-5:00am our last two mornings.",nan,1,ex1485
expedia,"I loved Homewood Suites in CHicago. This is the first time I have ever stayed in this establishment and NOW i will not go any where else. After this trip, I will always look to find a Homewood Suites at my future vacation destinations. Loved the price, size, employees, location, on and on. Very satisfied.",nan,1,ex1486
expedia,Hotel was very close to everything downtown has to offer. Room was very clean and spacious.,nan,1,ex1487
expedia,Very inviting and helpful staff. Will definetly recommend and stay there again.,nan,1,ex1488
expedia,Everything was great. They had a room available for us to check in early. Very nice when traveling. Didn't have to haul luggage around all day. All employees were very helpful. Rooms and hotel were clean. The location was very centrally located downtown. Good for walking almost anywhere. Only complaint was the bathroom door hit the toilet when opening and closing. All around a great value with the breakfast and managers dinner.,nan,1,ex1489
expedia,"My husband and I came to Chicago to celebrate our 10th anniversary. We really liked just about everything about this hotel. They had a pool, free breakfast, a free dinner, free use of the gym and within walking distance to a lot of attractions. The rooms were clean and a lot bigger than some of the other rooms we've stayed in ( this was our 4th trip). We really liked that it had a full size fridge that we could put drinks and leftovers from meals in. The staff was super friendly and accommodating. We will definitely book our next trip here.",nan,1,ex1490
expedia,"The hotel was in a good location. Our longest walk was to Willis Tower. It took 30 mins. Breakfast wasn't always hot. Sometimes a little on the cold side but overall tasted good. Some remodeling is needed. Carpet wear in some areas. Bathrooms need an exhaust fan. There was some black mold in the bathroom. But yes, I will stay there again.",nan,1,ex1491
expedia,"The Homewood Suites on Grand Avenue in Chicago was such a great place to stay! The staff were the most friendly and helpful people that I have ever encountered in a hotel! They made us feel like we really mattered to them. What a blessing we received from them. The breakfast and supper that is included with your stay was phenomenal! It was delicious, hot, and plentiful. This hotel is located in a wonderful area, close to everything. We will definitely be staying there again any time we go to Chicago! Well done Homewood Suites!",nan,1,ex1492
expedia,"It was a good stay. I needed a train schedule for the subway to get to a White Sox and a Cubs baseball game and was surprised that the hotel did not have any pamphlets/brochures/train schedules/info. Other than this issue, it was a great hotel w/ awesome location and a great morning breakfast. I would recommend this hotel to anyone staying in downtown Chicago. rooms were very clean and the staff was very helpful.",nan,1,ex1493
expedia,Awesome stay. The room was very comfortable and the breakfast was delicious and staff very efficient. Had a great time! Location was very convenient to public transportation which made getting around great.,nan,1,ex1494
expedia,"This was a fantastic hotel. Great price, great room, great food, amazing views from beautiful indoor pool (on 19th floor!). I was very happy with our stay. Staff was very helpful (gave my son a coloring book and crayons at check-in), etc... We will definitely be staying here going forward. The only somewhat negative thing I noticed was some partially frayed carpet b/w the bathroom and the bedroom. This could have easily cut by house keeping, but it looked like it had been there awhile. Again, the carpet didn't need to be replaced, but just that string could have been trimmed. Also, I asked for foam pillows and they sent more firm feather pillows. They did the job, but I would have preferred true foam pillows being available. So those are the only reasons I downgraded my 5 to a 4 in the category of condition or maintenance of the hotel. Otherwise VERY satisfied!!!",nan,1,ex1495
expedia,Great location. Close to restaurants and stores. Bring comfy shoes cause u will use them on your adventures. We would stay here again. Breakfast was another great positive!,nan,1,ex1496
expedia,"We had a very pleasant stay. We arrived in Chicago about 6 hours before check-in time and when we asked to check our bags, they said they had our room available and checked us in immediately. Room was huge and very clean. There was one night that our door lock wouldn't let us in the room but maintenance was there under in under 5 minutes to fix the problem. Everyone was courteous. Great stay. Would definitely come back.",nan,1,ex1497
expedia,Loved the conveniences...fridge..microwave. Sofa bed much more comfortable with extra blanket to cushion the springs. Excellent housekeeping services,nan,1,ex1498
expedia,We enjoy going to Chicago as a family. Homewood suites was a great hotel and awesome location. We could walk to everything we enjoy doing.,nan,1,ex1499
expedia,"This is a very good hotel with lots to offer, since it is a ""suites"" type of room (at least our room was) extra room, kitchen, etc. The free breakfast AND free evening ""dinner"" were a big help to the budget, although not gourmet, still very nice! Free internet is a savings, too, although it is not ""premium high speed"", it was ok. These extras may not be all that helpful for just one business traveler, but great for families. Location is just a block or two from Magnificent Mile and one block from the Red Line CTA train system. All the staff that we encountered were pleasant and helpful.",nan,1,ex1500
expedia,Homewood suites had a great complementary breakfast and the children enjoyed the pool and it was close to the transit so we could get to any where we wanted to go,nan,1,ex1501
expedia,"We live in Chicago and when we stay downtown it is usually splash out on getting away form the kids. This is not one of those places, but it is a great place for a more Unitarian stay. Excellent location, ample parking so you do not need to valet, ease access to the interstates and the rooms were amazingly clean and large. A surprise given the price, location and, generally, tourist clientele. I would definitely recommend as a place to stay downtown and have already recommended it to another person for a central family vacation homebase.",nan,1,ex1502
expedia,"It's a suite. Great for families. Located in a great place, steps from the Mile, and surrounded by great restaurants and shops.",nan,1,ex1503
expedia,Great clean hotel. Staff at breakfast were so friendly and apologetic about the brief wait we had for a table. Pool was OK but had a nice top floor view. My husband tried to use the exercise room in the morning but all of the equipment was in use.,nan,1,ex1504
expedia,"A great hotel and location. The team of staff at this hotel really understand how to deliver fantastic service, the front door team had a challenge to find me a large taxi for our luggage, the guy must have ran 500yrds down the road to get me the right car, now that's service! Would not hesitate to recommend and return. One of the best Hilton hotels we have ever visited. Roger & Jackie UK.",nan,1,ex1505
expedia,This hotel is in a great location. The breakfast was good and they sat people as tables open up. I was surprised to find out the lobby was on the 6th floor. There were only two elevators so you had to wait at times and then the elevators got pretty crowded. I had an issue with my ears hurting because we were on a higher floor and I asked the hotel if I could cancel my remaining reservation and they did without hesitating. If I had been able to be on a lower floor we would have loved to have stayed.,nan,1,ex1506
expedia,We stayed for part business/ part leisure. The suite was spacious. Staff very friendly. Excellent location 1 block from Magnificent Mile. Free hot breakfast buffet and free dinner Mo - Thur 5 to 7pm called Manager's Reception. Excellent value.,nan,1,ex1507
expedia,"Central downtown location, close to food, shopping and local sites. Very clean and spacious rooms. Excellent hot breakfast. Very friendly and responsive staff. Great family facilities.",nan,1,ex1508
expedia,"We traveled with our two kids (both under 10) These rooms have a great layout complete with a full working kitchen and living room area. We were able to bring snacks and there was plenty of space for the kids to play and set up their toys without taking over the entire room! With a door dividing the living room and bedroom, we could put the kids to bed and still have space to stay up relax while the kids slept. Great location, lots within walking distance, close to the free trolley stop and minimal cab fare to most main attractions. The hotel itself was a little dated but that didn't bother us, the staff, especially in valet area, were incredibly helpful and upbeat. The elevator was slow and very busy (only two to accommodate 17 floors of rooms and we think one wasn't functioning), that became a bit of a hassle but we just used the stairs since we were only on floor 9, if we had been on 17 it would have been more of a nuisance. We will definitely be back and recommend to anyone, especially those traveling with kids!",nan,1,ex1509
expedia,Very close to subway and great eating establishments. Very close to shopping as well. Outstanding free breakfast in the morning. Only problem was I specifically reserved a non-smoking room and we did not get one the first night. We went to the cub game and didn't check in until late. They couldn't move us because the hotel was completely booked. I was pretty disappointed because I booked this way back in February. The night manager said we would be moved immediately in the morning but when you are spending $300 per night - you want to be comfortable which my wife and I were not. I would also like to mention the manager have us a free night off our bill. I was really impressed with their customer service as well. This made up for the night in the smoking room. Overall the beds were comfortable and spacey rooms as well. We had a good experience besides what you read above.,nan,1,ex1510
expedia,"We had a great time in chicago with our children. The hotel was in the perfect spot and we could walk to almost everything we planned to do. One of the elevators were broke most of our stay and the wait was long to get on. We stayed on the 19 th floor. Kids loved the pool, the view was beautiful, staff friendly, food good and rooms clean.",nan,1,ex1511
expedia,"Traveling with my nieces on their first trip to Chicago, we had an all-around good time. Staff were efficient and friendly with quick valet service and check-in. We were pleased about the hotel's location near the shopping, Navy Pier, multitudes of restaurants, etc. The girls enjoyed the pool up on the 19th floor with a great view. Breakfast in the morning was good but waiting for a table was a bit annoying. The staff member that was trying to get everyone a table as quick as possible was doing an excellent job but has a difficult task.",nan,1,ex1512
expedia,Rooms were clean and spacious. Staff was extremely friendly. There were many families staying so sometimes the elevator was slow or crowded. Free morning breakfast Buffett was convenient but didn't offer much variety day to day.,nan,1,ex1513
expedia,"Location was fantastic. Walking distance to everything. Public transit right around the corner. Restaurants, markets, shopping (Magnificent Mile) all within a five minute walk. Very safe neighborhood. Hotel was super clean and the morning breakfast/evening dinner was icing on the cake! Hotel staff were professional, knowledgeable and super friendly. We were new to Chicago and the hotel staff gave us recommendations that were spot on! My kids loved the indoor swimming pool and the views. I loved the cleanliness and convenience of the hotel. All rooms have a small kitchen which was well stocked and cleaned daily. The hotel price was extremely reasonable for the area and no hidden fee surprises. When we return to Chicago, we will definitely stay at the Homewood suites again!",nan,1,ex1514

Easy access to train/subway station 1 block to the west. The staff was friendly and helpful. Was pleasantly surprised that there was a reception (dinner) on week nights on top of the hot breakfast that was included in the room rate. If Siskel and Ebert were rating it , it would be 2 thumbs up.",nan,1,ex1516

expedia,"Got to the hotel early. Left bags and car with very attentive and efficient staff. Walked to Nordstrom's. Practically next door. Then down to millennium park. And the theater district. All an easy 20 minute walk. Room was very nice. Skipped the complimentary breakfast, but it seemed ok.",nan,1,ex1519
expedia,Rooms were clean and comfortable. Location was outstanding. Breakfast food was typical buffet - hot foods not very hot.,nan,1,ex1520
expedia,"The hotel's location was excellent. The breakfast was adequate. Also, provided was free dinners from Monday to Thursday. The lack of gluten-free was a problem. Rooms were comfortable, being one bedroom apartments. Rooms were serviced daily and presented very well each day.",nan,1,ex1521
expedia,"This hotel is located in the heart of Chicago downtown, just 2 blocks to the magnificent mile and the main atractions were within walking distance. The room was not big enough to accomodate a family with 2 kids (it is not a spacious suite). There is a fridge and a small kitchenette, if you prefer to prepare some food in the room. The hotel serves complimentary breakfast (every day) and dinner (Mon-Thu), however the area designated for breakfast and dinner is always crowded. You may use free wi-fi througout the hotel but you need to renew your connection everday. In conclusion, smaller rooms with basic suit amenities, superb location and free breakfast/dinner which may be a preferance for families with children.",nan,1,ex1522

Highly recommend for an extended or a short stay!",nan,1,ex1523
expedia,"This hotel was perfect for this small town girl and her family. The location was walking distance from Magnificent Mile, Navy Pier, the bean and good restaurants. I felt very safe, and the view from our room at night was like a postcard. The free breakfast was awesome but get there early 7 -730 or you will wait in line. You can bring your food back to the room if there are no seats. There is a Jewel/Osco grocery store about a block away. Load up on soft drinks and snacks. There are no vending machines however there is a very small store that has bottled pop for 3.00. Kinda pricy when you can get a 6 pack a block away for 3.99. We took the water taxi to and from Union Station which made the experience even more fun. Make sure to go to the Science Museum...took the bus for 2.25 each. The front desk is very helpful in the trying to figure out which bus to take. Everyone on the bus is pretty much going to the same place so it is easy to figure out when to get off. There is also a free trolley to Navy Pier. The room was a bit outdated but the bed was super comfy and everything was clean. I would definitely stay here again.",nan,1,ex1524

expedia,"We had an amazing time staying at Homewood suites. The room was spacious and clean. Staff was friendly, and the hotel was in the heart of city. Close walk to the Navy Pier, major shopping stores, great restaurants, water taxis, and the riverfront walkway. The breakfast was great, but you should show up early before it gets crowded. They offer free dinner, but we were always too full from lunch to take an advantage of it. Free coffee, tea, and hot chocolate around the clock. The beds were very clean and comfortable, even the fold out couch was amazingly comfortable. The refrigerator has an ice maker so you don't have to retrieve ice from an outside ice machine. We had a blast and cannot wait to go back. We would definitely stay at this hotel again and again. This is a very kid friendly and pet friendly place.",nan,1,ex1526

expedia,"Will not stay there again. Second day ran out of food one hour before breakfast ended, no room to sit for breakfast. Had to take the scraps thE scraps that were left from the buffet up to room to eat. Room needs to be updated. Pull out couch was like sleeping on springs with no padding. Worst Homewood Suite I have stayed at. With the prices hey charge, money should be used to update. Very disappointing. Will not go back.",nan,1,ex1547
expedia,"Other than maybe needing to be updated a bit, everything was great. The staff was very friendly and helpful. Having the little mini kitchen was very nice. The location is VERY convenient. It's very close to michigan avenue, about a block and a half away, where you can also find buses to most touristy things, and the bonus is, the red line is just about a block away in the other direction. The breakfast is the typical hotel hot breakfast, nothing special. The waffles were good though. The pool was a decent size and seemed well maintained.",nan,1,ex1548
expedia,"Location was perfect, 2 blocks from magnificent mile. $15 cab ride to museum. You can save $ by eating breakfast AND dinner at the hotel, (dinner is served mon-thur) but it was a step up from your usual little motels you see filled with kids...if it was just me and the hubby, I'd prob stay elsewhere... This is aimed at fams or extended stay people...",nan,1,ex1549
expedia,"This was a great hotel for families. The location was perfect for all of our sightseeing and shopping. The staff was eager to help make our stay great!

expedia,Breakfast good with a nice selection. Was very busy but had plenty of seating available. Room nice w/ great views. Comfy beds w/ nice bedding. Room was very warm even when on lowest temperature setting. Parking outrageously overpriced @ $55 per night & valet guys appeared smarmy. Overall a nice stay.,nan,1,ex1553
expedia,We stayed here with our three young children and had a great time! The men at the front door were very helpful and kind! You can pull your car right up to the front door and they will park it for you for a competative rate and allow you unlimited exits and entries for free! We left our stroller and another item in the car by accident and they happily got them for us! We were very impressed!!

Hot breakfast was delicious. It was an overall great stay and I would stay here again. Also, I would highly suggest this location to family and friends.",nan,1,ex1557
expedia,"Overall, this location was very nice. Breakfast was a definite bonus and any staff we encountered were extremely nice. My only real con for this location is the size of their two room suites. We normally stay at another competitor that also offers two room suites which are larger in square footage. Bed was very comfortable, even the pull out sleeper wasn't that bad. All in all, I would definitely stay here again and would recommend to anyone considering staying there.",nan,1,ex1558
expedia,Nice hotel with decent breakfast and weekday dinners. Staff and valet extremely curteous!,nan,1,ex1559

expedia,"Wonderful staff, great location to walk to sights and shopping, loved the free breakfast and free drinks. Would definitely reccomend this hotel to everyone!",nan,1,ex1562
expedia,I enjoyed the stay at the Homewood Suites and found the location to be excellent. I stayed with a spouse and 2 children ages 14 and 16 who slept on the pull out bed. The breakfast was largely good and the afternoon snack similarly refreshing. I thought that the service was responsive and excellent. The coffee left something to be desired when the standard seems to be a richer brew and the pull out bed was not reportedly comfortable as a mattress. I would return and am appreciative.,nan,1,ex1563
expedia,"This hotel is right next to Michigan ave. It is in the middle of many restaurants, shopping stores and there is a movie theatre very close. There is also a Trader Joe's behind this hotel where families can get something healthy without spending too much. The frontdesk stuff are very helpful, we never have to wait for taxi for over 1 minute! The rooms are comfortable. We all enjoyed the complimentary breakfast and dinner!",nan,1,ex1564

expedia,"My daughter and I went on a girls trip for spring break..Might I say, this hotel was AWESOME. The breakfast and especially the dinners were top notch. HOMEWOOD SUITES, taking advantage of the meals saved us a lot of money, and they were good, really good. Breakfast got a bit tight, but staff refilled things quickly, so no biggy... I cannot believe we were in the heart of Chicago and able to take advantage of a hotel such as this. We asked for a corner room away from the elevators on a high floor and that is exactly what we got. The view outside our room was spectacular! We were a few blocks from MAG MILE, took the bus to Shed Aquarium, took a nice long walk down State Street to Palmer House, took a cab to Second City, walked to Porcino's and did the River Walk. Hotel staff was so nice, we got spoiled quickly, Our room was spacious and clean, bed soft and comfy. We WILL be back!",nan,1,ex1566

expedia,"I stay a lot of hotels on a regular basis for business and leisure, but this stay was by far the most welcoming. The staff is amazing and treats you like family (at least the ones they like), the hotel provides complimentary breakfast and dinner (on most evenings), it's in a great location! I'll definitely be back.",nan,1,ex1580
expedia,"We chose the hotel because of location, breakfast, the pool and b/c we wanted a suite. I wish the pool area had a hottub, or whirlpool, unfortunately it did not. I wish the fitness room had a fan, but it did not, and anyone who works out will know how quickly you heat up and how stuffy the room becomes. I was not allowed to leave the door open which made for an uncomfortable experience overall. The treadmill also seemed to be off its calibration (in case you are training for something). Love the fully stocked kitchenette. The sofa bed was decent. The king bed was heavenly. My husband and I didn't really eat any of the breakfast items, as there were hardly any vegetarian options. Kids loved it though. We had some very noisy neighbors who decided at midnight it was okay to open and close their doors loudly for 15 minutes non-stop. I called the front desk and within minutes they sent up security and it was nice and quiet again. Would we stay again? The location is excellent, but if they make a few mods it would be better.",nan,1,ex1581
expedia,Muy Buena. Cerca de todo. Se sentia uno como en casa.,nan,1,ex1582
expedia,I like the homewood suites hotel setup. I especially love the free 24 hour coffee tea and hot chocolate in the lobby. These hotels make you feel at home.,nan,1,ex1583

expedia,The staff was friendly. The rooms were big and clean. I would stay here again.,nan,1,ex1585

expedia,I do t think I will be staying there again it was terrible and over crowded and the staff was confused and the front desk was real rude,nan,1,ex1587

expedia,"We checked in on Thursday May 14, 2015. We had separate reservations for 2 nights. We discussed with this with the clerk upon checking in and were assured that everything would be seamless. Well, it was not. After a full day on Friday, we were unable to get our keys to work( a problem with the 2 reservations which we had been told would not be a problem) and then found that house-keeping had not cleaned the room. They offered to clean the room (at 9 pm), we declined and 20 minutes later clean towels were brought to us. The room was stuffy. small and old. My wife would only shower, not bathe, due to the condition of the bath tub. Finally, we were half way to Midway airport upon our departure on Saturday the 16th, when we realized that the Bell desk had not given us all our belongings. Bottom line...this hotel is over-priced and, while very attractive in the public areas, is not a place I would recommend.",nan,1,ex1589
expedia,Perfect....Nice in everything. Good staff. Great environment. I had an awesome experience.,nan,1,ex1590

expedia,"Front desk staff were probably overworked with a lot of guests attending a convention.... but it's a big hotel & they should be happy with the business right? NO! They were obviously overwhelmed and lacked patience to attend to customer's needs. They were inpatient on the phone & sarcastic, & in person refused to help at all. One week of our stay in this pricey but not so fancy hotel was saved by the housekeepers on the 18th floor! They were gracious sweet & funny, God bless them!",nan,1,ex1596
expedia,"Amazing lobby, large comfortable lovely room, efficient and professional staff. Special commendation to Miguel, the warm and welcoming bellman who greets you at the entrance of the hotel.",nan,1,ex1597
expedia,"We only wanted a room for a brief nights sleep after a late evening in the city. Towards that end it was fine. We got a great rate through Expedia at a price that was about 1/3 the normal rate. Even at that rate though, we were disappointed with the overall experience. The room was small, but the bathroom was really tiny with little counter space for toiletries one would normally travel with. The room design was tight- you couldn't open both the closet and bathroom door at the same time and while easy to navigate around that, it was odd. Once we actually got checked into our room about 4:30 pm we noticed there were 2 large bags of dirty laundry directly outside our door and across the hall was another room's discarded room service dishes. We didn't think that much of it when arriving, but was surprised to see it there when we returned after midnight and again the next morning when we checked out about 10:30 am...seems like they have a housekeeping issue. When we arrived the room wasn't ready (we were early so no big deal), but told we could check in early for an additional $25 (seemed odd to upcharge if there were rooms available). We declined and were told we could check our bags at the bellstand down a level for no charge. When we went down a level, we waited in line at the bellstand, only to be told that was just for retrieving bags, not checking them. We were redirected down a hall where another line was waiting. Overall, the Hotel lacked a guest experience focus",nan,1,ex1598
expedia,Hotel rooms are old and tired. Very noisy as it is close to el trains,nan,1,ex1599
expedia,"Quick stay, but will keep on my list! Comfortable room, good breakfast in hotel restaurant. Above average in all categories, with an absolutely stunning lobby. The ceilings alone are worth 5 stars!",nan,1,ex1600

expedia,"Grand hotel, gorgeous lobby, nice staff. Room was clean and roomy for an older hotel, but stains on ottoman were ugly. Noise from room above was loud enough to wake us, sounded like a tumbling team. Even with those two demerits, would recommend this hotel for location and ambiance. TIP- use Park Whiz and save about $25 on self-parking, or just ride the train, it has a stop beside the hotel.",nan,1,ex1604

expedia,We've been at the Palmer House several times and always have a good experience.,nan,1,ex1607
expedia,I booked this hotel over the phone through Expedia and received excellent customer service. I booked Congress Hotel nearby Palmer Hotel and read reviews online that Congress Hotel was haunted. I immediately called Expedia and request to book Palmer Hotel instead. It was probably the best decision I made on this trip because this location is near everything I wanted to see. I watched the Book of Mormon at Bank of America Theatre which is a block away from the hotel.,nan,1,ex1608
expedia,"Good, very very slow elevators. Long waits to come and go, otherwise good.",nan,1,ex1609
expedia,"In Chicago for a weekend, I needed quick access to the Art Institute and chose this place. Its historic character and relatively good price also appealed to me.",nan,1,ex1610
expedia,"The Palmer house is an historic hotel that offers excellent service and amenities. The staff was always helpful and always had a smile. I was also fortunate enough to have great weather while I was in Chicago. The staff was helpful with suggestions for great local food choices and other activities. The room was surprisingly small but when you take into consideration the age and the history that goes with this property, I guess it is understandable. Another fun fact would be the trivia questions that can be seen while riding the elevator or on the menu section on the televisions. The great history of the property jumps out at you as you read all of these interesting tid bits about the famous people that stayed at this property over its amazing history. One more thing about the staff. I must say they have to be one of the friendliest group of people I have ever encountered while staying at a hotel. Not only did they always have a smile but they always had a kind word of two to share. One situation that stands out was on the day of my departure. i was leaving the room with my luggage and one of the employees sees me and says, ""why are you leaving us?"". I felt more like a family friend than a stranger staying in a hotel. I thought to myself, I'm going to use that in my job. It really made my day. What a great property with a great staff. The location ain't bad either. Right in the middle of downtown Chicago. A short walk from all sorts of entertainment. A stay will be enjoyed!!!",nan,1,ex1611
expedia,"Great location, good facility and echos of the past.",nan,1,ex1612
expedia,"We absolutely loved this hotel. It is a really neat hotel to begin with, with lots of character, but still clean, fresh, and well maintained. It is also in an excellent location.

expedia,I see a lot of people and torus cars high rise historical buildings.,nan,1,ex1614
expedia,"Best hotel experience in Chicago yet. Easy check in, nice room, comfortable and quiet. Love the Merlot in the lobby, could have just stayed there. They checked our bicycles for free, awesome place to walk to the Lake Shore bike path then ride. Be sure to visit the Chicago History Museum up by Lincoln Park, you really get to learn about the City. Tesori across the street, great place to eat as is Hackneys a few blocks south. Parking is a bit of an issue...but that's Chicago for ya'. The highlight of the trip though, was talking with Ed Asner in the lobby. Great guy !",nan,1,ex1615

expedia,Great hotel. Wonderful staff. I would definitely stay there again.,nan,1,ex1617

expedia,"Close to Chicago Art Museum, Symphony Center, Russian Tea Room, and Millenium Park! Comfortable beds with pristine cotton sheets made sleeping easy. The windows open and provide fresh air in addition to fine views including low clouds during our stay. Pleasant staff will store your bags before check in and after check out so you have more time to enjoy the city unencumbered. Having Mertz Pharmacy in the complex is very enjoyable. We plan on returning to The Palmer House.",nan,1,ex1619
expedia,"We really enjoyed our stay at The Palmer House and found it close to many downtown amenities, including shopping, restaurants, transportation and activities. Union Station was relatively close and the day was nice enough to walk to the hotel. If you don't want to walk, bus stops are close as are many taxi's ready to take you to wherever you desire to go. We were also just a block or so away from Michigan Ave. and had the weather been nicer we could have walked to most everywhere. A 15 minute taxi ride got us to the Museum campus including Shedd Aquarium and the The Field Museum. We easily walked to Millennium Park(The Bean) as well as the restaurants that we ate dinner at. For breakfast, we bought the room package that included the breakfast buffet, and we left full both days with a variety of food that made all 4 of us happy! The staff was very pleasant and welcoming, and while the bathrooms were on the small side (this is an old hotel!), the room was very comfortable and roomy. The beds were kind of tight, with 2 people per 2 full size beds, so I would recommend upgrading to a larger bed if possible. Also, if you want a room with the lake view, be forewarned that the ""L"" is right below, and if you're a light sleeper (as I am ) you may still hear it on the 23rd floor. Overall, though, we had a great experience and will be back again!",nan,1,ex1620

expedia,Really liked the 2 bathrooms in the room and the cable channel selection for the kids. My only complaint was the pool was too cold.,nan,1,ex1625
expedia,The hotel is a great place to stay as long as you get good hotel neighbors. I called the front desk twice to ask for someone to help remedy the very long guests. After a half hour (past midnight) the noice was reduced. Disappointed that we did not get a good nights sleep but the accommodations were fine. Can't really say too much about the staff on duty that night though.,nan,1,ex1626
expedia,"The hotel was just steps away from a ton of shopping and entertainment. The first room that we were placed in wasn't cleaned thoroughly and had stuff splashed on the walls in various parts of the room. However they were able to get us moved to another room within minutes, although the other room was a tad smaller. Overall I would stay there again",nan,1,ex1627
expedia,"The Palmer House is an old fashioned grand hotel with all the pluses and minuses that go with that. Everything you can think of is available in the hotel, but not so much in the rooms. There is no coffee maker, iron, or mini-fridge in the rooms. WiFi in room is expensive. With the exception of ice all other amenities are on the ground and lobby floors and not on the individual hotel floors. However, concierge is very helpful; the computer center with computers, internet and printer is free and uncrowded; luggage storage is free. The restaurant quite nice and not overly crowded. All of the staff are friendly, knowledgeable, and helpful. The art deco room decor and the Victorian decoration elsewhere is charming. The Lobby ceiling is spectacular. The hotel is perfectly placed for Chicago touristing just one block from the Art Institute and right on the metra.",nan,1,ex1628

expedia,Has been many years ago that I had been there and had no idea that they had remodeled. Such a memory builder that I hope to revisit soon.,nan,1,ex1633
expedia,Hotel was gorgeous! But we were surprised at how small the room was. Paid only $159/night but regular price is $344/night that's crazy!! Hotel is so centrally located. The bus and parking garage is very close and really the Palmer house is quite prestigious... Our room was across from the elevator and was a lot noisier than anyone would have liked (at ALL hours too! ) All and all it was a nice hotel and room but I wouldn't have stayed if not for the great deal I'd gotten.,nan,1,ex1634
expedia,"Staying in Chicago for an overnight and wanted something in the theater district. This was well worth the stay! The interior of the lobby is beautiful.

expedia,"Prime location and excellent staff. A must if you are visiting Chicago on business and only have some spare time for sightseeing. At Palmer House Hilton you'll be just steps away from the Millennium Park and all the amazing architecture in and around the loop. The fitness center is top notch with a decent number of machines and free weights. The pool is quite small and closes at 9pm but the gym is 24/7. There's a spa in the building and a shopping center at the street level. This hotel couldn't be much more central. This was my first visit to Chicago and I really wanted to get some sightseeing in between all the meetings and time at the McCormick Place. Well, being at Palmer House Hilton I could easily get a good fill of the waterfront and nearby architecture without investing much more than an hour and a half. The rooms are clean and comfortable. I wish I had a fridge in mine (it's easy to end up with leftover deep dish from Giordano's!) but I was happy with the accommodation. Don't count on a view, however and depending on where your room is you may need a bit of time to get used to the sound of the L trains. Also, take photos of the ceiling in the lobby! It's magnificent! What a location for the hotel bar!",nan,1,ex1640
expedia,Rooms are small and worn. Front desk staff is not helpful. I tried to get a room and they told me they were sold out. I asked if they could recommend another Hilton hotel nearby and they told me they didn't know of any. I stepped away and booked a room in their hotel 2 minutes later via Expedia.,nan,1,ex1641

expedia,"The lounge, halls, bar, and room were elegant. Beautiful. Seemed very fancy for the price. Great location: very close to Millennium Park, great restaurants, plenty of train stops. Room was comfortable and plenty of HBO on TV, but bathroom was very small, the bathroom door did not keep closed, no active vent fan in bathroom. Worst thing was the staff. I'm an engineer by trade and I like to dress comfortably (button up flannel and jeans), and every lobby desk worker seemed to speak 1 decibel above audible, keep eyes fixed on their computer screens, and deliver the coldest smiles. A very obvious lack of warmth. This was also true for the greeter at the hotel restaurant, the Lockwood, though the waiter was nice and the food not the worst (but not worth the price tag). Go to the Gage gastropub 2 blocks away. All in all, the stay was adequate but not worthy of a return visit.",nan,1,ex1644

expedia,The hotel and staff was great...everyone was helpful and friendly and the atmosphere was great! I would stay here again,nan,1,ex1648
expedia,"The staff were generally helpful and some were very friendly, though some (especially some of the doormen and some of the restaurant staff) had more Chicago attitude than American friendliness. It would be nice if the doorman could pool tips with the bellmen, rather than holding his hand out for a separate tip. He might also try opening the (extremely difficult to open) door to the hotel for guests once in a while. The rooms were extremely spacious, though perhaps in need of a lick of paint and some new carpeting. And the bathrooms are well overdue for renewal. The public areas, however, are gorgeous in the extreme and it is lovely just to walk around the hotel.",nan,1,ex1649
expedia,"My wife and I had a great time at the hotel. The heated swimming pool and the great breakfast buffet that came with our room was amazing!!! It is literally located right off State street, so after we checked out, we were able to leave our bags at the hotel and go shopping. It was a great experience! One issue was that our first room had a bug in it...but they moved us to another room with no problem at all.",nan,1,ex1650

expedia,"We stayed in the Palmer House because we were seeing a magic show in the same building. The show was excellent and the convenience of being in the same building during the winter was excellent as well. I enjoyed the beauty of the hotel and the service in the Potter's Lounge. I would recommend staying here again, but beware there is no valet, only self-park. You get a 3 dollar discount from the hotel for parking.",nan,1,ex1654
expedia,"Great time, great location........goto Millers Pub for dinner.",nan,1,ex1655
expedia,The hotel is beautiful and the food and staff were excellent. The hotel was very clean but the room cleaning staff could do a better job in the bathroom. Our room was small but very comfortable and quiet. Close to great shopping and theaters. Would definitely stay there again!,nan,1,ex1656

expedia,The hotel is absolutely gorgeous! We stayed in a less expensive room and the comfort reflected that. The bathroom was very small. Next time we'll stay in a more expensive room. The hotel bar area was so nice and service was excellent all around. We also appreciated the free printing offered in the main lobby.,nan,1,ex1660
expedia,EXCELLENT!!,nan,1,ex1661
expedia,"No complaints, except I wish the bathroom would have been as upscale as everything else.",nan,1,ex1662
expedia,Beautiful historic hotel. Staff very accommodating. The rooms were disappointingly small (with thin walls!) and in poor condition for such a grand hotel. The only way we'd revisit would be with a room upgrade.,nan,1,ex1663
expedia,"I love the Palmer House and always stay here when in Chicago. It is a great, historical hotel right in the middle of the Chicago Loop. It is right on the Blue Line of the Chicago El from O'Hare Airport. It is one to four blocks walk to world-class public outdoor art (including the sculptures of Chagall, Picasso, Moore, And Miro); the Art Institute; Millennium Park; theaters; restaurants; bars/taverns and everything that makes downtown Chicago wonderful. The hotel interior is fabulous to see. The entire lobby area is like being in an Italian Art Museum with a ceiling that has to be seen to be believed. Get a drink at the bar and people watch. The rooms are comfortable, clean and quiet. Some may think the rooms are small, but that is the very nature of what historical, early 1900s, city-center hotels are all about. I always recommend the Palmer House.",nan,1,ex1664
expedia,Some other room left roomservice plates in hallway. They were there the entire 23 hours we stayed at the hotel.,nan,1,ex1665
expedia,This place is great! I would stay again and again. Staff was superb! Location is perfect!,nan,1,ex1666
expedia,Was a nice stay a little expensive for just a bed to keep in we enjoyed our adventure!,nan,1,ex1667
expedia,"The stay was very comfortable, the staff was outstanding!",nan,1,ex1668
expedia,"Stayed in executive suite. It was definitely worth it. Very large rooms. Nice continental breakfast. Our room had 3 bathrooms but they were each very small. Work out facility was great. Pool, well, they had one...",nan,1,ex1669
expedia,concierge gave great recommendations and printed out directions. Fabulous! Had to consult with the doctor on call (Dr. K) who was really great! Really appreciate that service was available and so easy.,nan,1,ex1670
expedia,"My boyfriend and I had a romantic getaway for Valentine's Day! The hotel was great except when checking in, we were given a key to a room that was already occupied. After going back to the registration desk, where we already waited for about 30 minutes to check in, the issue was resolved quickly and we were offered beverage vouchers....",nan,1,ex1671
expedia,valentine weekend in downtown Chicago. Everything within walking distance,nan,1,ex1672
expedia,We had a wonderful stay. The check in was a bit congested when we got there but a nice woman asked if I was a Hilton Honors member and I went straight to the front and they gave me a glass of champaign! They also gave all the people waiting in line a glass. Very nice touch! The beds were a bit small but the room was lovely. Fresh clean white linens on the beds. It would be nice if the parking rate was a bit cheaper. Overall a wonderful stay.,nan,1,ex1673
expedia,Was a Valentines trip with my gf of 5 years and we both loved it!!! Room was clean sheets were fresh and service was great. Nothing greater than being in the heart of downtown. Accessible parking is next door and it was 42$ for overnight parking. good deal for being downtown! overall great stay we will be coming here again.,nan,1,ex1674
expedia,"The hotel and the area was very nice because it was walking distance to many restaurants and the art museum that we were visiting. But I will say for the price, our room was quite small and very tight spaced. There was also what appeared to be a blue smudge marking on the closet door and the bathroom could have been a bit cleaner. But overall, my stay was decent since it was only for one night.",nan,1,ex1675
expedia,We stayed at this hotel for Valentines day. They would not let us check in early so we came back to the hotel around 3 to check with the intentions of checking in and getting ready for dinner reservations that were at 5:30. We waited over an hour to check in and still had to get ready. We ended up almost missing our reservations and all they did was apologizes.,nan,1,ex1676
expedia,"I had a great experience, just the checkin and checkout line was slow due to the lack of more staff. The bar and the restaurant were really nice as well.",nan,1,ex1677
expedia,Very grand and beautiful hotel. Lobby is amazing. Good value and excellent location.,nan,1,ex1678
expedia,"Very cold windy Chicago day, no doormen to be found. We had to search for valet. The hotel is beautiful, fortunately support staff is less than helpful. I would likely stay somewhere else next time.",nan,1,ex1679
expedia,Loved it.,nan,1,ex1680
expedia,This was our second stay at the Palmer House and it was as wonderful as ever. The staff are so exceptional! I travel a great deal and I have never experienced the level of professional staff that I have here.,nan,1,ex1681
expedia,"Rooms are a bit cozy but still maintain a sense of elegance. Despite size, rooms were clean and guest services were great. The lobby's architecture and art is stunning. The lobby/bar is a solid and unique place to enjoy a drink before and after a night in Chicago whether you're staying at the Palmer House or not. Will be going back to check out the restaurants for sure. A true Chicago staple.",nan,1,ex1682
expedia,"Our stay was brief and enjoyable. Rooms are not sound proof, you can hear water running from attached rooms. Service charge for everything.",nan,1,ex1683
expedia,Hotel is beautiful and fancy but the rooms are old and not the cleanest. Customer Service is great. Hotel is for the older crowd.,nan,1,ex1684
expedia,"Overall, I am in the middle of whether I'd stay at the Palmer House again. The room was clean, the neighborhood was close to everything, the room with 1 king size bed was kind of small, but it was comfortable. There were 2 things that I did not like about this hotel. 1) I am in my 20's and obviously look young, I feel as if the staff treated my girlfriend and I different compared to the elder couples. For example, when we were walking through the lobby we felt as if they did not acknowledge us because of our age. This is my biggest pet peeve because I may be young, but I deserve the same respect as every other customer because I am also a PAYING customer.2) We ordered room service and the food made us sick. Don't get me wrong it was delicious, but it definitely did not agree with either one of our stomachs. With the 2 negatives I will say that they gave us a 1 hour late checkout for free, which most hotels charge you for. Also, the pool an hot tub are relaxing! Handicap accessible with a special chair that drops into the water!",nan,1,ex1685
expedia,Had a brief but comfortable stay in Chicago Palmer House. Eating at the hotel was expensive but the food was good. The bellmen were our favorites who went out of their way to treat us like valuable guests.,nan,1,ex1686
expedia,"First weekend trip to Chicago for our Marine son. Met for an action packed weekend if fun. Pleasantly happy to find a beautiful, nastalgic hotel well maintained and located in the heart if the city. Pleasant and accommodating staff, updated room that was clean and beautiful. Couldn't have been mired pleased. We will definitely be back.",nan,1,ex1687
expedia,I have very good time with my family in this hotel The lobby is very nice The only thing I don't like it in the lobby is too much people I can find any sit and the security peoples they watching you all the time if you're standing in the middle but the peoples in the reception and in that restaurant they are Betty nice,nan,1,ex1688
expedia,"Comfortable stay at this wonderful hotel! The lobby is beautiful with all the historic decorations and it looks like a palace. The room we had was a bit small but the king bed and pillows were really comfortable, which was kinda important for us after a whole day walking in February's cold weather. Hotel is very close to the Millennium Park and the Art Institute (about 10 minutes walk), and has a Macy's, a CVS and a lot of places to shop and dine nearby. And even the Skydeck and Magnificent Mile are within walking distance! The were also problems like there were no complimentary bottle water in the hotel if you're not a member, and the in room wifi was surcharged. Although they have free wifi in the lobby but we found the lobby was always crowded and noisy at night.",nan,1,ex1689
expedia,"So glad to finally stay at the Palmer. The lobby is amazing. The rooms are small but very clean and comfortable. Looks like the rooms are due for a renovation as small things like wallpaper coming off the bathroom walls slightly. For the price and location, you can't beat it.",nan,1,ex1690
expedia,"Lovely Valentine's staycation that was busy but not unmanageable. While there were several events at the hotel, the staff was able to keep things moving along. Lots to look at and do nearby (great location), with easy access to the L.",nan,1,ex1691
expedia,Upon arriving the hotel I was very impressed with the appearance and thought I got a great deal for the price I paid. The room was small and the bathroom wAsent even the size of my closet. While there I considered going to the spa with my husband I made reservations but later canceled due to other plans. After checking out of the hotel I discovered an employee at the spa let someone use my information to get an expensive massage and charge it to my credit card !!! I've called several times to get this issue solved but constantly getting the run around. I am still very upset and will never visit this hotel again !,nan,1,ex1692
expedia,"Small room, dirty and uncomfortable. Had breakfast votchure but was not able to use it. Room was $139. Paper thin walls, no privacy. Need updating.",nan,1,ex1693
expedia,If you're looking for some history and nostalgic hotel for Chicago this one has it. It is not a first rate hotel by any means any means what the price was nice. I booked this hotel for me and my wife for Valentines weekend we have stayed here before but it's gone downhill a little bit.,nan,1,ex1694
expedia,Nice hotel .. Good friendly staff .... Rooms are a little smaller than expected...,nan,1,ex1695
expedia,"The hotel was simply gorgeous! Everything was perfect! The restaurant/ bar was great and convenient. The hotel have is a lot of options and opportunities to enjoy ourselves. The staff was nice and made me and my boyfriend feel very comfortable. Room service was everything and so was breakfast the next morning. Check out was so easy being that it was Valentine's Day weekend, I dialed 3 numbers and was checked out less than a minute. I will return in the future.",nan,1,ex1696
expedia,"Hotel was beautiful. Easy check in and out. It was close by Michigan ave, which was a huge plus. I would recommend",nan,1,ex1697
expedia,Great getaway. Wish the room had a refrigerator. The parking was a bit expensive.,nan,1,ex1698
expedia,"I enjoyed staying at the Palmer House. I did have to request to change rooms because the first option I was given there was a lot of youngsters having a great time, but that did not match with me or my needs, so I was changed to a better room with a bit quieter neighbors. What can improve is the information provided to the guests about the Palmer House and its history and of Chicago, on events, tourist info, a map for instance would not hurt. I did not try the restaurants, perhaps if the brownie was invented here, you could include a small brownie as a welcome gift, so one can appreciate the significance of staying in such a location.",nan,1,ex1699
expedia,"we stayed at the Palmer house for a weekend away with plans for a concert at the CSO. the hotel is historic and beautiful!!! it is a thrill to sit in the lobby. our room was comfortable but small. the bed was comfortable but not special. We splurged and had tea which was yummy but not as fancy as I imagined it would be. The breakfest buffet was good and reasonably priced for once. the location of the hotel was PERFECT for downtown activites and shopping. We were able to walk to a concert, so convenient. They did not hype their expensive hotel valet parking and quickly offered a parking structure one block away for half the price of valet. I appreciated that. I would definitely stay here again.",nan,1,ex1700
expedia,"Went to Chicago in business's for three days so fit in one extra day for sightseeing. The concierge Debbie was fabulous!!! We did everything she recommended and she was spot in with every call. We had a quick bite at Rudys did a 2 hr minibus tour which was great, drinks at John Hancock from the 96th floor, the sight was amazing.. Then we had cheeses and wine at the purple pig which was so cool then lastly we went to 3 dots and a dash. Which was a very cool tropical Hawaiian bar in the back alley.. So much fun! The hotel was so spectacular with its historic flair. And close to the L and avenue and eateries . Highly recommend",nan,1,ex1701
expedia,I have stayed here many times and I love it. Great location and rooms are very clean! I will be back soon!,nan,1,ex1702
expedia,Beautiful hotel right inside the loop and near everything,nan,1,ex1703
expedia,"Loved our stay there. We were put into a large room - but it was a wheelchair-ready room so the water flowed freely from the shower into the general bathroom area (since it was built to work with someone taking a wheelchair in). The room also had view of the outside, since it on the 8th floor and came up against the next building - which I felt I could almost touch if I reached out of the window. These were acceptable knocks for an otherwise excellent facility, complete with top rate service and amenities.",nan,1,ex1704
expedia,"This historic grand hotel has been well kept up. Bathroom was showing some age, with a bit of discolored caulking and grout, but overall the room, hallways, and lobby are in great shape. Large, quiet room with easy HVAC controls, good selection of TV channels.",nan,1,ex1705
expedia,This was the second time I stayed here -- very comfortable and friendly staff,nan,1,ex1706
expedia,Very nice staff and the services were excellent.N/a,nan,1,ex1707
expedia,"Have stayed there several times and it is always a pleasant experience. This time one of the bathrooms had a ""funky"" smell to it that was never taken care of. The people at the concierge desk are always there to assist and answer any questions, very patiently. In terms of customer service, I have not been to many hotels that equal the Palmer House.",nan,1,ex1708
expedia,It's been quite a few years since my last stay at the Palmer House and the rooms are greatly improved. The bed was comfortable and the shower great. Our window was open when we arrived and it was freezing. But it quickly warmed once I shut it. The elevator was frustrating as only certain ones go to the higher floors and it could take a long time to get one that wasn't already crammed full. I wish that they had chosen to put guests on the same floor as the ones that were a part of the high school convention going on. Was kept awake til well after midnight due to slamming doors and giggling girls.,nan,1,ex1709
expedia,"Front desk staff were outstanding, concierge also, extremely helpful.",nan,1,ex1710
expedia,"This historic hotel is beautiful. The staff is incredibly helpful and top notch. The rooms were large and the bedding was comfortable. We stayed during college unifieds, so there was some noise when students would sing in their rooms & in the halls. The location is perfect for downtown Chicago with parking nearby.",nan,1,ex1711
expedia,Lovely old hotel that overall they've done a wonderful job keeping it up. However the bathroom had little counter space and the shower drained poorly which is the only reason for a less than perfect rating.,nan,1,ex1712
expedia,Overall -- it was good! Room was very clean and friendly staff,nan,1,ex1713
expedia,The hotel is a historic classic located between the business district and great dining. The facilities are modern yet 1920's looking. Good gym although I'd like more stretching area. Most rooms are comfortable although every now and then I get a tiny one. Overall my go-to hotel in Chicago.,nan,1,ex1714
expedia,Came to the Palmer House for unified auditions. The service at the door and at the check-in desk were excellent. Executive level room and amenities made our stay comfortable and stress free. I did find the restaurants to be pricey. Would suggest a more casual dining option within the hotel.,nan,1,ex1715
expedia,Unique historic hotel with a lobby bar in a great setting,nan,1,ex1716
expedia,"Lobby is beautiful, room was clean, rates were reasonable. Great location and there is a Starbucks right on the ground floor. Hotel employees were friendly and accommodating. Requested a humidifier. One was brought to the room immediately and I was even told that they would come back periodically and fill it up if I didn't want to do it!",nan,1,ex1717
expedia,"I love staying in the Palmer House! It was very quiet (blizzard over the weekend), but everyone on staff was friendly and helpful. I'll be back....",nan,1,ex1718
expedia,"The rooms were very neat and clean however they lacked the necessities. I was surprised to see that the hotel did not provide disposable toothbrushes and there was only one bar of soap for handwashing and body washing. The hotel was severely understaffed due to a storm which I understood. However breakfast took two hours, no exaggeration, and the employee taking the order seemed slightly annoyed. They did however call to let me know that the wait was going to be longer than they first quoted me (which was an hour). Dinner service was backed up as well, but the food was great and the manager was very apologetic about the inconvience. The swimming area and hot tub were fantastic, very well maintained. The staff throughout the stay didn't speak or smile much. Overall it wasn't a terrible night. Things happen. I will be back this month and hopefully things run smoothly.",nan,1,ex1719
expedia,"This is a great looking hotel with a fabulous lobby and very good staff. But there is pathetic nickle and diming going on by the Hilton--extra charge for internet, a charge for checking in early (11:00 am) even when lots of rooms are available. Great hotels don't do this. Still I would recommend staying there for its old-style grandeur.",nan,1,ex1720
expedia,favorite spot in Chicago,nan,1,ex1721
expedia,"other than the bathroom being very small, our stay was perfect. excellent location,great lobby and gathering place for hanging out during long waits, large, elegant room, beautiful sheets. starbucks in hotel and freshii, while not perfect, tries and keeps up with healthy appetites. valet and bell captains get gold stars.",nan,1,ex1722
expedia,It was very luxurious feeling and the staff definitley was willing to help. But the phone calls from the room cost a 1.50 each and the WiFi cost money as well.,nan,1,ex1723
expedia,"Loved the hotel and all the amenities like pool, hot tub access..etc! I booked the room with 2bathrooms which was nice so everyone could get ready but room wasn't as glamorous as I thought it would be. The lobby area and bar were beautiful. We ate at the restaurant Potters which had overpriced food that was awful! I would stay at this hotel if I would get a great discount again I wouldn't pay over $200 a night.",nan,1,ex1724

expedia,"I called ahead to ask if the front desk could please pull aside a toiletry item I forgot to pack, knowing I'd be getting in after midnight and would want to get right to bed. They took my name said they would have it waiting for me. I checked in, and the item wasn't pulled aside. The front agent told me that they were out of them at the desk and I should have called ahead, and now I'd have to wait for housekeeping to get one, which would be a 20 minute wait. I *did* call ahead... These little things can make a difference in a stay. Also, the room was not very clean. There were other peoples' stray hairs everywhere.",nan,1,ex1726
expedia,"typically saw 10-15 people waiting for elevators on a given floor. They are archaic. 3-4 elevators solely servicing 8 floors leading to long wait times which is a pain when trying to go to work in the morning. However, at least they were working 3 out of the 4 nights. The walk down the stairs from the 18th floor was not fun on one of the nights.",nan,1,ex1727

expedia,Great Location!!! Nice rooms!,nan,1,ex1729
expedia,"I always love staying at the Palmer House. It's an historic building so of course you don't get ALL the luxuries of a new hotel, but the ongoing upkeep and maintenance is evident. The only thing you really miss out on is size. The rooms are smaller than most newer hotels, but I love it here.",nan,1,ex1730

expedia,"Great hotel, Loads of character, centrally located, helpful staff. It was better than I had expected from looking at the website, would recommend it and consider staying there again. Was there for the ASHRAE conference so hotel was fully occupied for first part of stay, so lifts were busy, but after the conference no problems at all",nan,1,ex1735
expedia,The bathroom was tight. You could not close the door unless to straddled the toilet. Also they did not offer complementary coffee or tea in the room or even offered water in the room for a fee. You had to go all the way to the lobby to the gift store to purchase the water. Not even the vending machines on the floor offered water...,nan,1,ex1736
expedia,I enjoyed my stay. However the only issue i had was that the drawers in the room were not cleaned out as there was old food and cigarettes.,nan,1,ex1737
expedia,"Great service, a true testament to old school Chicago architecture and design. Super friendly staff and conveniently located.",nan,1,ex1738
expedia,"The hotel was great, however there was a lack of cleanliness. When we entered our room, there was a clump of hair on the dresser. I believe the previous girl who stayed in the room forgot her extensions. Other than we had a comfortable stay. My friends and I stayed there to celebrate my 28th Birthday.",nan,1,ex1739
expedia,"This historic hotel is gorgeous! If more than one person is staying in a room, you may find the bathroom to be uncomfortably small. It's a large hotel and can seem confusing at times, especially because of the offset levels between the conference area and hotel area. We come here frequently so we've got the layout down, but for a first-timer it can be frustrating.",nan,1,ex1740
expedia,"Massive hotel with plenty to do on the premises and in the immediate area. Room was nice, but the pool area was quite chilly. Decor was amazing because of the holiday season and the staff was nice, accommodating, and on point when I needed them.",nan,1,ex1741
expedia,"Beautiful, historic hotel, great area, friendly and efficient staff. Highly recommend!",nan,1,ex1742

expedia,"Beautiful first impression, gorgeous hotel and fantastic atmosphere but quality of rooms do not mirror the essence of the hotel. The morning time was loud, as expected per other guests checking out, but housekeeping was knocking on my door at 9:30 am when checkout was at 11.",nan,1,ex1744
expedia,"Overall, we had a great experience. We were put in a ""handicapped"" room, without requesting or needing it, and that meant we had a walk-in shower, but no bathtub. On the plus side, there was an enormous walk-in closet that made luggage storage easy.",nan,1,ex1745
expedia,"We stayed at the Palmer House, and it was a very nice experience. The lobby is beautiful and awe-inspiring. The hot tub could use a little updating, but otherwise the hotel is a beautiful and comfortable place to stay.",nan,1,ex1746
expedia,"We had a great time at this hotel. The room was spacious and very clean. The hotel location was right in the middle of the Loop so we walked to almost every ""must"" see landmark. My only dislike about our room was that you could hear anyone walking down the hallway or in the rooms next door, not much sound proof.",nan,1,ex1747
expedia,"The soul of a great hotel. Location is tremendous to the L, attractions, food and entertainment. The facilities are beautiful and efficient from the elevators and business center to the bar. I look forward to my next visit.",nan,1,ex1748
expedia,"Great and historic hotel with modern amenities in a very good location. It's right next to the L, very convenient, but if you think the noise will annoy you, you may want to request a room on the higher floors. From up there the train sounds like a central ac unit coming on and off. Beautiful place!",nan,1,ex1749
expedia,"It was great! We do not usually stay in hotels quite that fancy so it was hard to figure out who to tip and how much to tip. Aside from that the hotel was beautiful and the staff was very accommodating! If I ever get back to Chicago, I would stay here again!!!!",nan,1,ex1750
expedia,"the hotel is old. you could see theres an attempt to modernize the room that we got but still old. there was no view from our window (another wall of a bldg, i guess). i wish there were choices such as a city view or something like that. the room that we got doesnt have a lot of room to put our toiletries. it's just the sink and small area to put our toothbrushes. no coffee maker in the room. the beds are comfy, though. no list of channels in the room so we had to change t he channels to see which one was it. the room was reserved for 4 people, but the towels that were there were only 3.",nan,1,ex1751

I was given my room key and told that I would receive a text in about 1hrs with room number when it was ready. We decided to go shopping on State Street, 2 1/2 hrs later, I realized that I hadn't received a text. I went back to registration desk and 20 minutes later, they finally decided to assign another room. I had spa services scheduled at Balance Spa and Salon. This was the only portion of my stay that was worth every dime spent. The staff was friendly and professional. My masseuse, Shalawn gave the best Swedish massage. My manicurist did an great job. Because of the delay in room assignment, I didn't notice the condition of the room until I returned from my spa services. The walls were.dirty, the furniture was old and raggedy, with scratches. The furniture could be called eclectic, but really it was just tacky. The color scheme was Brown, purple, green and beige.UGH. The second bathroom had mildew in the shower. My bed had springs. I was too relaxed and exhausted to deal with changing rooms. I really should have. My best friend insisted that we order room service because we didn't have the energy to leave the room or get dressed, etc The food from room service.....gross. The food was supposed to be from the hotels restaurant called Lockwood. The short ribs were dried out and old. Steamed vegetables had to be microwaved.",nan,1,ex1753

When I was informed at work that I would be spending 5 days in Chicago I took the opportunity to book this historic hotel. The Palmer House met all the expectations that I had set for it from the time I walked in until I checked out. Walking into the hotel for the first time is nothing short of amazing. The people at the front desk were helpful and very nice to work with. I stayed on the 17th floor ""which does not have the larger rooms"". The room was very clean and tidy. It was a very small room which I expected from reading about the hotel. The only thing I would have changed about the stay is that the bathroom is small, I mean tiny small. However that would not deter me from staying here again. The restaurant downstairs was good as well. Overall a great stay in a great city.",nan,1,ex1755
expedia,Excellent! I'll recommend it!,nan,1,ex1756
expedia,"Despite arranged check-in for my wife days in advance, she had to wait for me to leave the convention to get her into our room. When unpacking clothes, she discovered men's dirty underwear in the top drawer of the dresser. This really didn't start well and overall our stay was disappointing. Day 2 there were no new bath towels and I simply won't stay at this hotel again. Despite it's long heritage, employees in lobby and street level very unprofessional and I very much wish that I had selected almost anywhere but Palmer House.",nan,1,ex1757
expedia,Great room. Awesome hotel. Will stay again,nan,1,ex1758
expedia,"Everything was great except the main entrance door to the room had 1"" opening on the bottom and we could hear everybody walking in the hallway.",nan,1,ex1759
expedia,Great location and beautiful hotel with lots of charm. We come stay in the city at least once a month and the Palmer House is one that we will definitely come back to soon.,nan,1,ex1760
expedia,"Would definitely stay here again. Beautiful hotel.. Maybe a little ""old"" for some but I think that gives it charm!! Had a problem the first night with a bachelor party going on in the room next to us, manager had us moved in less than 10 minutes! Service was outstanding! Cleaning people could do better (hair in soap dish of shower-not from someone's head either!) beds were ok. Loved the tablet in the room! Nice touch",nan,1,ex1761
expedia,We took an over night stay in the city to spend a few days at the museum.,nan,1,ex1762

expedia,"Checking in and out was a breeze. Room was comfortable. I left a brief case in my room and was able to retrieve it easily. Lobby, as always, beautiful and lively.",nan,1,ex1764
expedia,"Perfect location to stay in downtown Chicago, only 10 minute cab ride to great restaurants and activities. The hotel itself is a hidden gem with great decor and photos of stars from the past. The lounge is a great place to relax and enjoy the surrounding architecture.",nan,1,ex1765
expedia,"The stay was very nice, had a great time. Plus you can't beat the location!",nan,1,ex1766
expedia,Perfect for business or pleasure,nan,1,ex1767
expedia,"I'd give the Palmer House a 3.75 out of 5 if I could. Historic building with a beautiful lobby, the Palmer House comes up just short of living up to its potential. Being a very large hotel means there is a lack of attentiveness from the staff. While clean and spacious, our room was strangely and uncomfortably laid out, and the bathroom was far too small. Location and price are hard to beat, and would stay there again based on those alone.",nan,1,ex1768
expedia,Love the vibe of this hotel. Potter's was closed so had to eat in lobby area serviced by Lockwood. Server was pretty slow and low energy. The good was fantastic! Ate the Buffet breakfast the next morning and it was very good! The room was a nice size. Beds are only doubles (prefer queen size if two sharing). Love the comforters! We had a 2 bath. One bath was super tiny. Door had to be carved out to fit around the toilet bowl when shutting the door. 2 nd bath was nice size but dirty (hair on floor). Pool is really small and not the nicest but ok,nan,1,ex1769
expedia,Beautiful hotel. Great location. Easy to get to everything and the concierge is very helpful.,nan,1,ex1770
expedia,The hotel is beautiful. The staff was friendly. The location was perfect. We have stayed there twice. The only thing I wish they had was free wifi.,nan,1,ex1771
expedia,"I booked our weekend getaway for my bf's birthday. I had called ahead to have a wine bottle and strawberries in the room before arrival. When I checked in I asked if the room was set up like I had asked. The front desk made a call to room service to find out that it was not set up. The request was put in immediately, however it dragged to get to the room. The 'wow' moment was not there when I opened the door. So I was disappointed with that aspect.",nan,1,ex1772
expedia,Beautiful hotel and great location. At checkin ask people about validating parking.,nan,1,ex1773
expedia,"Great hotel for a weekend getaway. This will be our go-to hotel for stays in downtown Chicago. A block from the Art Institute of Chicago and walkable to most of the sights. Public spaces are spectacular. The rooms tend to be a little odd due to restrictions on renovating this historic building, but the location cannot be beat. Great desk staff and special package rates make this a gem.",nan,1,ex1774
expedia,"We had a great time, the hotel is beautiful!",nan,1,ex1775

expedia,"we really liked our stay at the Palmer House which is actually one of the sights in Chicago (especially because of its marvelous lobby that also houses a great bar the location is just perfect if you want to explore the city after we got a free upgrade, our room was really nice, the original one a little depressing though as are the corridors - none of the rooms feature a great view however given the standard of the rest of the hotel and especially the appearance of the lobby where it was taking place, the breakfast wasn't all that great but still okay for the price in summary: thumbs up",nan,1,ex1783
expedia,All I can is wow. What a hotel and what a experience and the best part is the location. The hotel itself is absolutely amazing. The meeting rooms are from a long ago era. If going to Chicago consider it!,nan,1,ex1784

expedia,"Amazing hotel, great staff, very reasonable price for the Loop.",nan,1,ex1795
expedia,My husband and I went to Chicago for the the weekend to see Chicago Bulls. The hotel staff gave us a list of nearby resturants to choose from in the area. Since we decieded to explore the area. Starbucks was downstairs so we had great coffee. Our room was clean and the bathrrom was stocked. I would definitely go back to Palmer House.,nan,1,ex1796
expedia,Service was entirely helpful and pleasant . I was greeted courteously by everyone and assisted. The check-in was extremely speedy and I was impressed by the desk clerk's patience when I gave her the wrong card.,nan,1,ex1797

expedia,"After staying here for a night with my boyfriend, we accidentally left a piece of expensive jewelry in the room after checking out. After communicating with security they developed some crazy story about how the watch was mysteriously not in the room. The manager was no help, he told me he didn't have time to talk to me or help me and denied my request to investigate the issue further. I requested a call back from a different manager and never got it. I will never support this business again.",nan,1,ex1801
expedia,the hotel itself was a very wonderful experience it was very beautiful definitely would go back to the hotel the only real problem I had was the walls in the rooms were pretty as in I could be laying on the bed and I could hear the people next door opening a can of soda little uneasy because it was a huge family and they were up till midnight but other than that it was a good experience,nan,1,ex1802
expedia,Great staff! Super friendly! Love the Judy Garland posters in the hotel halls. Thanks!,nan,1,ex1803

expedia,"Great location. Well run hotel. unexpected cons with my room: no microwave, no fridge, no free wifi unless you go to the lobby. But a fair price for the high standard of the hotel and the location.",nan,1,ex1806
expedia,"I'm a frequent traveler I use Hilton establishments quite often, The Palmer Hilton was not up to my expectations. My stay at other Hilton establishments set a high bar. Slow and no room services Had to pay for servives that other Hiltons give free. paying for extra amenities Very expensive. difficulty in finding parking.",nan,1,ex1807
expedia,"My wife and I were there Dec. 11th for our anniversary, before we checked in we went to the Academic club and to see a performance at the symphony. We checked in and the staff were friendly. The parking was nearby in the Monroe garage, and it was straight forward. The only drawback is that we didn't get a Continental breakfast with our deal and you had to pay for WiFi. But we will definitely consider returning. It's really a terrific and historic place.",nan,1,ex1808
expedia,"While the rooms are small, they clean and quiet. The lobby is a beautiful place for a gathering. Parking is a little expensive, but understandable for the location downtown. Overall great stay.",nan,1,ex1809
expedia,"Stayed on a new years eve with family and because of policies they explained to every client during check in, we had a very quite stay that we could sleep in the middle of the night. Though very busy, it was a fun place to stay and our room was very clean",nan,1,ex1810
expedia,"The hotel is definitely old glam style. It's at great location and everything is almost readily available near by. the stay would have been great if it wasn't for the following: * wifi cost 10 per night. i've been to countless hotels and never had to paid additional for it. it's a necessity these days for people and not exactly a perk that should be paid for. * room cleaning service. woke me up at 8:30 to clean room because i didnt put up the do not disturb sign. i was planning on getting up at 9 and didn't think any hotels clean that early. Following day when i do put up the sign, i could hear the surrounding rooms getting cleaned and got woken up anyways. 2 bad nights of sleep.",nan,1,ex1811
expedia,"Everything was great, beautiful hotel and friendly staff. I wish WiFi was included in the price of the room instead of a separate charge.",nan,1,ex1812
expedia,very relaxing and everyone that worked here was very polite. I didn't know about the $50 deposit or the $41 dollar charge a night for my car in their garage but other than those unexpected charges it was nice.,nan,1,ex1813
expedia,"Spent two nights. Location was perfect for visiting Millenium Park and the new Maggie Daly Park (the wait to rent ice skates was over 2 hrs long. Best to bring your own.) Also, perfect for visiting the Art Institute of Chicago, a most amazing museum. 5+ hrs barely touched the opportunities. Concierge desk was very helpful in providing info for buses to the north of the river Michigan Ave and Navy Pier area. Good price for room; had everything we needed since we were mostly sleeping there until the next day's activities.",nan,1,ex1814
expedia,Beautiful historic hotel walking distance to Millenium Park and Art Institute. We did have an issue with the cleanliness of our first room but were moved to another room with no problems. The foyer is stunning and staff very friendly and helpful. Would recommend staying here.,nan,1,ex1815
expedia,"While our general experience was very good, room comfortable and the staff very helpful, the Lockwood was understaffed on New Years day in the afternoon and it took an hour for us to get food. Food lacked a range of choices and was overpriced. Fortunately there are many fine and more reasonable restaurants in the area. The hot tub in the pool area is in serious need of a makeover, bordered on disgusting. Still it is a beautiful historic building, and a fun place to stay",nan,1,ex1816
expedia,"Beautiful, well appointed hotel. Staff was wonderful. My only negative comment is that I did not like the pillows!",nan,1,ex1817
expedia,Could not believe that microwave and refrigerator cost money. We had to go eat for every meal. Otherwise nice hotel.,nan,1,ex1818
expedia,Definitely staying here again!!! The NYE party was amazing!,nan,1,ex1819
expedia,You get everything you can expect from the Palmer House. Perfect location for exploring the city. We stayed in an executive room which was big and comfy. The complimentary breakfast wasn't the best hotel breakfast we've had but there is a lot of places close by where you can get something to eat in the morning. Would definitely recommend this hotel and we will be back during our next visit to Chicago.,nan,1,ex1820
expedia,I have stayed here many times and I love the hotel. The rooms are a little small.,nan,1,ex1821
expedia,Overall hotel was fine but room was small and bathroom small with an awkward layout.,nan,1,ex1822
expedia,"Great Location, walkable from Union Station and yet only blocks from the night life. The staff was friendly. The walls are a little thin, heard a lot of hall activity but all in all worth the price we paid!",nan,1,ex1823
expedia,"Great hotel, it was under construction remodel. but that is what I like about this hotel chain, they always make improvements to their hotels. Staff was very professional and polite.",nan,1,ex1824
expedia,"This hotel was great! All the staff was friendly and so helpful!! The room was very tiny but it was very nice. The toilet did flood and it may have been due to all the construction since when we called the staff to fix it, it sounded like it was something that had been happening quite a bit. They did fix it right away so it wasnt a bad experience. Over all I really liked this hotel.",nan,1,ex1825
expedia,"Great hotel if you're looking for a place in the theatre district! The riverfront and lakefront are a fairly short walk. My king room was a tad on the small side, but I was traveling alone so it wasn't a big deal.",nan,1,ex1826
expedia,"I was extremely disappointed with my stay at Hotel Allegro. All the reviews I read were completed wrong. The best part about my stay was the fact that there was a Starbucks in the lobby. Otherwise, everything sucked. The room was the size of a shoe box. The closet and bathroom were even smaller. There was no place to get ready in the bathroom because there was absolutely not space to stand between the toilet bowl, tub and sink counter. Our drain was clogged in our bathtub and the tv didn't work properly. Not to mention, the electrician who came to fix our television said, ""Oh they must have just thrown this room together because it wasn't even a room as of recently."" The hotel staff did nothing to make our stay more enjoyable. I complained twice and they could only offer me a room upgrade with the same size bathroom for $60 more dollars a night. There was also a very funky smell. The hotel tried to squeeze way too many rooms on one floor and the result was an extremely uncomfortable closet to live in for the weekend. We were thoroughly disappointed and we will never go back.",nan,1,ex1827
expedia,"The hotel is extremely clean. The rooms are a little small. The staff are very friendly and helpful. I would stay here again. Close to shopping, for sightseeing and is located in Chicago's theater district. Excellent hotel.",nan,1,ex1828
expedia,"We had a room 622 that was essentially in the elevator lobby. (Apparently all of the floors have this issue- ) they moved us the next night but didn't have any more rooms to move us to the first night. We got 808 and was very quite. Hotel getting a check-in reception area remodel so this review is not based on the temporary check in area. Art Deco in rooms very nice although the rooms are small. I had to shimmy around my husband to get to the bathroom. King sized bed plus a small table. Bath room - if sitting on toilet can start water in the shower and in the sink from same sitting position. Very clean. Location excellent and walked everywhere. Lunch places close by only open M-F. When booked through Expedia you can't get Kimpton reward ""Karma"" points and you get labeled ""pre-pay"" so it's possible that's why we got the rooms we did. Price was right and bed was exceptionally comfortable. Would stay there again but bring earplugs just in case.",nan,1,ex1829
expedia,great location excellent location close to trains and near tons of restaurants,nan,1,ex1830
expedia,Room and bathroom were very small. Not large enough for more than one person. Double bed instead of King bed. Decor recently updated but is very unattractive. Parking is valet only for $59 per night. Staff was great. Location of hotel is very good. Only stayed for one night which was long enough because of room size,nan,1,ex1831
expedia,The staff was extremely friendly and quick with any requests. The coffee and wine service provided by the hotel makes your visit even more pleasant.,nan,1,ex1832
expedia,Staff was very pleasant and helpful with accurate directions to the areas I was interested in going.,nan,1,ex1833
expedia,"This place will be super after the ongoing renovation is complete. For now, it's solid, but the rooms are small and a bit dark. I could have used more elbow room to work, and in the bathroom. The location is outstanding- walking distance to all main business centers, tourist attractions and theaters. Great restaurants and bars all around.",nan,1,ex1834
expedia,"Spent theree days in Chicago. Arrived five hours late due to snow, feeling a bit frazzled. The staff were so welcoming and reassuring - 'would you like a glass of wine?' Room large and comfortable, very clean and well looked after. Same with bathroom Teas/coffees were available in the foyer every morning and a wine hour between 5 & 6. Nice to meet other guests and pass the time with them",nan,1,ex1835
expedia,"Staff were helpful, knowledgeable about the city and places to go. The room could have been a little larger. There was a wet room which I personally did not like as the whole bathroom seemed to get flooded and it took a while for the water to drain away. The situation of the hotel was ideal for us as it was convenient for Magnificent Mile and Theatre District. My two daughters ran in the Shamrock Shuffle 8K race and the hotel was on the route so I had a great vantage point right outside the hotel. Only one downside was that the hotel was being renovated and access to some areas was not possible. We hadn't been told about this beforehand.",nan,1,ex1836
expedia,Hotel is every nice. It was under construction during my stay. It did not affect my room or comfort.,nan,1,ex1837
expedia,The staff was above and beyond accommodating and friendly! The room was gorgeous and it was smack in the middle of everything. I would definitely stay there again!!,nan,1,ex1838
expedia,"We didn't know that the hotel was undergoing renovation so things were a little disorganized. We were put in an elevator shaft room initially, and the inroom fridge was unplugged,but the kind support staff put us in a nicer room once we asked - even though it was close to 1 am.",nan,1,ex1839
expedia,"Only stayed for two nights so this was a great option. The room was spacious and clean. I like the amenities offered. My only gripe was waking up to construction noise on a Saturday, but read the reviews ahead of time about this possibility and there was a nice note from the hotel manager about it in the room upon entering.",nan,1,ex1840
expedia,"Hotel is currently undergoing a remodel. It's fully functional and there was no problems with noise, dust, etc. The staff is great! Very prompt and helpful. We were on the 14th floor and the area has been updated. The room was nice an big but we would have liked to have some drawers for unpacking. There were two very small drawers in the entertainment center. It also contained a room safe and a snack bar (we think. we never had the key to open it). The bathroom is very small and there really is no 'flat space' to use for cosmetics, shaving gear, etc. The new decor, while very new and clean, is not our style. It's rather dark and, to me, had a 1960's vibe. The location is great for the theater district, right next to the Cadalac Theater. There are a few nearby restaurants but most of the landmark places are a mile or so away. I'm sure you'll be happy if you stay here.",nan,1,ex1841
expedia,"I love this hotel chain for just about every reason...from the rooms, to the people, to the networking and wine events, they are pet friend and very social and ecologically conscious and very Philanthropic.",nan,1,ex1842
expedia,I can't wait to go back!! I went to get away and relax and this hotel did not disappoint. One of my favorite things was that every room had a yoga mat. There was also a yoga channel. In the morning I enjoyed organic tea in the lobby. This hotel was right up my alley!,nan,1,ex1843
expedia,very good location but currently work in progress that prevent breakfast for instance.,nan,1,ex1844

expedia,Nice place. Funky as expected. Extremely small but efficient bathroom.,nan,1,ex1847
expedia,"The rooms were small but had all that you needed. The staff was nothing short of awesome - friendly, courteous and very helpful. For that alone, I would come back even though the hotel had minor inconveniences with the construction for the remodeling. Once that is complete, I am sure it would be excellent.",nan,1,ex1848
expedia,Room was small but served its purpose. Overall a nice place to stay,nan,1,ex1849
expedia,"needed a place to crash so as not to drive home after the night out, at the price we paid, the Allegro filled the bill.",nan,1,ex1850
expedia,We went to Chicago for the 1st time ever this weekend and you better believe we WILL be back! This hotel is fit for a true Chicago experience!,nan,1,ex1851
expedia,Excellent LOCATION Nice educated staff Room impeccable,nan,1,ex1852
expedia,Staff was not very helpful. Front desk staff promised to call us when our room was ready and never did. We left our bags with the bell captain and were disappointed that they were not delivered to our room when it was finally ready. The front desk referred us to a restaurant that we walked too only to discover that it was not open on Saturdays. They are doing some remodeling and would like to see the completed project.,nan,1,ex1853
expedia,"Have to admit I was a bit disappointed with Allegro, having had fantastic stays at other Kimpton hotels. Room was very small. Beyond the bed, there was no other furniture to lounge on. Bathroom was beyond tiny. Everything was clean, but just not the experience I was looking for when I book a Kimpton hotel.",nan,1,ex1854
expedia,"The hotel staff was very friendly and helpful, but the hotel itself had NO amenities...no soda machines, no coffee (other than a few hours in the morning, no snacks, nothing! The staff directed us to a local 7-11 around the corner. Also, would not recommend staying here on the weekend as the hotel is located in the Financial area of town and EVERYTHING around it (except the 7-11, thank goodness) closes by 10:00pm.",nan,1,ex1855
expedia,This was a nice hotel to stay in and overall I give it a thumbs up,nan,1,ex1856
expedia,"I wish I had known about the extent of the renovations going on before I booked at the Allegro. I have stayed there several times before and liked the ambiance. This time, the lobby was inaccessible, the evening wine reception was in a little nook on the ground floor, and the room itself seemed sterile and cold. (I don't know if the room had been recently renovated or not.) The only bright spot was the employees. All were very helpful and very friendly. I'm glad I was just there overnight.",nan,1,ex1857
expedia,"Great location for business meeting, walk to office",nan,1,ex1858
expedia,"Very nice, typical Kimpton--good service, fun part of town (next to a theater). It's under renovation, but even that made little difference.",nan,1,ex1859
expedia,Last minute needed a hotel because of flight delay. The place will be nice when construction is done. Staff were great.,nan,1,ex1860
expedia,Will come back again.,nan,1,ex1861
expedia,"This hotel is old. I thought we had a King bed but it ended up being a double. The room is small and so is the bathroom. There are no vending machines so when we got back to the hotel at 10pm we could not get anything to drink - water, pop etc. The restaurant across the street was closed. Don't look for any amenities here.",nan,1,ex1862
expedia,The hotel is in a sleepy part of the Loop at night/ weekends. Gym was under construction so had to walk 6 blocks to la fitness. Room is small and awkward bathroom barn doors make getting ready an extra challenge. Hotel just feels old and in need of some spunk.,nan,1,ex1863
expedia,Nice interior and friendly environment. The hotel keeps your room clean and neat everyday.,nan,1,ex1864
expedia,"Disappointed that the gym was closed for renovations, since the LT fitness was 5 blocks away (and it was cold!). Hopefully the renovated gym will be worth it. Also, the adjacent restaurant was closed on Mondays, and the one downstairs has disappeared, leaving the hotel with no adjoining restaurant on Mondays, which is odd. All in all, still a good hotel, but this particular visit was a bit disappointing.",nan,1,ex1865
expedia,Great place and fantastic staff. Somewhat like a boutique hotel but very nice.,nan,1,ex1866
expedia,Pleasant and comfortable. Staff always eager to help.,nan,1,ex1867
expedia,"Stayed with my husband for 6 nights during New Year holidays. I liked the hotel. Pros are: location, hotel and room design, gym and 5 o'clock free alcohol drinks in the lobby. Cons: the room was a little too small although very cozy, on the first of Jan one could wait for an elevator for like 10 minutes - way too busy when the hotel is fully booked. In general the stay was very nice. The location of the hotel is just great - very convenient, close to everything in the Loop. Their vallet parking is overpriced and makes no sense to use, there are at least 3 self-parking facilities around with a price 30% less.",nan,1,ex1868

expedia,"I loved the architecture and style of this gorgeous hotel! It had a very relaxing, yet chic, vibe (especially during their daily complimentary wine tasting). Sure, the sophisticated amosphere really did blow me away, but my positive rating isn't based solely on looks. The staff was very accommodating, friendly, and full of restaurant recommendations. Everything I noticed seemed clean and I'm working order. In general the hotel is in a great location. It's by several CTA train stops and cabs are plentiful given it's in theatre district. My only complaints are that the walls were a bit too thin (we had noisy neighbors, if you know what I mean) and that the queen size bedroom was a bit small, but for it's relatively low price I would say that what the rest of the hotel had to offer made it worth it.",nan,1,ex1878

expedia,"Nice place to stay. Good location. Clean, organized and provided good service.",nan,1,ex1881
expedia,"The hotel staff was fantastic. Probably some of the nicest I've ever come across. The hotel had a ""hangover station"" and offered free cold pizza and coffee in the morning in celebration of New Years Eve. The hotel lobby was also very nice and cozy. The room was a bit small, but it had a nice T.V. and comfortable bed. The biggest downside came mostly from the fact that it was New Years Eve. There was a party down the hall with a very large number of people that eventually was broken up. Also, the couple staying in the room next to ours was really, REALLY enjoying their stay. Though, I think the female must have stubbed her toes quite a few times because there was a lot of thumping and screaming.",nan,1,ex1882
expedia,Security couldn't take care of a noisy person for 2 and half hours at 3 am in the morning.,nan,1,ex1883
expedia,Had a really good time the hotel staff were really nice people and they have a lot of complimentary items if you forget them at home such as a flat iron! No charge to you. Loved my stay will definitely go back,nan,1,ex1884
expedia,The morning cold pizza was a great idea for New Year Day.,nan,1,ex1885
expedia,I love it,nan,1,ex1886
expedia,"We traveled with a 4 year old and this hotel was perfect. Hot chocolate bar at 2 pm and space for all 3 of us in the room. Excellent customer service, beautiful lobby. We love Kimpton hotels.",nan,1,ex1887
expedia,My 2 daughters and I enjoyed our stay at Hotel Allegro for the following reasons: All staff that we had contact with were very professional. The location was ideal for our plans of shopping and sightseeing. The beds were very comfortable. The lobby area had a wonderful smell like a floral shop as you came off the elevator.,nan,1,ex1888
expedia,"I stay here often when in Chicago. As always, a good experience.",nan,1,ex1889
expedia,We love staying here. So close to parking. So close to the theatre. So close to shopping. The staff is always prompt and polite. Great place to stay.,nan,1,ex1890
expedia,Stayed at the Allegro this past long weekend. Took a couple of tries to get the room layout we liked but the front desk staff was very patient and accommodating. We were on the 14th floor overlooking Randolph and were never bothered by train noise or any other noise for that matter. The room was very clean and functional. Totally served our needs for an empty-nesters getaway. We would definitely stay here again,nan,1,ex1891
expedia,"Great location. Nice Staff that are very responsive. No room service as they do not have restaurant facilities. You have to ask for a coffee server for the room. However, it is complimentary and they brought me a Kurig with all the add-ons. Hotel is old, but has been modernized into a boutique hotel.",nan,1,ex1892
expedia,"Met a friend here to attend a Christmas party without having to drive home. The room was spotless, good use of a smaller space, exceptionally quiet for being in the heart of Chicago. Got a great price for a Saturday night. Would certainly come again.",nan,1,ex1893
expedia,"I appreciated the complimentary wine bar but would have been much happier with free internet. And the parking charges took the joy out of the deal I got on the room. On the positive side, the staff was amazingly friendly and helpful. And the location was awesome!",nan,1,ex1894
expedia,We stay at the Kimpton Hotels in Chicago a few times a year--love the holiday atmosphere and the 312 Restaurant!,nan,1,ex1895
expedia,It was nice. Room a little small,nan,1,ex1896
expedia,"Like all Kimpton properties, this one is top shelf. Great location, beautiful room, friendly staff and a reasonable price.",nan,1,ex1897
expedia,I'm seriously picky about cleanliness of bathtub. Soap film on bottom is the reason I docked it a point. Nothing gross or yucky in the room.,nan,1,ex1898
expedia,"Cozy, trendy. Great hospitality!",nan,1,ex1899
expedia,"Very straight forward, regular hotel stay. Decor was interesting, didn't match the old ""historic"" feel I was wanting to see. But resonably priced and bice location.",nan,1,ex1900
expedia,"Great location and price for a quick get away to Chicago. The room is a bit small, as is the bathroom, but we didn't spend much time there anyway. Comfortable bed",nan,1,ex1901
expedia,This hotel is in a perfect location. Friendly staff and clean rooms. Would stay here again.,nan,1,ex1902
expedia,"This hotel is within walking distance from the train station, Macy's on State, the Christkindlmarket, and Michigan Avenue. The service was prompt and we enjoyed the festive wine social hour, and the rooms were clean but small. Great place and would stay there again.",nan,1,ex1903
expedia,I had a great stay with the staff ensuring all was well looked after. I was pleasantly surprised that my room was available for early checkin when I arrived downtown. Very quick access to the L and all the shopping on State St.,nan,1,ex1904
expedia,"Very cool hotel in the theatre district of Chicago. The rooms are slightly smaller than usual, however given the hotel being older this is to be excepted. The lobby and common areas of the hotel are decorated with a modern yet classic look. I would recommend this hotel to anyone looking for a deal in Chicago.",nan,1,ex1905
expedia,"This hotel is a block away from the train station. We took the train from the airport. $6 on Friday and $3 to return on Sunday. The hotel was in the older theatre section of town but it was quaint. Clean and friendly. Yes the rooms were a little small, but we were barely there. We walked and walked the town. The room were on the small side but that is what a older building would be. It was clean and comfy. Staff at front desk were very helpful and enjoying the happy hour at 5 was a nice touch. We could easily walk to State street where Macy's and other ""normal stores were. And yet we were only blocks away from crossing the river to the fancy shopping side. We also had breakfast at the hotel restaurant. Extremely good about 15 each but a nice meal. We also did the Starbucks too which was on the ground floor. This hotel allowed dogs in , but it did not smell like ""dog"".",nan,1,ex1906
expedia,A centrally located reasonably priced hotel. good value overall. Service at the restaurant was poor- took 12 minutes to be seated for breakfast ( with 4 parties waiting) while the hostess what chatting with some waiters in the background. Not the fault of the hotel though. One bad apple.,nan,1,ex1907
expedia,Excelente todo muy bien...,nan,1,ex1908
expedia,"I would definitely book again here when coming to Chicago. Great service, great beds, daily complimentary coffee and wine, fast WiFi, fast elevators, comfortable lobby, incredible location, good TV menu, hot water, room and aisles not cold at all even though outside was 20's and not as expensive as others in the same area.",nan,1,ex1909

expedia,"It is a good hotel but I wanted to have a coffee machine in the room. Although there is a cafe next to the hotel and the lobby has welcome drinks in the evening, I would still want a in-room coffee or tea service. I did not also feel that receptionists are warm welcoming guests.",nan,1,ex1911
expedia,"Great hotel in a central location. Housekeeping staff were excellent and worked to a high standard. The reception staff were very helpful and made you feel welcome and part of the family. Thoroughly enjoyed the hospitality event every evening. The room itself was clean and comfortable, slept like babies in the bed. Don't let the fact that it is near the EL put you off. The views from the 14th floor where we were are amazing.",nan,1,ex1912
expedia,"This is a very nice hotel with a nice price and good location close to theaters, restaurants and shopping. The lovely lobby is a perfect place to enjoy the complimentary coffee or tea in the morning.",nan,1,ex1913
expedia,"Our visit to the Hotel Allegro was just one overnight. We had tickets to a play at the theater was right next door so the location of the hotel was very convnient. The room was small, so there was a sense of claustrophobia at times. But the public spaces on the main level were accessible and that allowed us to go down to that level and we were able to comfortably read our story book in front of a cozie fireplace. In a way, this gave me a sense of being at leisurely bed and breakfast rather than a fancy downtown hotel, which one might think would be cold and snooty. The lobby was beautifully decorated for the holidays. Each staff member we encountered was very polite and professional while still giving us very personal attention. Being located in the Loop, I thought we might experience traffic sounds throughout the stay, but that was not the case. You wouldn't even know that one of the busiest streets in the city was just floors below. The Hotel Allegro is a pricey hotel, as I said the room was small ... but for cleanliness, location, personal service and attention, and overall experience it was worth it.",nan,1,ex1914
expedia,"First, this is in the Loop and the theater district, so if you don't care for that you are just odd :) Seriously, since the Burnham has become so expensive, I've enjoyed calling the Allegro my Chicago home. Kimpton knows hospitality. However, if it were poorly run or had serious safety risks, you'd never know because hotels dot you know rejects reviews like that without ever wanting to discuss it with you. So the Capt.Obvious campaign is a fantasy.",nan,1,ex1915
expedia,"Great location, quiet room on south side of hotel, very comfortable. Room could use a comfortable lounge chair so sitting on the bed is not only place to read etc. could use a robe hook on bathroom door and music in common areas could be toned down a bit. All in all we would stay here again for sure!",nan,1,ex1916
expedia,"We hadn't stayed at the Allegro for a while, so we were excited to return. First, the good parts: big television, stocked mini bar, location close to the opera and theaters, & accommodation for one person. Upsetting: only one chair in the room, tiny bathroom with little counter space, no coffee maker, room renovation turned from quirky cool to sterile silver and white resulting in diminished charm, and no room service despite the great 312 Restaurant on site. We would think twice about staying here again.",nan,1,ex1917
expedia,"Hotel is in an excellent area, close to all the main attractions. The room and view was pretty average considering the cost of the stay. Saying that we were not in the hotel much so it worked out really great for us exploring the city. The free wine and beers each day at 5 was a hit after a long day walking around :)",nan,1,ex1918
expedia,"Great Spot, Amenities and Staff. Business Trip to Chicago and this location was recommended. Great choice!",nan,1,ex1919
expedia,Hotel was very good. Everything you need - Starbucks attached to the lobby so you can get your morning drink without going outside; nice lounging lobby; room was nicely decorated - Kimpton look however bathroom was tiny.,nan,1,ex1920
expedia,"Great hotel in a fantastic location. It's an easy walk to theatres and shopping. Millenium Park is just six blocks away. You also have the train station right across the street. It's right next door to a wonderful restaurant, 312! I'm definitely staying there again.",nan,1,ex1921
expedia,"Unfortunate not to have a nice bar or restaurant available, 312 restaurant was closed for private party and had strange hours when open. Great location for downtown. Nice to have Starbucks connected. Nice to have comp coffee - tea bar in the morning & 5pm wine hour.",nan,1,ex1922
expedia,"We came for our anniversary. I loved the atmosphere here. Small rooms, but we were not in there enough for it to bother me. Very close to a lot of things",nan,1,ex1923
expedia,"Checked in Thursday evening. The woman checked us in wasnt very warm and friendly. She barely made eye contact and was a bit condescending when I asked about the Karma rewards program. However, the guy that was checking in the couple right next to us was very friendly, jovial, welcoming. We wished he checked us in! Once we got inside the room, it was a bit of a shock that it was pretty small, although we read that from other reviewers. Its manageable, but given the location and age of the building, its expected that the rooms will be on the smaller size. The location of the hotel is wonderful. Its in the theatre district, millenium park, the bean, the christmas market are all in walking distance. There are no late night bars or food options which a bit of a problem when we got hungry at night. I love the wine and beer hour from 5-6pm. They were not skimpy on that and the staff was great. There was a small problem with the mini bar. We asked for it to be locked, which was locked when we checked in. On the 2nd day after housekeeping, it was unlocked. I called down and informed them we did not have a key and did not unlock it, and would not be paying for anything that was missing. They locked it the next day. Upon checkout, we were charged for two items but they quickly took it off when I Reminded them of the conversation. Overall my stay was great. I would definitely return to this hotel.",nan,1,ex1924
expedia,"Allegro was my target hotel, as I was going to a concert at the theatre in the same block. Small room right off elevator and across from housekeeping access (staff was very noisy). However, room was clean and nicely appointed (I would expect nothing less from the Kimpton brand.) Price was totally out of line with the room, but it (sadly) made sense when I learned there was a wedding party in the house and it was also a Bears home game (vs. the Vikings). That said, the convenience factor (to theatre, shopping on State St., Millenium Park, etc.)and the chance to get away if only for a brief time trumped all!",nan,1,ex1925
expedia,"The hotel is in a great neighborhood, great service, and great rooms!front desk was very helpful with good suggestions on activities. In the heart of the theatre district. We called the desk at 2am and got prompt service. Beautiful lobby with great coffee service and wine social(didn't partake in the wine).I would stay here again!",nan,1,ex1926
expedia,"Near theaters, dramatic lobby. Free wine and beer from 5-6pm, coffee served in morning, but no room service. Staff was very accommodating. My suite was large.",nan,1,ex1927
expedia,Super slow checkin. Small room. But otherwise a nice place. I stay at Kimptons fairly regularly that have much better service.,nan,1,ex1928
expedia,"Conceirge was great before and after we arrived. The Loop trains stations only a block or 2 away, easy to walk to Mag Mile and to get to Stadiums. Room small but had everything we needed and the hotel is an eclectic mix of colours and styles, very well put together. Loved the 5-6 pm happy hour drinks. Recommend staying here",nan,1,ex1929
expedia,"Very nice hotel. Room small (Euro-sized) but very clean, comfortable and well appointed.",nan,1,ex1930
expedia,Loved the social hour with complimentary beer and wine. Very casual atmosphere. i enjoyed my stay immensely! I had Ravioli in the restaurant that was better than any I've had anywhere else!!!!! The Front Desk staff went well beyond anything I expected. Very nice hotel!,nan,1,ex1931
expedia,Went to Chicago for a Bob Dylan concert at the Cadillac Palace. This hotel was right next door to the theater. Clean rooms and an excellent staff.,nan,1,ex1932
expedia,"Good location but small room with noisy aircon and no opening window. Allocated room on floor booked for election night party so suffered a disturbed night. Mentioned at checkout but obviously, the election business was much more valuable than our Expedia booking. Both myself and my wife suffered itching and raised lumps overnight (not before or after our stay) and we wondered if perhaps we may not have been the only occupants of the bed.",nan,1,ex1933
expedia,"Centrally located, lovely hotel. Would definitely stay here again.",nan,1,ex1934
expedia,Nice hotel. Great location for walking to most attractions. Friendly staff.,nan,1,ex1935
expedia,Good central location. Everything was fine apart from the lack of simple to acceess free wifi. The hotel required payment for access or completion of a registration page. None of this is necessary in 2014. Happily the Starbucks next door is free access / no password. Simple! - as it should be,nan,1,ex1936
expedia,"Nice redo but still is a stretch to call it a ""boutique hotel"". New paint and some wall paper does not boutique make. But- comfy bed and quiet rooms. Nice lobby.",nan,1,ex1937
expedia,The hotel rooms are dated. Kind of small.The bed had seen better days. The wallpaper was peeling in the room. The only good thing about this hotel is the location. Also just to note there is no free Wi-Fi in the rooms. You have to sign up for kimpton rewards in order to get free Wi-Fi.,nan,1,ex1938
expedia,"Centrally located, clean, quiet (inspite of the thin walls...). Overall, very good!",nan,1,ex1939
expedia,"This use to be a fun hotel in a great location. Well, location is still good but the hotel is showing age. They are soon to undergo a big renovation--and it sounds like this is becoming more of a corporate/event hotel. If that's your thing, certainly check it out--but if you like fun boutique spots, go elswhere!",nan,1,ex1940
expedia,"Nice and comfortable room, good price, wine and beer hour at 5 PM a nice touch! Close to everything.",nan,1,ex1941
expedia,"Overall a good hotel. The staff was nice. The room was small. The mattress wasn' t the best, but not horrible. At least it was king-size. The hotel is in the theater district and 4 blocks from thw Lyric Opera. An 'L' stop is less than 2 blocks away. I would stay there again and recommend it to others.",nan,1,ex1942
expedia,Hotel was nice but no room service available.,nan,1,ex1943
expedia,"Disappointing. The hotel special marketing staff never returned the call to extend the wedding group rate as they told the wedding couple they would. Tired of waiting, we booked the room thru Expedia for the same rate. The ""best view"" room overlooked a parking lot, and the closet was too narrow to hang up clothes. Request to move was accommodated without hassle. Housekeeping did not really clean the room. Floor was dirty by the bed, and the bathtub not clean for bath. No way to make hot water for tea, etc.",nan,1,ex1944
expedia,We stayed at this hotel for 4 nights. Hotel has great location but what we liked the most is the happy hour the hotel offers daily at 5 pm. Staff is very friendly and helpful. For sure we'll stay again on this hotel.,nan,1,ex1945
expedia,"Smal rooms, needs security coming up.",nan,1,ex1946
expedia,"Came into town for 1 night. Check in staff was efficient and helpful. Allowed us to store our 4 bicycles with the front desk. Room size was decent, a bit on the small side, but totally doable. Like that there is a Starbucks within walking distance, Dunkin Donuts as well. Parking Fee's are a joke!!! You can park down the street for much cheaper, though don't leave valuables visible or they will be gone!!!",nan,1,ex1947
expedia,"Excellent location. Could walk to and from the marathon. Clean room, comfy bed. Room and bathroom a tad small, but it was no big deal.",nan,1,ex1948

expedia,Great hotel and fun decor.,nan,1,ex1951
expedia,"Really comfortable stay. Happy hour was fun in the lobby. Nice to see the odd dog coming and going. Staff were very friendly and helpful. The concierge helped find a nice brunch spot. The room was a good size, the bathroom was very small, but well appointed.",nan,1,ex1952
expedia,"When we arrived for our late arrival they gave us a Queen size room. We paid for a Deluxe King, so needless to say we were disappointed by the size and amenities of the room. It was too late and we were too tired to complain. The lobby and sitting areas are beautiful and uniquely designed, as is the room. Very classy and quirky. Morning coffee/tea was very appreciated. We missed having access to a pool/Jacuzzi however.",nan,1,ex1953
expedia,"The building is fairly old but the rooms was nicely presented and large. The staff were extremely friendly and helpful. The location is good with shops, bars and restaurants all within close walking distance. Will definitely stay there again when in Chicago.",nan,1,ex1954
expedia,"I thoroughly enjoyed my stay at the Allegro. It is an easy walk to the Lyric Opera, the theaters, Millennium Park, the Art Institute, etc. My room was a generous size, as was the bathroom. It was very clean and in good condition. The bed was very comfortable. I will certainly stay there again the next time I'm in Chicago.",nan,1,ex1955
expedia,"This hotel is stylish and located on Randolph St which is the address of many great eateries. Theaters are nearby as are several subway stops. A little farther away but really walkable, is Millenium Park, the Art Institute of Chicago and the river boat tours. I requested a room higher up to avoid the noise from the ""L"". We were on the 18th floor and it was fine. The only noise was from hotel guests returning late and not caring there were others sleeping! The only big negative for us was the tight bathroom but at least it was clean.",nan,1,ex1956
expedia,"Nice little hotel, conveniently located. It seemed that most of the clients were younger, louder, less considerate of others...I suffered through listening to the young woman in the room next to mine as she moaned her way through the middle of the night. You might want to consider bringing earplugs.",nan,1,ex1957
expedia,"As all Kimpton Hotels, the Allegro is a bit quirky. The lobby is plush, elevators play non-conventional music and rooms are stylishly decorated. The hotel is on the older side though and while it has clearly been updated there are some signs of its age. The rooms are tiny and the closet wasn't large enough for an actual bar on which to hang clothes. Despite the size, the room was well-appointed, clean and quiet. The attached restaurant is outstanding. A good choice for those looking for a convenient location, but who don't plan on spending a lot of time in the room (b/c it's tiny!).",nan,1,ex1958
expedia,The location was perfect to access everything we wanted to see by either walking or public transport. The staff was excellent. We enjoyed the evening wine hours before heading out for the evening.,nan,1,ex1959
expedia,"The location is convenient, staff are friendly, overall feel very good.",nan,1,ex1960
expedia,"A good size lobby with tea and coffee in the morning shame they did not have Breakfast tea, only flavoured teas which were very sweet. Free wine tasting in the evening was a nice surprise. A good number of chairs and sofas to sit at. Room was very nice, clean and recently redecorated, reasonable size ditto bathroom which had a lot of comp. items included.",nan,1,ex1961
expedia,Nice hotel in a good location. Lovely staff with good manners. Comfortable bed. Very small room. The lobby carpet made me dizzy.,nan,1,ex1962

expedia,"My wife and I were only here for a night. We spent the day on Michigan Ave. and needed a place to stay overnight. It was cheaper than the big chains in the area (Hilton, Hyatt, etc.) but the quality didn't suffer. Clean room and friendly staff. Check-in was at 3 but since our room was ready they let us come early. The room was a little smaller but no complaints as we were only there for a few hours. Would recommend; would stay again.",nan,1,ex1968

expedia,"Have had very good experiences at Kimpton hotels in Chicago, and went in with high expectations. Checkin was very fast, professional, and courteous. Room was available immediately despite fairly early check-in. Got to room and found everything to be very clean and functional. The only negatives were that vending was only available on even numbered floors, and my room had no place to hang clothes other than the door stop at the top of the room door. The music at the entrance and in the elevators was a little different experience as the hotel really is trying to exhibit a ""hip factor"" Not off putting, but a little comical for us older folks.",nan,1,ex1970
expedia,"I like the hotel's lobby, the decoration is nice. Don't miss out the wine hour.",nan,1,ex1971
expedia,"great location, but hotel itself not so great. small room yes but we were gone most of the day, bed made too much noise. problem was the VERY extremely thin walls. we heard EVERYTHING in rooms next to us. very uncomfortable personal conversations, etc.. bathroom very tiny. but it had everything you need. booked it because of price point . won't book again because of the noise issue.",nan,1,ex1972
expedia,"Our 3 night stay was quite pleasant. The staff is great, from the frontdesk to the bellboys and cleaning staff. Hotel has a great ambiance (it's a typical older downtown Chicago hotel) and a great bar/restaurant. The room was good but the size of the bathroom is definitely something you have to get used to (if you can). It is VERY small (I am a European and remember bathroom sizes like this back in the old country) It is possible to take a shower, but good luck trying to get into- and out of the tub....It's kind of funny actually. Overall though, we enjoyed our stay. WiFi is only available for free if you sign up to be on the hotel e-mail list and become a ""member"" of their club....I signed up just for the free WiFi. We would go back here now knowing that the bathroom issue is something we have to deal with.",nan,1,ex1973
expedia,"This is a fine Kimpton hotel in the western Loop. It is very comfortable with fine service and a fine Italian restaurant, 312, on its first floor. Would definitely return if I need to be in the neighborhood.",nan,1,ex1974
expedia,"The hotel is located in an area that's considered the Theater district. It's great during the day but past 8pm it gets a little dicey. The entrance to the hotel is by no means grand and there are few doormen who help with opening doors and luggage. The lobby is a grand long room that's perfect for relaxing and hanging out. Although crazy busy at times because of free cocktail hour. Fast elevators and our room was nice, no view at all, sort of large with unused space that made you wish they decorated differently. I think they hold open space for beds for kids. They should utilize the space with furniture that makes unpacking and staying there more convenient when you DON'T have roll-outs in the room. Our bathroom was very nicely appointed but so tiny you could almost not move around.",nan,1,ex1975
expedia,This is a nice hotel in a really good locality. Staff was friendly. Overall a very satisfactory stay.,nan,1,ex1976
expedia,Hotel was just ok and I had expected more having stayed at other Kimpton hotels before. The staff at this one was not so friendly and our room was an adjoining room and it felt like the people in the other room were directly in our room. Bed was comfortable and AC was great so overall our experience was ok but not the great I have come to expect from Kimpton.,nan,1,ex1977
expedia,"Hotel was walking distance from many of Chicago's main attractions, which was great. Beautiful lobby and comfortable rooms. Less some weird spotting on the furnature, it was a great stay.",nan,1,ex1978

It is also very close to City Hall, County Offices and the Thompson State of Illinois building. If you have business with any of these agencies you cannot go wrong by staying here.",nan,1,ex1981

expedia,"Rooms clean but small, wifi not free, parking not free, no complimentary breakfast, coffee free and good. The prices are ridiculous in chicago, for the price you pay for a hotel room it could be nicer but it served its purpose, the only reason we chose this hotel was it was 2 blocks from where we had to be.",nan,1,ex1983
expedia,The rooms are a bit small but it was still a good hotel in a great location in walking distance from many of the places we love going to when visiting Chicago. We had a room change which took a little longer than it should have but other than that hang up it was great.,nan,1,ex1984
expedia,"I called in advance to inquire about parking and was told: 1. Self parking is unavailable, and I MUST use their Valet service. 2. Valet will be xx. When driving by, I saw (without searching for) 2 self-parking lots literally under 1 minute away from my hotel which were less than half the price. But I pulled up to the hotel to follow the directions I was given. After valet service had taken my car, I saw a ""xx"" 7 on the wall for Valet.. I asked the desk attendant if any recent changes had been made, and he said ""No."", but I assumed he wasn't the one I spoke to and didn't bother to take my frustrations out on him. The hotel room I chose was the ""Deluxe King"" bed for a decent bit more than the next cheapest room. It was, by far, the smallest hotel room I've ever been in. The bed was a king sized, as advertised, and it was VERY nice. But the room had very little room outside of that. It felt quite cramped. The ""Best View"" option is what I chose as my 'main preference' during check-in. I honestly think I might've received one of the 'best views', but if that is the case then I believe it shouldn't even be an option as all you could see was directly into some office building across the street. This may be due to the location, as it was my first trip to Chicago, but I was astonished when I asked if I could use a microwave in the dining area and was told it would be ten and they'd bring one to my room instead. Also shocking, fridges were unavailable as well.",nan,1,ex1985
expedia,"We were in Chicago to visit family and have stayed at the Allegro before. We originally chose the Allegro for location. We wanted a hotel close to the blue line. We returned because it was a nice, well appointed hotel at a reasonable price for the area. I am sure we will return.",nan,1,ex1986
expedia,"Hotel Allegro is very convenient to public transportation and an easy walk to key attractions like Millenium Park, the museums, and many bars and restaurants. The hotel is small (closets and bathrooms are miniscule), but clean and nicely decorated. The amenities (free wine hour, bike rentals, etc.) are a nice touch. I think for the location and the price, this is a great place to stay for a short trip in Chicago.",nan,1,ex1987
expedia,"Hotel Allegro is one of the best hotels in/near the loop. I love it because it has it's own identity. It is beautifully decorated, inviting, and reasonably priced. This hotel could likely charge more for it's rooms. They hold your bags for you free of charge if your room is not ready and the complimentary happy hour is very nice.",nan,1,ex1988

Two people cannot be in there at the same time. The windows are very old with paint coming off. The bed was very comfortable. The cleaning staff was very annoying by knocking on the door the first time at 8:30 am, then again 20 mins later and a third time 20 mins after that! Check out is not until noon. So I got the impression they wanted us out of there! Customer service at the front desk was great and so was valet. Would I stay there again, doubtful!",nan,1,ex1992

I booked for three people and I said this will not be comfortable. Then I was told by the front desk guy I was talking that "" this is what you get when you booked from a third party"" so rude comment and I don't appreciate it. Btw I booked thru expedia. I requested for a pull away bed and was told of the extra charge of $20.00 per day Despite of the above, we had a great stay and the ambience of the hotel was really great.

Even charger or iron for hair... First time I met service like that! Plus the shampoo and conditioning for hair (special edition for Kimpton hotels) - just perfect!! I'm gonna buy that for home use. We had a free coffee/water with some berries (very nice idea to put it inside the jar and change berries every day!) in the morning, and wine/sangria in the evening.

expedia,"I was here for 5 nights on business. The location is at the outlet of the loop so getting around is easy. The rooms are quite small by Chicago standards. The building is dated but superficially updated. The room was clean and the service friendly and accommodating. I did have one problem with the facilities and staff. The lobby would get overloaded at peak hours. This would cause long wait times for elevators to the higher floors. This would be made worse by having a ground and lobby floor. Similarly, a long line formed for bag services. While the elevators are hard to work around, they probably need to hire more staff.",nan,1,ex2011

We look for clean facilities, good showers and comfortable beds. In addition we enjoyed a great location within walking distance of great shopping, theaters and great night life. In addition we were treated to a nightly wine tasting hour with h'or d'oeuvres in the very nicely laid out lobby area. Not much more you could ask for! Our room had absolutely no view but we did not mind a bit!",nan,1,ex2016

It ended up having a paper thin door to an adjoining room with loud kids, and best of all, the L train ran right under the room window and shook the whole room. They did accommodate a move, but it was a lower grade than I had booked.",nan,1,ex2017

After security left they were loud again. I called the front desk and the women told me I had a complaint against myself bc I banged on the wall to let them know they were too loud. She refused to listen to my complaint that they were partying again. I wont stay there again. Very disappointing.,nan,1,ex2022
expedia,"I stayed in Kimpton Allegro on Saturday night in July. I was able to get a reasonably good rate from Expedia - $200 with taxes for a king bed room. The check in time started at 3 pm. I arrived to the hotel at noon and a receptionist took my phone number and called me an hour later (while I was having lunch in a nearby cafe) to notify me that my room was ready. The room was on the 11th floor. There are only 3 guest elevators in the building and no matter time of day or night, they were always slow/ and full. So one time I ended up using a service elevator, after waiting for a guest elevator for more than 5 minutes. The room was clean and the bed was comfortable. Despite A/C being set to 65 degrees, the room felt dump and humid. The bathroom was small and the toilet was clogged. Before I used it for a first time I had to call maintenance to fix it. They did..and after flashing 3 or 4 sheets of toilet paper it clogged again!!! The ice machines were only on even floors and it so happened that the machines on 10th and 12th floors were out of ice, so it took me a while to fill the ice bucket. Despite the hotel being in a nice location, I would not stay there again... I never had to deal with a clogged toilet in the hotel, and it happened twice here...",nan,1,ex2023
expedia,"Enjoyed my stay and noticed needed updates in decor this trip. Allegro Hotel is convenient walk to the Mart, Theaters, and not far from Miracle Mile. Wine tasting is a nice respite after working all day at the Merchandise Mart and the Deco Decadent lobby and rooms are a pleasing sensory overload. Encore restaurant /lounge is also nice looking but needs an expanded menu and next door restaurnt 312 is a bit pricey but great service and ambiance. Happy to stay for future trips!",nan,1,ex2024

expedia,"I travel frequently and have stayed at Kimpton hotels before. This stay ruined Kimpton for me. I was moving across the country and chose this hotel as a good place to stop and rest. Under the watch of housekeeping staff, while we were checking in, our cooler with water, food, etc. was stolen from the lobby when we stepped out for a few minutes to move our vehicle. We arrived at 4am, given that our food and water was gone, we asked if they could give us a few bottles of water and snacks or point us in the direction of a vending machine. They declined the request and had us walk to a 24 hour convenient store a few blocks away...at 4am in Chicago. Overall the service was terrible. I called 5 days in advance and the day of to remind them that I'd be traveling with a dog and cat, thinking they'd have a litter box, beds, bowls...not the case, we waited until the next day for a litter box. Do not stay at this hotel.",nan,1,ex2027

The staff was very friendly, rooms were a bit small but comfortable. Only thing missing, aside from the bathroom, there were no other mirrors in the room. Hotel was walking distance to parks and centrally located in the theater district. I would definitely here stay again.",nan,1,ex2028
expedia,"My husband and I stayed from Thursday night to Sunday morning. The bed was very comfortable and the bathroom is huge. There are plenty of outlets to plug in ipads, phone chargers, etc. It's a very loud hotel-there is loud music playing in the entrance and lobby of hotel, and from your room you can hear people in the hallway and people on the floor above you. The workout room is really nice-with plenty of towels, water and late-model exercise machines. The room is set at 66 degrees and when we moved the thermostat to 70, the heat kicked on. The room is small-only the bed and a small desk. The staff is very nice.",nan,1,ex2029
expedia,"Able to check in a little early and parking was close by. Liked internal entrances to Encore for great drinks and to 312 Chicago for an excellent dinner with superb service and a great breakfast with superb service. Convenient for walking to the Oriental Theater to see Motown. Disappointed in the size of the Deluxe king size bed room and bathroom and other negative features such as no loveseat or additional seating, a coffee maker and other amenities compared to other hotels we have stayed at in downtown Chicago. I marked Yes for recommending this hotel to a friend because of its location to surrounding theaters, restaurants, and points of interest and not for the quality of the hotel room features.",nan,1,ex2030

Close to the Blue Line and within walking distance of the Red Line and a number of buses. A 10 minute walk to Millenium Park & Grant Park. Room was small and the bed was a little softer than we were used to, but all in all, a good place to sleep every night! We'd stay again if in Chicago soon!!",nan,1,ex2032

expedia,"The entrance to the hotel was dramatic, which makes sense considering it is in the theater district. The decor was astonishing, in a good way. I have never stayed in a Kimpton hotel before, but have been told that each one is decorated individually. The lobby was huge and inviting, with several different areas with slightly different styles in the different rooms. The staff were pleasant to interact with. I didn't use the concierge (as I used to live in Chicago), but she seemed reasonably knowledgeable about what was available to do in the area. People did seem to interact a bit in the lobby, where there was coffee/tea in the morning and wine/beer in the evening. They are pretty good with details, such as a different fruit or mint infused in the water available in the lobby each day. The rooms are a little smaller than some places, but that is typical for many older or historic buildings in the Chicago Loop - and the design makes clever use of the space. I even had a bit of a view from my window.",nan,1,ex2035
expedia,"Hotel was very modern and clean. Location is great! In the loop, in theater district. Can walk to a lot or take the L which isn't far either. Great amenities and VERY friendly staff.

expedia,"Allegro is an excellent choice for either the casual traveler or the business professional that enjoys socializing. The 5pm wine hour works well for either of these, and the helpful staff is always ready to answer questions about the hotel or surrounding area as they pour your refreshment. Excellent price for the quality of the hotel. Well appointed, good coffee, free paper, and quality bedding. The other guests are the hotel's greatest asset: take advantage of the cocktail hour even if you choose not to imbibe. Have a soft drink and enjoy your fellow travelers. There's no telling who you may meet. Will be staying here again soon.",nan,1,ex2038
expedia,"The hotel was a terrible experience. They charge for WiFi, and then charged us a huge minibar fee because we pulled out soda and a bottle of wine from the fridge to make room for our own drinks one night. The sodas and wine were right on top of the minifridge, but we were still charged daily for the drinks. I tried to speak to the front desk about this, but they said that pulling the sodas out of the fridge was equivalent to drinking them. There was also no room service, and the delivered food we left by the trash was never picked up unless it was in the small trash bins. Each day the maids knocked on the door at 9am, which is a little early when your room doesn't come with do not disturb sign and the bed is so uncomfortable we both woke up like 3-4 times per night. The place was pretty empty, and yet they put us in a room that had a brick wall that was 2 feet from our window. You could reach out the window and touch the next door building. The room was dark with no light. The 'deluxe' king room had nowhere to sit, one chair at the desk and just enough room to fit a tv, desk and king bed. My boyfriend and I were constantly walking on top of each other, there was barely enough room to walk by the bed it was so close to the wall. Given how empty the hotel was, it was a real shame they put paying customers in a room so small with such a horrible view of the city and such an uncomfortable bed. I will never stay here or any other Klimpton hotel again",nan,1,ex2039

Complimentary food was served 4 different times a day in the private lounge, all types of beverages were available 24 hours, we had complimentary hi-speed internet access, I was awakened each morning with complimentary coffee delivered to my room and I had access to a large-screen computer monitor with complimentary printing.

expedia,Was a Great experince I really love every single thing,nan,1,ex2093
expedia,"My husband and I spent a few days in the city when he came home on military leave. We were recommended this hotel. The location is great, we wanted to be near the park, but that's about all we liked. Compared to other hotels we stayed at in the city, this was probably the most expensive and also the one we disliked the most. The room we chose through expedia had a king sized bed and a city view. Once we got there we were given a double room, we quickly got that changed back to a king, but we didn't have the city view we were supposed to have. We also wanted a room with a bath but were extremely disappointed when the bath plug to the drain did not work at all. It's just not worth the price. There are quite a few places that we've stayed at downtown that were half the price, way nicer, and included things like complimentary internet and breakfast.",nan,1,ex2094
expedia,Nice hotel with an excellent location downtown...close to restaurants,nan,1,ex2095
expedia,The room was amazing. Very neat and was very comfortable.,nan,1,ex2096
expedia,"Loved our stay. Close to Millennium Park (our main destination). Staff was friendly and accommodating. Lake view. Quite. Nicely appointed room. Beverages in fridge was for fee but it wasn't clear if coffee was complementary so we didn't touch it. Disappointed to learn that wifi and fitness center was not complimentary. Online description, as well as direct hotel site, was vague. Front-desk staff recognized our disappointment and gave us 24-hr free wifi. Not a big deal since we stayed only 1 night. If we were to stay longer, we'd stay elsewhere. Why is it these high-end hotels charge for wi-fi? There's a proposal in congress for hotels to be able to block hotspots - I definitely would not frequent them. Otherwise, nice stay.",nan,1,ex2097
expedia,Nice hotel clean rooms would stay again close to shopping and resturants nice view of fireworks,nan,1,ex2098
expedia,everything was perfect if I had to find 1 thing to complain about it would be Parking I know its Chicago and I know parking is expensive but $65.00 is a bit much. That said I had a wonderful time checkin check out was a breeze place was imaculate veiw was great and everything is close,nan,1,ex2099
expedia,"We celebrated NYE 2015 at The Fairmont Chicago. Our room was clean and the bed was comfortable. The hotel staff was kind and attentive, even on a busy New Year's Eve. Short cab ride from Union Station. I would definitely stay here again.",nan,1,ex2100
expedia,Close to Michigan Ave highlights but not as convenient to restaurant choices especially on a Sunday or holiday morning. Overall a very good choice.,nan,1,ex2101
expedia,"Great hotel. We checked out at noon, but the valet service allowed us to spend the day in the city before having to get the car, thus we didn't have to pay to park somewhere else.",nan,1,ex2102
expedia,"My wife had visited the hotel prior to a recent remodeling and was very disappointed upon her return. The room was clean, but its update made it completely bland. The coffee maker worked well enough, but was strangely tucked in a cabinet under the TV instead of the beverage area outside of the bathroom. The worst part of the room was the bed: a king size with two well-defined divots that was only slightly less comfortable than a hammock...not what was expected for a hotel in this area and at this price point.",nan,1,ex2103
expedia,"The Fairmont Chicago has the ""Best of the Best"" in Customer Service/Guest Experience of all the hotels I have stayed at over the past couple of years. I frequently travel from as far as north as Toronto, to as far west as California, and the customer service/guest experience my husband and I recently received at the Fairmont over New Year's was hands down the ""BEST OF BREED"". We booked a room on the Fairmont Club 15th floor, which offers some extra amenities such as a private guest lounge area with a panoramic view of Chicago, and they serve free breakfast, an early evening cocktail hour with a full service (cash) bar. All of these things make the Fairmont a bit more special and stand out from other hotels, but their number one best asset is they have the most wonderful and accommodating staff we have had the pleasure to meet. We received a private check in staff and concierge on our floor who were by far, the nicest group of folks who went way beyond the call of duty. Cody was the best Concierge/Supervisor along with Henry, Hayley, Alex and even the front door staff member Benjamin was an absolute delight, all of them went out of their way to ensure we had everything possible to enjoy our stay. They went over and beyond the call of duty on a daily basis to ensure we had the best guest experience possible. The Fairmont is very lucky to have such dedicated and wonderful staff who truly care about the guest experience. BRAVO FAIRMONT STAFF & THANK YOU!",nan,1,ex2104
expedia,"We stayed at the Fairmont for three nights. It is a beautiful, clean hotel near the Magnificent Mile and other attractions. A cab ride to restaurants and museums was very reasonable. The staff was generally friendly. We enjoyed the New Year's Eve fireworks from Navy Pier. I would have given this hotel a higher rating except for the following: High fees for internet service and parking. On-site restaurant was outrageously expensive. My biggest problem was with the doors to the rooms. All the doors would slam shut. All night long I could hear the creak of the door handles to other rooms, then I would count to three, and the doors would slam shut. Our friends that also stayed in the hotel could hear the elevator all night.",nan,1,ex2105
expedia,"I stayed for New Year's Eve & was placed in a corner room. The hotel has electric heat and our room was so drafty. We turned the thermostat up to 90 degrees and our room continued to be 60 degrees. Staff did a great job of accommodating us by moving us into a more centralized room. If you plan on staying here, try to avoid the corner rooms!",nan,1,ex2106
expedia,"Amazing hotel! Rooms were clean, classy, and comfortable. Location is great and hotel staff was extremely accommodating. Definitely plan to retun.",nan,1,ex2107
expedia,Fighing on my floor Lots of yelling and couldn't sleep,nan,1,ex2108

expedia,Wonderful!,nan,1,ex2111
expedia,"The hotel was great, room was very nice and clean,the view was AMAZING. Overall, everything was perfect for our New Years Eve stay.",nan,1,ex2112
expedia,"Clean room and friendly staff. Stayed on the Gold floors with the lounge, and was worth the up charge.",nan,1,ex2113
expedia,"It is a nice hotel that is trying to stay exclusive but it looks like it is slowly degrading. The beds are extremely small and the rooms, while luxurious, are starting to show their age. Because of the low price compared to other hotels in the area, they attract some questionable characters. Amenities and restaurants in the hotel are expensive.",nan,1,ex2114
expedia,"Good location and generally convenient to most activities. However, this hotel needs upgrading for sure if it is to live up to the Fairnont experience. Hotel restaurant was very average.",nan,1,ex2115
expedia,"We stayed at the Fairmont Hotel for New Year's Eve. The location is ideal as it is near Millennium Park. Also, near Michigan Ave and a short walk to Navy Pier. The rooms are nicely decorated and we loved the separate tub and shower in the bathroom. The beds were nice and comfortable too! We would definitely stay there again.!",nan,1,ex2116
expedia,I booked this hotel to bring in the New Year with my wife. We arrived their were valet vehicles everywhere. We had to wait approx 30 before they took my vehicle. We were referred by the the food was excellent at the hotel restaurant The food was very salty and not well cooked. Our room was freezing cold maintenance was contacted and he changed the filter and called housekeeping to bring us more blankets. We were told to put a blanket at the food it should help with the draft coming from the hall. Well it didn't the bath was so cold we couldn't take a shower so we left the hotel at 5:00am. The manager credit the valet of $65.00 and another night stay on them. I declined to go through what me and my wife experience a second time.,nan,1,ex2117
expedia,Had a good time wish my lamp with the ipod doc worked,nan,1,ex2118
expedia,Overall the hotel and the room were very good the room had some issues one it was cold despite trying to increase heat. Also the heating unit was very dirty from when you looked at it from the side plus one of the telephones did not work,nan,1,ex2119
expedia,"This is a very difficult review to write because I am torn. The entire staff couldn't have been friendlier and nicer if they tried. We checked in on Christmas night so we could hang out downtown the day after with our 3 yr old. Got a very nice stocking w/our name on it filled with goodies-- thoughtful! The hotel is dated and a little bit dingy(hallways dark), but clean. Can't beat the location(Millennium Park!)and the staff. Room layout was a little wonky and small. Room service was efficient and good(expensive, but that's room service, ya know?) Figure out what's important to you, but good service is worth a lot in my book so I'd come back for that. However if I was trying to impress anyone probably wouldn't do it here. And once again, Hotel.com is so great to work with!",nan,1,ex2120
expedia,"We had a very nice sized suite, bathroom layout was especially good for a family with a vanity area just outside the bathroom as well as spacious counter inside. Ordered room service which was very good. Pet friendly. Would definitely stay here again.",nan,1,ex2121
expedia,Usually great but definitely dissapointed this time. Room was not ready for guests.,nan,1,ex2122
expedia,"The hotel is conveniently located. Close to many downtown attractions. Rooms are standard, nothing special for the price. The on-site restaurant ""Aria"" is terrible. Don't eat there. Food is greasy and cold; fruit flies are around. I returned my breakfast to the kitchen. They didn't remake it, instead they just warmed up a plate. Not only was I not offered a complimentary meal but even another choice was not given. Poor customer service.",nan,1,ex2123
expedia,"I have stayed at the Fairmont a couple of times and my only complaint would be that they had no tv guide. I especially like that they have a separate makeup area with a lighted magnifying mirror..every hotel should have that. Great location, close to everything. Last stay we had a better view, but our latest room wasn't too bad either. I would definitely choose this hotel again.",nan,1,ex2124
expedia,Perfect. We went for a getaway to see the Christmas market. The location was perfect for everything we wanted to see and do. The staff was friendly and the room was amazing.,nan,1,ex2125
expedia,"The hotel features a grand entry and a huge, impressive, if somewhat cold, lobby. The rooms are pleasant, but not particularly special. The amenities are okay. The staff is pleasant and people are polite. It's not at all a bad place to stay. The location is especially central to the Magnificent Mile and a block from Millenium Park.",nan,1,ex2126
expedia,"As usual, great",nan,1,ex2127
expedia,It is a very nice hotel and very convenient. The staff is very friendly! The room was very well appointed and clean.,nan,1,ex2128
expedia,"The bed was great, health club was nice and we used it, very quiet. On the down side, there was no bedside clock! And getting a taxi took a little time because of the hotel location off the beaten path",nan,1,ex2129
expedia,The three room suite at the weekend rate is the best hotel bargain in town. The rate is about what the other fine hotels charge for a regular room.,nan,1,ex2130
expedia,It was amazing.,nan,1,ex2131
expedia,The hotel rooms are a bit outdated and in need of refurbishing. The club level lounge was just adequate. It also needs updating.,nan,1,ex2132
expedia,"Stayed here for a girls weekend with my sisters, it was within walking distance to Michigan Ave, State St, Millenium Park,...just to name a few. The hotel was very nice for the price. Very Friendly staff. My only complaint is the walls seem thin and you can hear other guests next door....either that or the guests next door to us were just extra loud. Overall I would definitely stay here again!",nan,1,ex2133
expedia,"The hotel was beautiful. The room (we had a king suite) was beautifully appointed. Both the bed and pull out sofa were comfortable and offered a good night's sleep. The bathroom was large and offered a separate boudoir/dressing area with a walk in closet. The staff was very accommodating and friendly. My only, very minor negative observation were a couple of places in the room that showed some wear and tear. A corner of peeling wallpaper, a spot or two of smudges on the paint. Minor cosmetic details. Otherwise, perfect in every way. The hotel is 1/2 mile from the Art Institute, less than a mile from shopping on Michigan Avenue and across the street from Millennium and Grant Parks. Our room had a beautiful city view with glimpses of the lake beyond. The Fairmont is our new regular place to stay when in Chicago.",nan,1,ex2134
expedia,"Room was very clean, liked the big bathroom, however, I wouldnt consider that a waterfall shower head. The only problem I had was u could hear everything in the next room making it difficult to sleep",nan,1,ex2135
expedia,My stay was incredible. The hotel was gorgeous and the staff were nice.. lady at front desk gave us a room with an awesome view. I will definitely be back.,nan,1,ex2136

expedia,"The concierges were amazing. Really took time with us, and their recommendations were great!",nan,1,ex2138
expedia,"this is an awesome hotel. It is in a great location of the hotel stuff is amazing, and some great amenities. Housekeeping does not do a good job on a daily basis of cleaning the room. Everyday, dirty dishes were left in our room. The coffee supply was not refreshed, and the trash was not emptied. Other than that, I highly recommend this hotel.",nan,1,ex2139
expedia,Nice hotel - room walls are paper thin though and you can hear everything your neighbor is doing.,nan,1,ex2140
expedia,Beautiful hotel with very friendly staff. Breakfast was wry good. Fitness center much bigger than I anticipated and more than enough state of the art equipment.,nan,1,ex2141

expedia,"From check-in to check -out it was a great experience, The Registrars, BellMen, Concierges and Taxi Guys were all helpful and gracious. I've traveled extensively through the US, Europe & Asia and can say that this is a Great Hotel. 5 Stars.",nan,1,ex2144
expedia,"Great hotel overall. It need some renovations in the hallways. Rooms are clean, the bathrrom very spacious and nice",nan,1,ex2145
expedia,"Close to Navy Pier, Soldier Field and Millennium Park. In the loop for great access to public transportation. The hotel is typical mediocre room, with an extra cost for everything. No pool or hot tub and no free WiFi ($14/day).",nan,1,ex2146
expedia,Walking distance to just about every attraction. Cabs from hotel not that expensive to farther away attractions,nan,1,ex2147
expedia,We were very happy. After staying Fairmont for 3 times we were gold member for extra benefit which makes different.,nan,1,ex2148
expedia,Very nice lake view @34th floor Room was very clean and nice with a lot space Liked it,nan,1,ex2149

expedia,We enjoyed our visit - Great service!,nan,1,ex2152
expedia,"I knew I wanted to be close to the Magnificient Mile and saw this hotel worked well, but I didn't realize the bonus of being on that end and then close to State street and the museum and great art installations out that way of South Michigan street. I found the room very well appointed and everything very comfortable. It was a grand, yet cozy, classic nice hotel and I would happily book there again.",nan,1,ex2153
expedia,"everything was seamless, from arrival to departure. Excellent service, loved the location.",nan,1,ex2154
expedia,"Good experience, would recommend to others. The size of the rooms, cleanliness, bed comfort, access to cabs and other transportation and easy access to Michigan Avenue sold me!",nan,1,ex2155
expedia,"I left my shoes outside the door of my room on the first night to be cleaned and was surprised when they were not returned the next day. After I made several calls to housekeeping I got a call from Guest Services Manager to advise that they would extensively search the hotel for my shoes, the manager did give me the impression that it was my fault for leaving the shoes outside the door and things get stolen in this hotel - this is the last I heard from anyone in the hotel about my shoes.",nan,1,ex2156
expedia,"Great experience from check in to check out. Fantastic location, a 3 minute walk to""the bean"". Well maintained, clean, great staff.",nan,1,ex2157
expedia,Stayed at the Fairmont Chicago at Millennium Park for a weekend get away and had a great time. The staff was friendly and helpful. Room was very clean and in great condition. I would recommend this hotel for a stay in Chicago.,nan,1,ex2158
expedia,"Could hear a lot. I mean, a LOT: out in the hallway, rooms next door and above flushing, etc. Expected a bit more. Location was fabulous, but may try a different Hotel in the neighborhood next time.",nan,1,ex2159
expedia,Had a fabulous time in Chicago. The Fairmont was very comfortable. Wonderful beds! The Concierge was incredibly helpful - her recommendations were 5 star.,nan,1,ex2160
expedia,"Rooms were clean, nicely updated. Staff was super-responsive to request to change rooms (in order to have adjoining rooms), request to fix a slow-draining shower, etc. Concierge was extremely helpful with great recommendations for restaurants and activities.",nan,1,ex2161
expedia,"Only there for one night. Obvious up scale place. Clean, comfortable, and central to most downtown attractions.",nan,1,ex2162
expedia,Great stay at a world-class property. Attentive staff and wonderful accommodations. Wish my stay was longer!,nan,1,ex2163
expedia,Here for Chicago marathon. Perfect location,nan,1,ex2164
expedia,Wonderful!!! You just go and get excellent experience.,nan,1,ex2165
expedia,I love view of lake. Very clean and friendly. P,nan,1,ex2166
expedia,"The hotel is very nice but they include nothing in the very high room rate. the gym, wi-fi, breakfast, parking are not only not included but also very expensive. Also, the bathroom shower was not great and there was no plug so you could not take a bath. I would not stay there again.",nan,1,ex2167
expedia,"Not sure when this hotel was built or when was the last time they remodeled. But, it can certainly use some needed updating, such as newer and better beds, fixing broken tiles in bathroom, and brightening the lobby area.",nan,1,ex2168
expedia,Check in was fast. The beds were awesome. Nice to have a coffee maker in the room. The paper of your choice at your door was a plus. For our activities the position of the hotel was great. Great view from our window.,nan,1,ex2169
expedia,It was a nice hotel. More dining options would be nice.,nan,1,ex2170
expedia,"The hotel itself is quite good. Staff was courteous and attentive, and our room was comfortable. The on-site restaurant, however, was atrocious. Why pay $50 for greasy, overcooked breakfast and bad coffee for two when you can get the same thing at Denny's for $4 a piece?",nan,1,ex2171
expedia,"I was able to book a room in downtown Chicago the day before I needed it. Not only was the hotel amazing and our rate low, we actually even got a free upgrade! Just be aware of additional parking fees in larger cities. We called ahead to confirm the room and parking fees. Our booking was in their system in less than 5 minutes!",nan,1,ex2172
expedia,"We were so pleasantly surprised by our experience at the Fairmont. We thought that by booking with Hotels.com, we'd get a mediocre room, but were so thrilled to have a room on the 30th floor with a view of the lake. It was superb!",nan,1,ex2173
expedia,"We booked the hotel due to its four stars and great location. It is convenient to walk around and check out night life in Chicago. However, the room is dirty-- the sheets and pillow cases have dirty, black spots, the room has rotten smell. And they nickel and dimed you for any service, even a bottle of water. There is no free WIFI. Overall, it does not fulfill its so claimed four stars hotel.",nan,1,ex2174
expedia,"I was in the Farimont for only one night - Sunday, Sept 14. It is a splendid hotel and my room was all that I could ask for with a great view of the Lake and comfortable furnishings and amenities. I was made to feel very welcome even thought I was using Hotel.com which the Hotel was using to fill its vacant rooms. Some other hotels are not as welcoming.",nan,1,ex2175
expedia,"Great staff, friendly and helpful. Nice rooms. Close to everything.",nan,1,ex2176
expedia,"The hotel was beautiful, comfortable and the staff were excellent. I especially liked the location, it was convenient and also offered plenty of privacy. I will definitely stay here again and so will my traveling friends Who had their own rooms.",nan,1,ex2177
expedia,"Nice room with partial south view of the park, harbor, and Soldier Field. Comfy king bed with quality pillows, linens, etc. A bit pricey, but most hotels of that quality and similar location were priced in the same range.",nan,1,ex2178
expedia,The staff were so friendly & went out of their way to make us feel welcome. Beds were so comfortable and everything was very clean. Would definitely stay here again. Outstanding!,nan,1,ex2179

expedia,"Came in late on Friday, great lobby decor, excellent service. Large room for a downtown location",nan,1,ex2181
expedia,"Walking distance to boat tours and water taxis as well as Millennium Park and Lake Michigan. Excellent view, pleasant staff, spacious, clean and quiet room made for a great stay.",nan,1,ex2182

expedia,Lovely hotel. I would stay there again. Concierge (Gail) was very helpful with dinning options and arranging limo transportation!,nan,1,ex2184
expedia,Great location within walking distance of Millennium Park.. Staff was great and very helpful.. The hotel could stand to be updated but was clean and comfortable.,nan,1,ex2185
expedia,Excellent location and superb room. Concierge very helpful. Hotel accommodated early checking and late checkout without any hassle.,nan,1,ex2186
expedia,"Well a little upset about the room, I was told I was getting a suite and when we arrived and checked in I was given joining rooms, the issue for me is that I was not made aware of this and had to sleep in the same bed with someone else. When I made the front desk aware of this they did not seem to care. I was told that I could have an early check in which did not happen, I was told I could check in at 3pm which did not happen, I was told that other guest who did not check in by 3pm were given a discount and that did not happen for me.The room was very clean.",nan,1,ex2187
expedia,Check in was at 3. We had to wait until 4 for an available room. The carpet was wet in the room.,nan,1,ex2188
expedia,We had to wait allot 2 hours after check in to get in our room. I also called to make the reservation to make sure we could have a roll away bed and then at check in they said they couldn't do that. So they told me they upgraded our room. We had two double beds and a small couch. We had 5 people. They didn't do anything other than the upgrade. We should have been given a discount for the wait and trouble. Didn't even really get a sorry for the wait. When we were leaving we had to wait 40 min to get out car. Paid $65 to park. Just a block away we could have parked for $14. Not going back to this hotel.,nan,1,ex2189
expedia,"My wife and I had a great time in Chicago. The hotel was near a couple of great restaurants, especially Wildberry (breakfast) it was amazing. It is very close to Millennium Park, and maybe some rooms actually had views of it, but ours was mostly blocked by another building, however we did get a great view of Lake Michigan. Very near lake shore which is really great. A bit of a walk for the main section of Michigan Ave., but not to bad. We would definitely stay here again.",nan,1,ex2190
expedia,"I thought that for the money we spent for one night I was expecting a LOT more in luxury! Room was very simple - like any other type of hotel. Room was clean, but the bathroom floor was wet - not sure why - if cleaning was just done or what but that bothered us a bit. Nothing special about the room at all. I did not like the fact that if we wanted a fridge, or other amenities, etc., all that was at an extra charge. With what they charge for rooms there should be more complimentary items! One very nice thing I did like very much was the views out the windows! The location was really nice - close to most things we wanted to see/do. The service of staff was very good and attentive..",nan,1,ex2191
expedia,It was extremely to get to the hotel and back on the highway. The hotel was clean and modern and the Aria food and room service was fantastic! We wi definitely stay there again!,nan,1,ex2192
expedia,"Great hotel, great staff enjoyed our stay. Walking around for us with the loop was a bit confusing and took up more time, but that was all on us!",nan,1,ex2193
expedia,"This hotel is extremely well located within a short distance from all major attractions downtown Chicago. It is equally close to Magnificent Mile, waterfront, all major museums and theaters.",nan,1,ex2194
expedia,"We enjoyed this hotel. Staff was very friendly and we had a nice city view. Beds were comfy, too.",nan,1,ex2195
expedia,"i enjoyed my stay here, very nice rooms, very nice hotel. Inside the hotel there is a very nice bar and restaurant. They have a small gym. BEWARE OF PARKING at the hotel for over night, they will charge you $70!!!!! for valet!?!? thats ridiculous, but whatever its a nice hotel, i will definitely stay here again, just not drive there anymore. There is a CVS across the street that is very very convenient. The restrooms in the rooms are amazingly nice.",nan,1,ex2196
expedia,"Its close to everything, it was very clean and it had great views. Beds were comfortable and the staff was nice",nan,1,ex2197
expedia,I paid 65$ for parking over night. Requested for 10more minutes beyond checkout time and response was very very bad from the front desk,nan,1,ex2198
expedia,"Everyone was very kind and caring. They helped in every aspect to get us settled in. Room was great, clean and ready for us when we checked in. The staff was wonderful always greeting you and smiling. The room had two double beds and there wasn't a thing out of place. Clean, clean clean!!!!!",nan,1,ex2199
expedia,I thought the Fairmont was a very nice hotel. We had a room with a city view and a partial lake view. The room was a good size with a large bathroom. The only complaint I would have would be the cleaning service didn't leave us new soap and hand towels. We called down and got them right away.,nan,1,ex2200
expedia,"My husband and I stayed here for our 5 year anniversary, and the hotel pulled out all the stops for us, bringing us chocolate strawberries and champagne on the house! The room was new, clean and very quiet. We didn't hear any guests while we were there. And the food in the club quarters on the 15th floor was amazing! We may just make this an annual tradition. Oh, and the location is perfect for going anywhere in the loop.",nan,1,ex2201
expedia,Was expecting a nice experience with good amenities and staff/quality of hotel but was disappointed. Felt un-welcomed.,nan,1,ex2202
expedia,"I figured that when you pay 300 dollars for a hotel you wouldn't have to pay 10 dollars for the internet or 65 for parking... Or 3.50 for a cup of coffee in the morning, I was wrong. I will go back to staying in 3 star hotels now.",nan,1,ex2203
expedia,Was a great experience for our first visit in Chicago. Good location to Michigan Avenue.,nan,1,ex2204
expedia,"Hotel was much nicer than expected for the price we paid. Great location....walking distance to millenium and grant park, Riverwalk, navy pier and even sky deck. The staff was very friendly and helpful answering questions as it was our first time in Chicago. Everything was clean and our room layout was great with great views (we were on 34rd floor). I would definitely stay there again!",nan,1,ex2205
expedia,"I dragged myself up to the reception counter feeling like I had been walking through the desert. The clerk had some cocacola sent up to my room which was fantastic, and started my stay as one of the best I have had in Chicago. The suite was clean with the exception of mold around the inside of the shower stall. The bed could only be described as memory foam - it held the position of the last 500 people who slept in it. It only lacked police tape outlining the spot I slept in. Seriously, had I ordered room service in bed it would have been delivered to the floor below. To their credit they put me in a new room the next day - so fair enough. I slept well and everything was clean. This only leaves the internet. This must have been the one Al Gore created. The ""high speed"" cable and the wireless couldn't wait to start throwing trojans on my laptops - they aren't using protection, or if they are..err... it has a hole in it. This is a show stopper - the connections were constantly dropping. This is the only hotel in Chicago that my personal hotspot wouldn't work.",nan,1,ex2206
expedia,I will return I was pleased with the whole package.,nan,1,ex2207
expedia,A very good stay. Everything was clean and the service was great. Staff went the extra mile. Wonderful .,nan,1,ex2208
expedia,I don't know what material you use for the bed & pillows but I slept SO GOOD! Hotel is wonderful. No complaints.,nan,1,ex2209
expedia,"helpful staff, clean room. great location walking distance from everything downtown. Seems like they could throw in free internet access, and access to the pool at the associated gym next door. it annoys me that nice hotels like this nickle and dime their guests.",nan,1,ex2210
expedia,"Very good hotel, excellent location, and friendly staff.",nan,1,ex2211
expedia,"NIce place, clean, good staff. About what you would espect from a Chicago downtown hotel for the money - pay for everything.",nan,1,ex2212
expedia,My wife and I stayed there for 6 nights. It was very convenient for starting sightseeing because it's nearby the Millennium Park and Grant Park.,nan,1,ex2213
expedia,We stayed one night at the Fairmont. I must admit I was a bit disappointed in the quality of the hotel for 4 stars. It was fine - but nothing special. The rooms were a bit noisy - we could hear traffic all night and lots of noise from the hallway. We ordered room service and it took a very long time to get our food. We asked to have a wine bottle opener sent up - since there wasn't one in the room - and it took over an hour to get it. Besides that - it was fine.,nan,1,ex2214
expedia,"Our stay at the fairmont was enjoyable. The hotel was clean, the room was quiet and the location was great. Walking distance to the parks and many great food options. We really enjoyed staying here.",nan,1,ex2215
expedia,Great hotel and great location. Had a corner room with three windows! Awesome views.,nan,1,ex2216
expedia,Hotel staff was not engaging or overtly helpful. Expensive evening when compared to the overall service and friendliness of the front desk.,nan,1,ex2217
expedia,"Very nice hotel with good location: walk to bus stops, restaurants and Millennium Park. The staff was pleasant and helpful. We loved the fact you can walk under the buildings in the Pedestrian pedway to get to other places without going outside. (AON building)",nan,1,ex2218
expedia,"Expect to pay for everything, even things you don't get. Our suite had a pull out couch for the kids to sleep on, but no sheets. We called down for some sheets and pillows around 9 PM. The front desk said they would have some sent up. 45 minutes later, a second call, answered by the same person, sounded surprised that we hadn't received anything, but stated that they were ""pretty busy right now"". 30 minutes later I called to cancel the request. We took some sheets from the bed, the bathrobes, and some of the girls stuffed animals to make them comfortable (enough) for the night. Not the type of service I would expect from such a ""quality"" hotel. I will never stay at a Fairmount anywhere ever again.",nan,1,ex2219
expedia,"close to everything. Lake, millennium park, best restaurants. Beautiful room!",nan,1,ex2220
expedia,"Very pleasant. Nice room, nice hotel appearance. Central location. Overall awesome.",nan,1,ex2221
expedia,"Very good hotel in a prime location. Great privacy and professional staff. But be very careful with your directions to this hotel. If you are driving with your GPS, please be informed that for security reasons, the GPS signals are scrambled to 1 1/2 blocks. Write the down the directions from the mapping software of your choice as you enter the downtown area. I could see the building and struggled to navigate to it eventhough I have significant driving experience in NY, San Fran, and Boston downtowns. The other reason is there are multiple layers of traffic which could confuse you. I had to take one u-turn in the wrong location (safe though) to reach this hotel. The hotel did NOTHING to help me TIPS. If you manage to get there they will take care of it. The vallet parking worked perfectly. No issues.",nan,1,ex2222
expedia,"great accomadations,friendly courteous staff and convenient central location in South Streeterville.Room was spacious and immaculate. Would highly recommend. Hope to be back next time on business.",nan,1,ex2223
expedia,We were in Chicago for a 2 night stay and the Fairmont was perfectly placed for us. It is close to all of the attractions and numerous L stations. The beds were super comfortable and the room was a fantastic size for the 2 of us. Would definitely stay there again.,nan,1,ex2224
expedia,Loved it. Only complaint was a surging water pressure in shower. Was on 36 floor so that might explain why,nan,1,ex2225
expedia,We loved the central downtown location for our sight seeing vacation. The staff was helpful pleasant and completely accommodating! The valet parking worked well for us when staying in Chicago or visiting family just outside Chicago. The food in the restaurant and room service were very good. The room was clean comfortable and the layout worked well especially with 4 adults. The separate water closet (toilet) and big closet gave the extra space we needed. The shower water pressure could have been better and the beds could have been bigger though both worked well for us during our stay.,nan,1,ex2226
expedia,"Overall our stay was very satisfactory. It was, however, very disappointing that our room was available at the regular check-in time. We arrived around 12:00 PM and our room was not available until 5:00 PM. We were in town for a bachelorette party and ended up having to order dinner in our room instead of going out so everyone had time to get cleaned up and ready for the evening.",nan,1,ex2227

expedia,Walking across bridge at Wacker to so many sites and restaurants . Parking at Prudential Plaza with great ease! Rooms and Facility a true get away!,nan,1,ex2232
expedia,"The Fairmont Hotel is a pretty nice hotel. The location was great for us, within walking distance to the Millenium Park train station, as well as Navy Pier and other sites we were looking to visit during our stay. I gave 4 stars only because there was an upcharge for everything you expect a hotel to supply for you. There was even an upcharge if you wanted a refrigerator, and to drink the coffee that is generally supplied in hotel rooms. I suppose its a way to keep the cost of the room down, but it just seemed a little silly. All in all, we had an enjoyable stay at Fairmont, though it wasn't enough to bring us back for future stays.",nan,1,ex2233
expedia,"My husband and I stayed for four nights in April. We had a great view of the lake from our room. The hotel was clean and well-maintained. It's in a great location--we flew in and didn't rent a car, and we found it easy to talk or take transit everywhere we wanted to go. We would definitely stay again.",nan,1,ex2234
expedia,"Close to Millennium Park, Soldier Field and many other tourist sites. Good price for a very nice hotel",nan,1,ex2235
expedia,"Our room was comfortable enough and the staff was friendly, but it seems dated compared to other hotels we've stayed in recently, particularly for the price!",nan,1,ex2236
expedia,"The staff was not very helpful and to be honest quite rude. I had an upgrade certificate that they would not honor and put me in probably the worst room they could find with 2 double beds...I called to request a king since I am 6'4"". I will not be going back to this hotel.",nan,1,ex2237
expedia,"Very polite, friendly staff. The rooms are 5 star! I'll be returning back here next time I'm in Chicago.",nan,1,ex2238
expedia,"Staff was incredibly helpful and prompt with all requests. Concierge offered great dining recommendations and took care of all reservations. Room was simple and elegant. Couldn't have asked for more, especially for the price in downtown Chicago.",nan,1,ex2239
expedia,"Deal booked on Expedia for flight and hotel combined. Nice hotel, excellent location, very friendly and helpful staff. Clean room, decent view from the 29th floor. For the price they charge nothing is included, just the basics. No free Internet, no free WiFi, mini-bar extra (alcohol expected), expensive parking @ $65/day, however including in & out privileges. Room a bit dated but comfortable. Overall a pleasant experience, I would return with no hesitation and recommend Fairmont to anyone visiting Chicago.",nan,1,ex2240
expedia,"Great location, excellent customer service. Clean room.",nan,1,ex2241
expedia,We had a great one night experience. We arrived early and there was a room available for us! Excited to freshen up before a day at Wrigley Field!,nan,1,ex2242
expedia,"A/C filter hadn't been changed in so long that the dusk had clogged the A/C unit itself. Not a problem unless you like cold air or have a dust allergy. VIP room does not include luxury suites (unless they are on floors 15-18). For $450 bucks a night you would think I could get a ""free"" cup of coffee and a croissant. Also, add $5 to the price of the room, but DO NOT charge me to log on to your wi-fi. It's like charging to use the color on the TV. Being nickled and diming is NOT how I like to spend weekends away. Such great potential, just not quite there.",nan,1,ex2243
expedia,"The room was in need of repair, the tub dripped constantly, grout was missing all over the tile, paint pealing on several walls, and the room was next to the elevator so we listened to every guest come and go!. Do not order water without looking at the price! $18.00! Food is not as described and if you have a restricted diet; don't eat at the restraint in the hotel!",nan,1,ex2244
expedia,"The hotel is located close to the parks, and museums, but leaves a lot to be desired. The lobby is nice, but the rooms are not that clean, and are not well equipped. Are room only had 3 drawers for our clothes, and the toilet was dirty upon check in. When we called to have it cleaned, the manager told us that the staff was eating and they will get to it after their break, not the answer I expected. There are too many nicer hotels in the area, so I will never stay there again.",nan,1,ex2245
expedia,"This was a perfect central location to everything we wanted to do/see while in Chicago. It was within a 2 mile walk to Navy Pier, FirstMerit Bank Pavilion, Millennium Park/Grant Park, and lots of a great restaurants. There are always cabs waiting when needed, and it was only about a $10 cab ride from where the MegaBus drops you off downtown. We will be staying here again! The only problem we had was our air conditioner did not work in our room even after calling twice to have it repaired.",nan,1,ex2246
expedia,"My husband and I had a wonderful stay at the Fairmont Chicago at Millennium Park the weekend of the 4th of July. Upon arriving the Bellman so attentively approached us for our bags. The front desk check in was extremely hassle free and very accommodating. All of my special requests were granted (a nice view and high up). We were on the 25 floor and the view was great. The room was pretty large and the comfort of the room was great. We will definitely return for our annual visit to Chicago. We loved our stay at the Fairmont Chicago, and highly recommend staying there. Oh.. and the sushi in the Aria lounge was simply delicious! Our stay was lovely.",nan,1,ex2247
expedia,I was able to check in earlier than expected. The room was exceptional. It was close enough to Navy Pier so I could walk there and back to enjoy the 4th of July festivities.,nan,1,ex2248
expedia,"The Fairmont's location was perfect for what I wanted to do in Chicago. I was able to walk to Navy Pier, the museums, aquarium, planetarium, and the parks.",nan,1,ex2249
expedia,Had a great time at the Fairmont - some confusion at check-in but overall and excellent hotel and location!,nan,1,ex2250
expedia,Over the years we have stayed at the Fairmont 14-15 times. When you can get a good rate it is the best bargain in Chicago.,nan,1,ex2251
expedia,I like the Fairmont. Nice room layout with dressing area off of the bathroom. Everything might need a fresh coat of paint and a little steam cleaning. Love the soap line they carry. Hotel coffee should be free though! And so should wi-fi!,nan,1,ex2252
expedia,"Nice hotel with great location. Restaurant is very expensive, even for breakfast. Towels could be a little better quality for the price.",nan,1,ex2253
expedia,"We had never stayed at this Fairmont before and were extremely impressed with how beautifully appointed our room was. This was perhaps one of the most comfortable and nicest rooms we have rented in all of our travels, and we travel quite extensively. Moreover, the staff was very courteous and helpful. We would definitely stay in this hotel again when coming to Chicago.",nan,1,ex2254
expedia,"I was disappointed that there was an upcharge for almost every amenity -- even water. The hotel, however is convenient and the rooms are well appointed and comfortable.",nan,1,ex2255
expedia,"The Fairmont is a good group hotel but expensive for the level of guest experience. It is large and very impersonal. If you are looking for a more personal experience, there are many more interesting hotels in Chicago that can be easily explored on line.",nan,1,ex2256
expedia,Pleasant & comfortable!,nan,1,ex2257
expedia,The Fairmont was the PERFECT location for us to enjoy a Chicago weekend! Walking distance to everything we wanted to do! We parked our car at a nearby garage and didn't pick it up until the weekend was over. (it's cheaper to not valet park it if you aren't going to need a car during your stay) The bathroom was an extra bonus as it was unlike most hotel bathroom layouts. Their is a separate shower from the bathtub and the toilet area was separate with it's own door which allowed for extra privacy when people were getting ready at the same time. We also liked the area just outside the bathroom with a mirror and extra space to get ready. We will definitely return to the Fairmont anytime we are in Chicago!,nan,1,ex2258
expedia,"Upscale hotel, so pricey, but rooms and bathrooms are comfortable and clean and felt luxurious. Was on 32nd floor, but elevators came quickly. Walking distance to Millenium Park was nice. Sushi bar downstairs was fresh. My television wasn't working, and they sent someone up very quickly to resolve the issue. It was a reasonable option considering I booked late.",nan,1,ex2259
expedia,"A perfectly reasonable place - clean, quiet, etc. It just feels a bit dated (we had a King room). The bathroom doors are massively heavy pocket doors, furniture is very bulky (more like office furniture) and our sheets had a big hole in them on the seam. Place was functional - all worked, people were nice etc, but we got room for our 10th anniversary and there was nothing special about this, but nothing horribly wrong.",nan,1,ex2260
expedia,Everything was great. Would stay again.,nan,1,ex2261
expedia,"Really lovely hotel, short walk to Navy Pier, shops on Michigan Ave, Millenium Park and lots of restaurants. We had a great view of the lake with large windows to enjoy the view. They only complaint I would have was our queens bed more like Full-size mattresses. It was a little cramped for my husband and I.",nan,1,ex2262
expedia,"Very nice large hotel, if you are there for shopping trip it's not in a convient location to walk.",nan,1,ex2263
expedia,Excellent beds and pillows a beautiful bathroom and top rate service all located 2 blocks from Millenium Park and the the river. We will definitely be back.,nan,1,ex2264
expedia,"Mediocre facilities. Great locations though, probably it's best selling point. Staff at the front desk can come off as a bit rude and cold sometimes.",nan,1,ex2265
expedia,"We had a great 5 night stay here!! Only thing was they didn't change the linens each night, only once in our 5 night stay! But hotel staff was amazing and hotel was wonderful! We would stay again for sure!",nan,1,ex2266
expedia,Poor food & Waite staff,nan,1,ex2267
expedia,"We were treated well by staff; very polite and attentive. The room was great. The location, being near the Chicago river downtown was very convenient for the parks and the magnificent mile/nightspots. A great place to stay when visiting Chicago for a quick get away.",nan,1,ex2268
expedia,"Beds were wonderful and pillows galore. Marble shower and housecoats amazing. I travel a bit and enjoyed this hotel; its ""extras"" that were part of the price and friendly informative staff. Close to tours, parks and a",nan,1,ex2269
expedia,I stayed at the fairmont without knowing much about the Chicago area. It was in a great spot to walk for food and most tourist attractions. I was also able to rent bikes less than a block away at millennium park (home to the bean and art institute of Chicago). Altogether it was a great stay in a beautiful hotel for a good price!,nan,1,ex2270
expedia,"I really enjoyed my stay, only downside: doors in the bathroom were difficult to shut.",nan,1,ex2271
expedia,"The hotel was nice enough - certain fine details were missed in the cleaning (dust had built up to an excessive amount behind the thermostat, etc.) while the details were piddly, for a fairly expensive room, I expected better. The shower was fantastic, as was the staff, so I cant complain overmuch. Requested a king bed, but didnt get it. This is the risk you take with an expedia booking of course, and the staff tried to make it right with an upgraded corner room, so i'll give a push there. Basically, nothing blew me away, but nothing really disgusted me either. For the money, would likely stay elsewhere, unless location was important.",nan,1,ex2272
expedia,"Don't stay here if you have kids. The food service, which of course is expensive, does not have an appropriate kids menu. Also, there's no pool. The ""spa"" is not kid-friendly. The hotel staff will direct you to go over to the adjacent Fairmont Condos to ""use the pool their."" Guess what? No kids below age 18 allowed during the M-F week. And a ""day pass"" to the facilities is $35!!! Basically, you better just park your kids in front of the TV--Movies are $8.00. Yawn!!!!",nan,1,ex2273
expedia,"Rooms were comfortable, clean and quiet. One of the best hotel experiences I've had in downtown Chicago. The gym was decent for a hotel. Location is okay but a little removed from the buzz of the city.",nan,1,ex2274
expedia,hard to find and get to. room very nice and quiet.,nan,1,ex2275
expedia,"Since this was our first time in Chicago, we didn't know what to expect. From the minute we stepped into the hotel, we knew instantly that our weekend was going to be a real treat. The hotel was top notch and our room ""fabulous."" The view from our room window on the 28th floor was breathtaking. We visually experienced the lakeshore for miles. Couldn't get enough of the view~Awesome. The staff was extremely accommodating and helpful. They assisted with dinner reservations, directions, and suggestions on how to get around the downtown area. They made our first-time trip to Chicago a memorial event.",nan,1,ex2276
expedia,"The Talbot is a great boutique hotel that has that wonderful old-time atmosphere. It is off Michigan Ave. just enough to be in a quiet, relaxed area. But it is close to great shopping. The bar is a pleasant place to unwind. Our room was large and comfortable. The water pressure in the shower (on the 16th floor) could have been better, but that was our only complaint.",nan,1,ex2277
expedia,"The evening crew at the front desk and in he small dining room/ bar were rude, arguementative, and could have cared less in even trying to meet our needs after a late arrival by train. We ended up going across the street for service. The doorman, bell staff and others were nice, but when the night ""managers"" were of such poor quality, we will not return to this hotel.",nan,1,ex2278
expedia,I misunderstood that contenintal breakfast was not free. Only one elevator was working. Hard to get up or down.,nan,1,ex2279

If you are light sleeper, like I am, might bother you hearing the noise -elevator motor noise? - I killed that noise by turn on the a/c.",nan,1,ex2282
expedia,"This was our first time in Chicago and our first time staying in a Talbot hotel. The only reason I rated our overall experience a 4 instead of a 5 was due to the lack-luster wait staff in the hotel restaurant. We had dinner and a breakfast their and both times our waitress (2 different people) were horribly slow and inattentive. However, the food at the restaurant was reasonably priced and excellent. The room was clean and comfortable and the hotel staff was exceptional. I highly recommend this hotel.",nan,1,ex2283

expedia,"Disclaimer: We usually wouldn't stay at this class of hotel and are more used to a rather more 'down to earth' experience. That said, we thoroughly enjoyed this hotel. Very clean, very friendly and just far enough off Michigan avenue to be comfortable. Basil's bar/cafe served some good food whilst being an accomodating bar with helpful staff. Did not try their in room breakfast as it didn't appeal greatly, but it seemed standard sort of fare from when we have (fairly rarely) stayed in similar accomodation. I wish hotels would branch out from (badly) standardised forms for such things but I guess it keeps it simple for them. Overall a great experience. The friendly staff really made the trip and I would certainly stay there again.",nan,1,ex2286
expedia,A first class hotel. The staff was wonderful and the accomodations were supurb. I doubt that the Four Seasons a block away could be any better. The location is perfect for exploring Chicago. Our upgraded room was very spacious and tastefully designed with old world class and charm. The bathroom was huge and featured a large marble tiled showed and jacuzzi tub. Outstanding.,nan,1,ex2287
expedia,A good place to stay but seemed more like what I would consider a 3 star hotel.,nan,1,ex2288
expedia,"We liked the hotel very much in all respects. We were lucky to have a very comfortable suite, but a standard bedroom would also have been good. The location is very convenient: very close to the ""Magnificent Mile"", and a half hour walk to the Loop area.",nan,1,ex2289

expedia,"I am a picky person and one who like service when it should be their and it was. I do not have any complaints. I would stay thier again. The food downstairs in the bar/restaurant was the best filet migoen I have had. Expensive but well worth it. They even offer a late check out of 2 pm, that was great. We ordered room service we both got the same burger and fries and it was excellent and worth the money as well. A huge tastey burger and seasoned fries. One possible issue is the noise from the hallway and or utility room. You can hear noises via the air vent. Like I mentioned before I am a picky person and the noises that I did hear from the hallway were not an issue. The blinds are pull down via string. Their are no big heavy curtains to cover the windows. I like my room pitch black when sleeping and it wasn't too bad. Hope this info helps.",nan,1,ex2293

expedia,"My wife and I live in Chicago and wanted to have a night away. We decided to stay at this hotel since we had walked past it many times and noticed the al fresco diners, turn of the century architecture and great location. I'm glad we selected the Talbot over the newer 'glass, concrete, and steel' hotels. The bar is very nice place to start your evening. The beautiful wood paneled lobby is a great place to begin your morning with a fireside cup of coffee and newspaper. We highly recommend it.",nan,1,ex2297
expedia,"My wife and I shared a suite with our two children (13 and 14 yo). Although the sitting area had an uncomfortable sofa-bed, the management moved us to another room and supplied firm comfortable first-class ""cots"" for the kids. The concierge staff was outstanding, very hard-working, sincerely interested in our satisfaction. All hotel staff were helpful. Although they don't have a in-hotel spa or workout facility, they have a complementary arrangement with a nearby full-service gym/spa. We like the convenience of being about two blocks from Michigan Ave and Hancock Bld/Water Tower.",nan,1,ex2298
expedia,"Talbott offers a very gratifying and satisfying stay. what will stand out is the warmth and personable nature of the staff including the concierge, the front desk and just about everybody who works there.

expedia,"On a business/leisure trip, I fell in love with the 'old world' looking charm -- and many stars -- of this small hotel. On arrival, the doorman, bellman, receptionist and concierge were all lovely and cheerful. Up the elevator, out to a narrow unpleasant corridor to our room -- we were first sent to an occupied room, apologies, up another flight to a roomy corner space. But it turns out the hotel has no air circulation system: an AC for the summer in the wall; for air the rest of the year: OPEN THE WINDOW ON EAST DELAWARE AND LISTEN TO THE TRAFFIC ALL NIGHT! No business center, no fax, no internet service, and when I called to see if I could get a toothbrush, the night manager told me to go across the street to the drugstore! His attitude was sort of ""my way or the highway"".Fortunately, Expedia got us re-booked to a real 4 star hotel, the Palmer House, the next AM, same price, actually even less, with great service AND amenities as well as friendly people.",nan,1,ex2300

expedia,"We had a great view of Lake Michigan! The hotel was beautiful, staff was very nice, and the location is great if you would like to visit the museums. Restaurants in the area are ethnic food- however a nice breakfast restaurant called ""yolk"" is close. We had two young children and they had fun here.",nan,1,ex2319
expedia,"We stayed three nights over spring break with our school aged daughters. There were many attractions and restaurants near the hotel. The staff was very helpful and friendly. The room was clean, roomy, and attractive. HOWEVER, they nickel and dime you to death for amenities. I can't believe they would charge you for simple things like a refrigerator, access to the pool, or wifi. Seriously? An up charge for wifi in this day and age? Additionally, there wasn't a microwave to be found to be anywhere. So, whatever you do, don't plan on bringing any leftovers back to the room that requiring heating up.",nan,1,ex2320
expedia,"Does it need updating- yes. But for the price, service, staff, and location...I can deal.",nan,1,ex2321
expedia,My 6 year old son and I just got back! Pool and staff were great! Wish the rooms were a little bigger it would be great if the rooms had a microwave.,nan,1,ex2322
expedia,Love the hotel. Staff was exceptional. Will be staying again,nan,1,ex2323
expedia,"Wifi is $12.95 a day for 1 device or $25 for up to 3. That $25 also gives you pool and fitness center. If you don't pay flat rate of $25 you get charged each day. My $109 Expedia rate turned into $134 a night. Plus the city an state tax was $42. Parking was $55 a DAY. I realize chicago is expensive but my $253.00 total for 2 nights on Expedia turned into $421.96. I would stay here again because our room had 2 bathrooms, it was clean, and convenient. BUT I will park at the self park lot behind hotel for $13.00 a day",nan,1,ex2324
expedia,Only thing lacking was refrigerator in the rooms.,nan,1,ex2325
expedia,"Staff was friendly, hallways leading to our room had trash, linens and dishes strewn about. Kind of disappointing. Check in was good however, we were asked if we wanted to upgrade to a newly renovated room for $30 more, we declined. We are hilton honors members, so how come if the room was available why didn't we get moved to it with no up charge? I'm assuming that all the rooms rill be upgraded at dome point.",nan,1,ex2326
expedia,"A beautiful hotel with great views of both the city and the lake. Easy access to anywhere in Chicago whether it's downtown or in the suburbs. Great if you are on vacation, but I would not recommend this hotel for a business traveler unless your employer would be happy with you paying $12.95 US per day for Wi-Fi in your room. It's free in the lobby but I think that is not acceptable to expect your guests in a hotel of this size and brand to have to go to the lobby. Maybe in 1995 but not in 2015.",nan,1,ex2327
expedia,"Good hotel but to far from the hot area ( no good restaurants around, you need to pick a taxi ) too big and too old , but with the standard of quality of Hilton",nan,1,ex2328
expedia,We had a great time. The hotel was very nice. People were friendly and helpful. Very convenient to get to the many attractions we wanted to see.,nan,1,ex2329
expedia,"Hilton's policy of charging separate for WIFI and breakfast reminds me about low cost airlines. I don't think an upscale establishment would want to be associated with low cost airlines but maybe that's just me. My guess is that most people have good data plans, so it would be smarter to jack up the room price by $15 provide free WIFI.",nan,1,ex2330
expedia,This is GREAT hotel in a great location. We had a spacious room with a view. Staff was friendly and helpful! Hope to come back soon.,nan,1,ex2331
expedia,"Stayed at the hotel for a conference. Room was nice, gym was nice.",nan,1,ex2332
expedia,Enjoyed staying at this hotel. Very close to the Museum Campus. A long walk to Magnificent Mile. Had to take the bus back because my kids couldn't walk that far.,nan,1,ex2333
expedia,"We didn't get in until 11pm & the special request of 2 beds was just as we had asked. Akoto (bellman) was VERY helpful. He was at the front door & gave us directions to the parking door around back. When I came in the back door he saw me in the lobby & came to help us. He talked with us and my 8 yr old daughter. What really made the stay a gem was that he gave us cards for free breakfast. The breakfast was delicious. (made to order omelets, bacon, sausage lots of fresh fruit, yogurt, very tasty blueberry scones, etc.) The self parking is $55 per day which seems high, but that is the going rate downtown. My daughter wrote a note to our maid telling her that she did a good job. Joanne took the time to leave a note back to my daughter. All in all it was a nice stay in a convenient location. We will definitely consider it again when we come back into town. (In the past we have stayed at Embassy Suites near Navy Pier. The rates are similar, but we had always chosen the Embassy Suites because breakfast is always included.)",nan,1,ex2334
expedia,"I stayed at the lake view room. You can see the view from your bed in different time, the night lights and the morning sun. The room is very clean and the bed is comfortable.",nan,1,ex2335
expedia,Good Overall value- fairly close to McCormick Used near by parking area and was able to park my car for $25 for the whole weekend !,nan,1,ex2336
expedia,"My experience was o.k. I expected a larger room with a better view or at least given the choice of views. We were disappointed that the late night room service menu was very scarce. I didn't understand that if room service is available where did they expect me to eat if there was no table and chairs to accommodate me. I was also disappointed in the fact that the housekeeper was knocking at my door at 10am when check out is at 11 am and when asked what the purpose of the knock the answer was, ""oh, I was just seeing if you were still here."" I didn't care for that at all.. I felt rushed to check out.",nan,1,ex2337
expedia,Pay all that money and you have to pay to park in the hotel parking lot $55 unreal!,nan,1,ex2338
expedia,"It is a beautiful hotel and we were satisfied with everything but one thing. We went for our anniversary and reserved a king size bed but they gave us two doubles because they did not have any king beds left. It made me a little upset but we still enjoyed our stay. The food was great and so was the service. All of the staff were extremely helpful and very friendly. There was not very amenities, for example, they did not have a fridge so it was hard to save any food from where we ate. The pool area was very clean and well maintained and room service did an outstanding job! Pricing for parking was a little high but had reasonable check out times.",nan,1,ex2339
expedia,"Mooi, groot en goed onderhouden hotel. Schitterende fitness faciliteiten met sauna en zwembad. Prima ligging met bushalte voor de deur naar magnificent mile (bus 3) en metro om de hoek (red line). Field museum, shedd aquarium en adler op 5 minuten afstand. Schitterend uitzicht op de Willis Tower.",nan,1,ex2340
expedia,"My partner and I had a nice experience! The hotel had attentive helpful staff and services, and the room was clean and comfortable. It was a cozy little room with a beautiful granite bathroom and a comfortable clean King sized bed. The hotel itself was very ornate and beautiful! Overall, we had a nice experience staying at this historic hotel.",nan,1,ex2341
expedia,Nice hotel but we aware they charge for everything. Parking is very expensive.,nan,1,ex2342
expedia,The hotel was really cool. Very 1920s feel. All the staff was super nice and helpful. Even got an upgraded room. View wasn't the greatest though. The price for parking was ridiculous.,nan,1,ex2343
expedia,Great location for a getaway with friends!,nan,1,ex2344
expedia,"Everything was great I just only wish I knew to choose the side of the hotel that I could have a better view of Downtown Chicago, I was only able to see the side of a brick building.",nan,1,ex2345
expedia,My boyfriend and I stayed at this hotel for my recent business trip. It was a great place. The room was clean and the bed was super comfortable. We stayed in a room that was not recently remodeled but that was by a bother to us. It was still great! The pool was also great. A nice warm temperature and hot jacuzzis! I liked that there are spots for lap swimming or for fun pool time. And having a jacuzzi for adults only was also a plus! I only buses the track part of the athletic club because I didn't want to pay $15 for the gym equipment but that wasn't a problem bc I enjoy running for my workouts. There were plenty of good places to eat and fun places to go around the hotel as well. I would stay here again!,nan,1,ex2346
expedia,Great stay. Took exchange student to Chicago to see the sights. Had a very nice time and hotel staff were very friendly and helpful during our stay. The room with two bathrooms helped greatly with two ladies sharing the room.,nan,1,ex2347
expedia,"This is a fine old hotel. Certainly not the swankiest nor the most modern but it has been providing, and still is providing, an exceptional value for a very comfortable and convienent stay in Chicago. Excellent customer service. I mark it down from a full 5 to a 4 because of the dining offerings. Chicago is a wonderful food & foodie city and the dining offerings and lounge in the hotel are merely standard hotel food. Rather boring and quite over-priced for their fare. Kitty O'Shea's is better than the others but I would still recommend eating most of your meals elsewhere.",nan,1,ex2348
expedia,My husband and I stayed in the hotel for a long weekend.I made a reservation 4 months in advance and asked for 1 big bed for both of us. At the time we checked in they gave us a room with 2 separate single beds. I asked for a change but they said that they didn't have anything else. That was really annoying. The worse part: last day we had to do check out by 11am: at 9am we still in bed and housekeeper start knocking at our door...we ignore her and she came back at 10am to keep knocking. really??? We were out by 10:30am. It wasn't necessary all that. I think it's very disrespectful. I won't go back,nan,1,ex2349
expedia,"Really enjoyed our stay. Had a couple of small issues but they were quickly remedied by the staff. It was a wonderful stay and we would definitely stay again. Perfect location for Shedd aquarium! Taxi rides to downtown area were $10 on average, which was really reasonable. We also asked the front desk about late check out and we got to stay until 2:00 for an extra $25.",nan,1,ex2350
expedia,"Front desk gave us incorrect room information so we went up to the room we were given (19th floor) and found that the keys didn't work. Mistakes happen, but this kind of thing is a major drag after traveling. Front desk should have a bit more attention to detail. Room was spacious and comfortable. Furnishings need to be updated, but were otherwise comfortable. Was strange to have two bathrooms in the double room. Hotel staff should play up the hotel's storied past more, it's quite fascinating.",nan,1,ex2351
expedia,"The hotel itself was nice overall but our room was a lot older than it seemed in pictures. It was clean but the king size room was not as big as I expected either. It wasn't a bad experience, but it just was not as nice as I thought it was going to be.",nan,1,ex2352
expedia,Everything was perfect except we weren't aware that parking is an additional cost!!!,nan,1,ex2353
expedia,I had paid extra for a room with a view but was told that and access to the pool was an upgrade. Not really that interested but was disappointed that Expedia and Hilton did not have the same info.,nan,1,ex2354

expedia,"I was unimpressed by this hotel. It was unrefined, crowded, noisy. There is no lobby seating and the staff was not welcoming. Room service was terrible.",nan,1,ex2357
expedia,"We got a pretty good deal on the price of the room for Valentine's Day. It was on the 18th floor and overlooked another wall of the hotel. Essentially, it was a view of everyone's hotel room windows. Our room was not really updated. It was pretty well kept, but older. The main floor of the hotel was great though. We enjoyed listening to the jazz singer in the lounge. The building itself, and main lobby was beautiful, and in a good location.",nan,1,ex2358
expedia,"Had a good time visiting the attractions, but get to them early to aviod the lines by late morning early afternoon. If your going to vist several get the Chicago pass and save money well worth, I would order it before your trip too. I would avoid the Navy Pier totally in the winter it's brutal. Plan indoor stuff. If you drive I found it better to let my car in the parking at the hotel and take a taxi it's cheaper then driving two miles to the attractions, stressing to find a parking place plus paying if you find open spot. If you a fitness buff either take a break from it or plan on spending extra each day to use the hotel equiptment. A good way to get your fix it to run the staris twenty floors is a good work out.",nan,1,ex2359

expedia,Went for the weekend. Doormen not very nice. Missed a couple small details like no extra blanket in room and no kleenex in one of the bathrooms but overall nice. DO NOT PAY EXTRA FOR WIFI - NOT WORTH IT!!,nan,1,ex2365
expedia,"Hotel is very clean and comfortable with a choice of four places to eat within the hotel. One is a grab and go type cafe with a great assortment of relatively inexpensive items like instant oatmeal, salads, sandwiches, and sides that can easily be taken back to your room or to your next meeting. I have stayed here many times. Rooms are a good size and many come with two beds and two separate bathrooms. The hotel is older and sometimes there have been minor maintenance items like leaky valves in the bathroom that need repair, but overall the hotel is in very good shape.",nan,1,ex2366
expedia,My experience with Expedia was very poor. I booked 2 river view rooms for my girlfriend's birthday. When my party arrived at the hotel check-in we were informed that we do not have river view rooms. We had a view of a brick wall. This was misinformation by the Expedia website. I paid a premium rate to receive upgraded rooms only to find out that my party will be placed in their basic rooms. Such a misinformation is unacceptable. I was not aware that this is how Expedia does business. I surely hope that someone contact me to make amends because I have a very sour taste left in my mouth after this recent experience with Expedia.,nan,1,ex2367
expedia,The location of this hotel was ideal for our visit to Soldier Field for college hockey. The hotel was massive but never got lost or had to wait for elevators. The staff was friendly and helpful. The room was clean and not outdated or run down in appearance. My only comment for improvement is in regards to the provided directions from O'Hare via CTA train. The website mentioned the Blue Line from O'Hare to the Jackson stop and then walk 5-6 blocks. We transferred to the Red Line at Jackson to the Harrison stop. This left us only about 2 blocks away.,nan,1,ex2368
expedia,"Very beautiful historic hotel in downtown Chicago but the room and amenities were lacking. The room was small and if you wanted a fridge in the room you could call the front desk to have one brought to your room for an extra $40.00! I can't tell you the last time I had to pay extra for a mini fridge in my hotel room. The wifi was also an extra charge... The fixtures in the bathtub were loose so every time I turned the shower on I thought I was going to pull the spout out of the wall. Same goes for the shower head. If you wanted to adjust the angle of the shower it felt like it was going to come lose from the wall as well. With that being said, the staff were nice and the pool was nice but cold. The hotel also had an amazing gym but we chose not to pay the $15.00/day to use it.",nan,1,ex2369

The staff was incredibly friendly & helpful! Also about a 25 min walk to the magnificent mile or there is always a taxi out front. Plus the corner bakery is just around the corner ;) *The only thing I would recommend is bringing your own pillow, theirs aren't very comfy (in my opinion).",nan,1,ex2372

expedia,"A couple details caused us to be disappointed in this hotel. We stayed for three nights. On day 2, we had no bathmat and no glasses after housekeeping completed the room cleaning for the day. The room itself was quite small and appointments (lamps, window dressings, bathroom fixtures, etc.) are dated and dreary. Food available at the restaurant for quick grabs in the morning and for lunch between meetings was so-so. Pluses...we love the location and staff are friendly and helpful. Interestingly, colleagues attending the same meeting and staying in the same hotel commented favorably on their rooms...Did we get a ""leftover"" because we booked with Hotels.com?",nan,1,ex2376

expedia,"We really enjoyed our stay. The pool and hot tubs were nice. The location was great. A few minutes walk to Aquarium, Planetarium, Soldier Field and Field Museum. We were tired at the end of the day so we ate at the hotel restaurant 720 South Grill. It was the nicest meal we had in Chicago (and that is really saying something!) Go. Enjoy.",nan,1,ex2378
expedia,"Stayed at this hotel specifically because it was close to Buddy Guy's Legends. Location is excellent. Hotel amenities are excellent. Only issue was that we were on floor 21 and awoken at 9am to the sound of jackhammering on the floor directly above us. None of this was disclosed at the time of booking a room, or when we were assigned a room at checkin. The staff informed us that they are doing a 'complete renovation' which sounds like more jackhammering is to come. I'd stay here again, but please confirm that you are on a floor far from the one being renovated. Also, if I owned a hotel, I'd probably jackhammer say from noon till 8pm, so as not to disturb those patrons who go to sleep early for conferences, or those who plan to sleep in late because they were out on the town.",nan,1,ex2379

That said, no one told us there was massive remodeling going on adjacent to our floor from 8 am-4pm on weekdays, which made for a rude awakening the last day (Monday) of our trip. In addition, hotels.com lists check-out at noon, but the hotel changed it to 11:00. They were nice about it and didn't charge us after we went down to registration because our card had been deactivated at 11, but it was an odd mix up. Our floor was a little dated, but still nice--the renovations look pretty awesome, so I'd definitely go back--I'd just make sure I asked for a room nowhere near the construction, and would verify check out times etc.",nan,1,ex2384

expedia,It was a above average hitel. Although this hotel may not be chicagi's most modern hotel.

I have called and asked to be moved, as this is not what I have paid for. I was told the hotel is full and they will see what they can do about it, but there was no follow up. The atmosphere in the hotel was manic; I was never told where breakfast was served and the staff was not very nice - very impersonal, rushed every costumer; trying to get reception on the phone was a hassle as nobody answered (i was on hold for more than 10 min).",nan,1,ex2401

Not really my style -- $69 per day parking plus $24 eggs for breakfast. Something to do once in a lifetime but anyone with an ounce of frugality will find it painful to stay here.

In fact, both were hidden away (coffeemaker in a pull-down panel beneath the TV, and the hair dryer in a knapsack hanging on the back of the bathroom door). It would have been nice to have that mentioned at check-in. I was a little confused by Kitty O'Sheas being closed the night of my visit. I had dinner in the lounge then, and it was quite pleasant - the food delicious and very good service. The food in the deli seemed quite overpriced though, for example $7.50 for a fancy yogurt cup.

expedia,"Candace, front desk mgr was awesome! She treated us very well when we discovered our van would not fit in the self serv parking garage. Hotel is steeped in history, location is perfect for all the museums, theatre, millennium park, & shopping. We'll be back!",nan,1,ex2424
expedia,"We are very pleased we chose the Hilton for our Chicago visit. The location was perfect for shopping and seeing the city. We were there just before the Christmas holiday and the hotel was absolutely beautiful. It was a busy weekend, a Bears game Monday night during our stay and the hotel was bustling yet still attentive to us as guests. We were provided great service when we dined at the restaurant and snack shop. The bar keep was attentive and knowledgeable of the menu when and had a couple night caps and snack at the pub. Our first evening at the hotel we brushed up on sites with the bar keep who also knew the city and had a nice conversation about Primer League Soccer. I look forward to staying here on our next trip and have already recommended it to friends and family.",nan,1,ex2425
expedia,"We stayed for 3 nights and all 3 nights were very enjoyable! The hotel was very clean, the front desk was quick and efficient and the rooms were great! Check in was quick and the staff was really nice! Our reservation was saved and they offered any changes we might need without problem. We upgraded to get WiFi and the athletic club, which was a great choice! THe athletic club has a ton of weight machines, cardio options and free weights.. the athletic club was WAY too warm, but that was the only negative. The rooms were very clean and the hotel was always in good condition. The staff was very nice also! Negatives- the thermostat in our room was broken and it took 5 hours for someone to come replace the batteries. The staff was nice when they arrived, but it was 11:30pm when they finally got there.",nan,1,ex2426
expedia,"First, the good: The Hilton is beautiful on the outside and the lobby is stunning. Parking was pretty easy in their ramp, and checking in went well and the woman at the desk was very friendly. Our room was very nice, considering the age of the hotel, and we were surprised it had two bathrooms. Now, the bad: Our room was very nice, but not clean--we saw a layer of dust under the entertainment center and wouldn't let our infant play on the floor at all since it pretty clearly hadn't been vacuumed well. Next, we had my mom stay in the next room to watch the baby while we caught a game in town--unfortunately, in her room both the TV and telephone didn't work. Helping to seal the deal that this isn't the best hotel in Chicago is that as I checked out in person (since you can't check out by phone when your phone doesn't work) and told the woman at the desk the phone didn't work, there was no apology or mention of being sure to get that taken care of. While first impressions are important and ours was good, last impressions are also a big deal as we left with a disappointing checkout.",nan,1,ex2427
expedia,Awesome upscale hotel. Service was excellent and I will definitely stay at this hotel again.,nan,1,ex2428
expedia,Wonderful weekend stay. The staff was so helpful and nice. The kids loved the pool and that it stayed open until 10:00 pm.,nan,1,ex2429
expedia,"Overall, the hotel is nice and the lobby is a must see even if you're not staying. The rooms need remodeling. The decor is definitely from the early 80s. The bathroom and fixtures were old and very worn. The bottom sheet on the bed didn't extend the full length of the bed, which I found very odd. Not sure if they used a queen sheet on a king bed or...? The staff was friendly and helpful, except for the concierge. Apparently we annoyed her Highness by asking a question and her response was rather curt. Also, if you drive, they charge $50/day for parking.",nan,1,ex2430
expedia,"Staff unfriendly. Vouchers becos of services not available does not suite guest especially if early check out. Made arrangements with Dough the manager to change vouchers due to early check out, all was agreed and guess what? Get to reception and only 1 voucher for $ 25, when this was a swop for 5 guest who had each had $15 vouchers. I would not suggest booking exec rooms until renovations completed or never at all. Back home in South Africa the service is 100 times better",nan,1,ex2431
expedia,"Very nice, but crowded during the holidays. Front desk staff very friendly. Great rate and included self-parking.",nan,1,ex2432

expedia,Very nice hotel. But felt like we were nickel and dimed. Everything cost extra from $52.00 per night to $15.95 per day for wifi. Very noisy hallway...not the hotels fault just a bunch of party goers.,nan,1,ex2436
expedia,"Nice hotel, needs free breakfast. I will definitely recommend this hotel or stay again. Is close to shopping and parks.",nan,1,ex2437
expedia,Awesome! I only don't get why expedia wants me to write more. Ratings and spontaneous reviews should do the work.,nan,1,ex2438
expedia,"I enjoy my stay at the hotel great spot and location right across from Grant Park. My room over look Michigan Ave and Lake Michigan. I didn't find the internet service user friendly in the room at all,you have to pay for WiFi services. I think internet service should have been included in the stay. It really doesn't cost the hotel any more money to allow ""free"" access to Wifi services. I was checking for things to do in the area just turn it up.:-(",nan,1,ex2439
expedia,"Let me start with saying I am a Hilton Honors gold member. My husband and I always stay at Hilton properties. This was, by far, the worst hotel I have ever stayed in. It took us 30 minutes to check-in because 3 front desk attendants were chatting each other up instead of working through the check-in line. We booked the Lakeview King room, but they bumped our reservation to a non-renovated floor that faced the train. The bed had to have been 15 years old. It sagged terribly, and the pillows were practically flat. The photos they show on the site are the renovated floors, which seems like only 1/2 the hotel currently. If you stay, make sure to request a renovated floor. My husband did not sleep more than 2 hours the night we stayed. The bed was just so terrible, and we could also hear the train go by every 15 minutes. We checked out early and went to the Conrad Hilton down on Magnificent Mile. It was wonderful.",nan,1,ex2440
expedia,"This is the first time we stayed in this hotel, but it will definitely not be our last. The service and comfort were wonderful and the hotel is within walking distance of nearly everything we wanted to see. The only downside is that you have to pay for the use of the workout facility, which was odd, but at least we didn't have to pay for parking!",nan,1,ex2441
expedia,"Chicago was a great city to visit with kids, we took in all that the City had to offer like the Museum, Aquarium, Planetarium and the Willis and Hancock Towers. Followed that up with a Chicago Blackhawks and Bulls game at the United Centre. I would recommend this Hotel to stay at when visiting Chicago, it is within walking distance to all that Chicago has to offer and the kids enjoyed the 8th floor pool and hot tub.",nan,1,ex2442
expedia,We went with four teenage children and our little dog and enjoyed every moment. I can't think of anything that i would change except the restaurant was very expensive. Feeding my crowd is never easy but wow. The hotel is just amazing and very reasonable. I will come back and would give it 5 stars...,nan,1,ex2443
expedia,"UN HOTEL MUY ELEGANTE, PERFECTA UBICACION BUEN SERVICIO, UN POCO CARO EN CUANTO AL RESTAURANTE Y LA CAFETERIA LO CUAL SE ESPERA EN UN HILTON LAS HABITACIONES MUY COMODAS",nan,1,ex2444
expedia,Great hotel for a reasonable price. Awesome location and beatiful facilities.,nan,1,ex2445
expedia,"The hotel is very old and the room is fairly small. The best part about the room is that it has two bathrooms. During our stay, there was a construction crew working in the morning so that was really loud. Also our AC/Heater was broken. The rate we got was fairly cheap, but that means no WiFi no free parking. The Grand Ballroom is pretty awesome, but we're not on a business trip so that's meaningless for us.",nan,1,ex2446
expedia,Very nice hotel and employees parking is outrageously expensive though but would stay again,nan,1,ex2447
expedia,"Hotel was great. Christmas stay, everything we wanted. Nice health club, great pool. All around great stay.",nan,1,ex2448
expedia,"Newly refurbished room was excellent, nicely quiet, and I was given a free upgrade with extra room. Staff is always friendly and helpful. Loved the music at Kitty O'Shea's as usual - you can never get enough of Jimmy Moore and Pat Broaders - and I would choose to stay here just because of them!! While not as glitzy as some of the Mag Mile inns, the Hilton is still my favorite spot - comfortable and elegant without the pretentiousness.",nan,1,ex2449
expedia,This was my second stay at the Hilton Chicago. I chose it again because it's an absolutely gorgeous hotel and I love the convenience of most rooms with 2 bathrooms - a wonderful luxury with 2 women and 2 teenage girls in the room! It also offers a large gift shop that came in handy when I had to emergently buy another pair of tights for my daughter when hers got a run. I would highly recommend this hotel!!,nan,1,ex2450
expedia,"The Chicago Hilton is ""the"" grand hotel of the city. We stayed on Monday-Tuesday night, to visit various museums during the day. The hotel common space is splended for any era, and the Christmas decorations along with the Debutante Ball were wonder to witness. The rooms are indeed old, and have acquired the commensurate character over the decades. The only downside is the hotel suffers from the economic model of many large, urban properties, and finds it necessary to charge for things we assume would be free. Parking was $70 per day, the wireless (low-speed) internet as $13 per day, etc. Over all a great stay, and we will book there again for our next museum trip.",nan,1,ex2451
expedia,We visited Chicago for a Bears game and this hotel was one of the closest to the stadium. The hotel is in a great location downtown and is near tons of restaurants. The hotel decor was beautiful and the Christmas tree in the front lobby was breathtaking. We will friendly definitely stay here again the next time we're in Chicago. The staff was very friendly and welcoming.,nan,1,ex2452
expedia,"Everything was great, except the cost of parking the car was almost as much as the room. I did spend time here while a college student at the Midwest. It brought back many memories.",nan,1,ex2453
expedia,"While the hotel guest rooms themselves could use some updating, the hotel itself is beautiful!! We stayed with our two girls, ages 7 &11. They stated numerous times that they felt like royalty. That's how the staff and atmosphere makes you feel your entire stay. We absolutely will be staying here again! Thank you Hilton Chicago for making our Christmas vacation so memorable!",nan,1,ex2454
expedia,Room wasn't clean and they lied to us they cleaned it again. Then said since we booked through expedia they wouldn't do anything for us. Are we still not guests there?!?!?,nan,1,ex2455
expedia,"Parking was $52 per day- in the heart of Downtown Chicago, fortunately we found great places to visit at walking distance. We loved the facilities.",nan,1,ex2456
expedia,Location was good hotel was nice but the room was so small,nan,1,ex2457
expedia,"Hotel is beautiful and historic. Many events were being held at the property during our stay. Was with a business partner so we really enjoyed the double bed room with two bathrooms. First time I had stayed in a room configured this way and was really good for our situation. No complaints other than we got stuck on the elevator briefly on check in, but the staff rectified within a minute or so (glad not claustrophobic) and I unfortunately left by toothbrush at home and asked for a complimentary one. Staff indicated that was no problem, but after visiting desk three times and one could not be produced there at which time I was assured that it would be sent to the room, it never arrived. Otherwise, a top rate property that was enjoyable. Parking is outrageous though.",nan,1,ex2458
expedia,Booked a king size room for a very special occasion and gave me a double bed room. Ruined my stay. Never cleaned the room in 3 days. Bad bad experience.,nan,1,ex2459

expedia,"It was nice and comfortable. Nice view, but I would've like to be able to stay in a higher floor",nan,1,ex2461
expedia,"Went to Chicago for the CBE Classic this past weekend. Arrived later than expected and was greeted wonderfully. It was late so the staff took our luggage to our room for us, had an express checkout so we could get settled quickly. Woke up and ate at the buffet which was very good with a great selection. Took about 10 seconds to get a cab in front of hotel which was outstanding! Great location on Mich Ave, if it was nice out you could walk to most destinations but not terribly pricey in a cab. Went to United Center and it was only $10.",nan,1,ex2462
expedia,Toilet was broke but hotel was extremely accommodating. Would definetly stay again.,nan,1,ex2463
expedia,Great hotel room with 2 bathrooms. Worked great having 2 couples. Perfect view of the lake. Our bellhop was very informative!!,nan,1,ex2464
expedia,I was in town for the weekend to attend both a Blackhawks and a Bears game. I've had good luck with Hilton Hotels before and thought I'd give this one a try. Over all the hotel is very impressive and gives you that feel of a bygone age. Loved,nan,1,ex2465
expedia,"Bathroom was old and cold , the wall heater was not working in the winter",nan,1,ex2466
expedia,The staff are incredible! Especially the housekeeping people!!!,nan,1,ex2467
expedia,The Chicago Hilton is awesome! Close to all the main attractions. Will definitely stay here again!,nan,1,ex2468
expedia,Great staff. The room was nice and the bed comfortable. The Hilton has a top notch exercise center and multiple restaurants to eat at right in the lobby. Coffee shop too. I would stay again in a heartbeat.,nan,1,ex2469
expedia,"Very nice room, with a great view! Overall, hotel is starting to show some minimal wear and tear, but still a very nice stay in the heart of downtown Chicago.",nan,1,ex2470
expedia,We got the double bed with the two bathrooms. Everything was good. It is a old hotel so I expected some out of date things. But overall my friends and I were happy and we enjoyed our stay. All of the staff was nice and helpful! The lobby is huge and beautiful. They even have a luggage drop off if your flight is later than the check out! The hotel was a good distance to everything. We used the subway and bus and taxi equally.,nan,1,ex2471
expedia,"Everything was great, except.... 1) The toilet lid won't stay open on its own. What am I, a woman? Let me go #1 like the manly man that I am. 2) The coffee machine gave 3 coffee packets, 1 coffee cup and 1 coffee creamer. A little odd considering that I asked for two beds (aka a minimum of two people).",nan,1,ex2472
expedia,"Don't stay at this hotel! The service is ridiculous and I was overcharged for service that I didn't use! I've called them multiples of times to fix this problem, not nothing was resolved.",nan,1,ex2473
expedia,"Stayed for a Bears game. Hotel was excellent value for price (especially if you don't park like we did, parking adds another $45). Room was spacious, clean, and the location was fantastic. Not sure if this is every night or just after Bears games, but they had added security of security guard that required you show your room key before accessing the elevators when we returned after the game. Walking distance from South Shore line, Soldier Field, Field Museum, Mag Mile and a ton of restaurants and shopping. Will Def stay there next time we go up for a game. Hotel lobby area was gorgeous.",nan,1,ex2474
expedia,"I can't sum up how bad this place is in 15,500 words",nan,1,ex2475
expedia,"Did a weekend getaway with my sister and had a fabulous time! The hotel is gorgeous, well-decorated and VERY clean. The staff was very polite and attentive. I feel like we got a very reasonable rate through Hotels.com and I'd absolutely stay there again. The Christmas decorations made the place especially fancy and charming!",nan,1,ex2476
expedia,Ok. Had better experiences in hotels that would be considered less than. The HILTON,nan,1,ex2477
expedia,"I've always been a fan of this Chicago Hilton,but hadn't had occasion to stay there in recent years. Glad I made it back! I was celebrating a special birthday this year and the staff there made it feel very special. Funny thing was though, I never told anyone about it! That says it all. From front desk to bell man, bartender to waiter, housekeeping to room service...all the way up and down the line, staff were responsive, friendly and energetic. Kind of an old-fashioned cordiality, which really is 'the Chicago Way'. Very nice to experience. Thank you all. If you are looking for a place to stay in downtown Chicago, a little south of the frenzy of River North, but still accessible to all the great places/things that Chicago has to offer...do yourself a favor. Book here. You'll enjoy it.",nan,1,ex2478
expedia,Good location. Great hotel for the price.,nan,1,ex2479
expedia,Terrible wait to check in. Appears they were under staffed. The staff did not have any sense of urgency to get customers checked in. Went back to the check in desk to get another key for my room and had the same 30 minute wait. will not return.,nan,1,ex2480
expedia,"Very nice hotel, and beautifully decorated for Christmas!!",nan,1,ex2481
expedia,"This is a beautiful hotel filled with rich history. It has a business center, great workout facility, and multiple dining options. However, the room was very small for a family. We selected a room with two bathrooms, and although it was architecturally interesting, the desk and dresser in there were much too big for a family. The dining options in the hotel were rather expensive for a family, too. I'll bet business travelers love this place, though, because the rooms are super-quiet and the beds, although small, are comfortable. Couples would probably appreciate the sophisticated appointments, too.",nan,1,ex2482
expedia,"The rooms view wasn't spectacular, but we were only using the room to sleep in, so that didn't matter. Having 2 bedrooms AND 2 bathrooms was great! My friend and I could easily get ready-which could be challenging for two females. Ample space in the room with desks and chairs.",nan,1,ex2483
expedia,Absolutely loved it! The hotel staff was very accommodating and the location was perfect for getting out and site seeing.,nan,1,ex2484

You can walk to anything in town.Room was clean but the blower on the heating unit was making a high pitch noise. Pool area was clean. Over all nice stay for $99. Make sure to check other parking if your driving. Easy off and on to the toll.,nan,1,ex2488

expedia,"I really enjoyed my stay here ,I had a lovely room which overlooked the park and the lake .Everything was clean and comfortable and had everything I needed for my stay ,including nice high-end toiletries It's an easy walk to all of the sights and shopping. It was also easy to access the ""L"" ,just a short walk away ,which made returning to Midway airport much cheaper than by taxi. I didn't eat dinner at the hotel ,but I did have breakfast which I ordered from the a la carte menu .Everything was perfectly cooked and really well presented. I certainly would stay here again ,it's a great hotel.",nan,1,ex2491

expedia,Great staff! Great hotel and location for the money. Park at the self park a block away for 24$ a day.,nan,1,ex2493
expedia,my only complaint with my experience came as I was going to drive out of the parking lot. I had purchased a room with free parking. As I was leaving the gate wouldn't go up. I don't know if something went wrong with the validation or what. An attendant finally let me out after checking my I.D. I'm still waiting to see if my charge card is going to be billed.,nan,1,ex2494
expedia,"Hotel was nice,but would not let us check in early. I am guessing because we went through a third party site. Others we able to check in like the many people in front of us. We were also given the wrong room and when asked to get the right room they said no problem. Good thing it was after check in time. The front desk said they would call me when my room was ready which never happened. Over all nice hotel nice staf. I just wish hotels like this would treat everyone the same no matter which site you book them trough.",nan,1,ex2495
expedia,"This hotel is great. The staff was awesome. The atmosphere is out of this world. If you are looking for a modern hotel then I would suggest you look else where. If you are looking for nostalgia, then you have come to the right place. The history of the hotel makes it worth the price. The location makes it all worth while. We ate at Kitty O'Shea's and the food and service were off the charts. If you read a negative review on here it must have come from someone with a bad attitude.",nan,1,ex2496
expedia,"Hotel was a little farther from the heart of the city than anticipated. No microwave, wet bar, or fridge in the room. Entrance was beautiful, room was outdated and the first night I was not given a comforter. Just a sheet and thin blanket. Was told comforters were in ""high demand."" Really? Would not stay here again.",nan,1,ex2497
expedia,"Room temperature was uncomfortable and thermostat did not work. Room had water damage on the ceiling, wallpaper peeling, dirty bathroom and very thin walls.

Location was excellent but the hotel left a lot to be desired.",nan,1,ex2498
expedia,"The room was very dated and had no mini fridge and the exhuast fan did not work in our bathroom. It was very clean and the rest of the hotel was amazing. I was let down by the room deocr and the lack of ammenties such as wifi. I would stay again, if the price for a newer room is comparable to others in the area. Overall a great experience with the staff just underwhelmed by my room.",nan,1,ex2499
expedia,"Great atmosphere, very upscale with good service. The in-house cafe and restaurants are a nice plus. Add-on costs for wi-do and fitness club are annoying and excessive.",nan,1,ex2500
expedia,"The location of the hotel was perfect for our trip! Easy walking distance to everything we needed and wanted (Christkindlmarket, State Street, Michigan Ave, etc.) plus great views!. My husband and I along with are two young children (ages 5 & 8) were only staying in the downtown area for one night so the room served it's purpose. The common areas are very well presented; a bit outdated but very charming. The rooms though were definitely outdated but functional. What's not to love about TWO full baths. The rooms are on the small side but for a night or two, it's perfect. Any more than that and we would have been uncomfortable. The check-in staff was very nice and answered all our questions without feeling rushed. I read somewhere on another review that they were charged to use the pool....we were not. The pool area was very roomy and clean. The one thing that really was a turnoff was their charge for Wi-Fi. In todays' day and age I thought that was odd. Other than that, we'd definitely stay again but would have to upgrade the room.",nan,1,ex2501
expedia,"We had a number of problems but fortunately after talking to the right person they were all resolved. Problems started with some mistakes in our reservations which led to other things such as not getting our room cleaned, but the hotel worked things out. Although we were initially very frustrated, we will probably stay there again because the staff really seemed interested in making sure we had a positive experience and made a commitment to good service so we would want to come back again.

We head to the city for a football game every year and the location is perfect for our stay.

We ordered one queen br, but they changed for 2 king br for free at the counter. walkable distance to subway, field museum and quad. facilities are very clean and new.

Personally ran into several chicago bears football members. Along with the hotel and people it put this place over the top.,nan,1,ex2510

Restaurant staff in general was truculent at best. Internet was not free and the charge at $15.99 a day was excessive.",nan,1,ex2511
expedia,neighborhood nice enough but kind of out of the way. Also our reservation was messed up. Got an email from hotel.com reminding me of our stay. Got to the hotel and there was no reservation. Had to go to another persons room call hotel.com and after what seemed like about 10 minutes we finally got a confirmation number and were able to check in. The person at hotel.com was very nice and did all she could. The hotel was also very nice in accomodating us in this situation,nan,1,ex2512

Housekeeping didn't do much except make the beds. Dirty towels left, tables not cleaned off, dirty glasses left and no clean glasses left. Had to call and wait about 45 minutes for them to come up to room with clean ones. Beds were comfortable and the adjoined self-parking is very convenient. Not the best place we've stayed in Chicago but certainly not the worst. About a 10-15 minute walk to shopping on State Street.",nan,1,ex2526

The friendly staff, great service, convenient location and fantastic accommodations made the trip that much better! Next visit to Chicago will include a stay at the Hilton!",nan,1,ex2527
expedia,"The lobby was beautiful right when you walk in, friendly staff! Our room was very small and not as pretty as the lobby. the snack area in the lobby is wonderful! So much to choose from.",nan,1,ex2528
expedia,The building is beautiful and the location is one of the best in the city. That being said it was one of my least enjoyable stays in Chicago. The beds seemed to be old style spring mattresses that had seen better days and the shower was barely warm. The dog (WTH?) next door barked to much and their seemed to be whatt sounded like a freight car pass over our room for our entire stay.The towels had seen better days as well.,nan,1,ex2529
expedia,"We stayed 4 fabulous nights for our long delayed honeymoon. The grand old hotel was beautiful and wonderful. We had a lake view that was amazing, seeing the Adler, the Shedd, and the Field museum on one side, and Navy Pier the other!! WOW! The Athletic Club had a nice lap pool. The staff was friendly and helpful. The only downside was our room was too hot. Not the worst thing on a honeymoon in November. But way too warm for comfort.",nan,1,ex2530
expedia,Beautiful boutique hotel with very nice rooms. Staff was very friendly and helpful. Hotel is one block off Michigan so you can walk to many places.,nan,1,ex2531
expedia,"My stay was an augmentation of my wife's attendence to a large conference held in Chicago. The hotel has all the basic amenities and is in a fantastic location for touring. The room is large by Chicago ""Mag Mile"" standards. Problems with the Staff getting the room accounting correct (split invoice reflecting business and personal). We ended up having to facilitate this on our own once we got home. Also, cleaning staff were inconsistent in when they would be doing house keeping - and worse, taking their personal breaks while in our room (one housekeeper was on the phone when I arrived mid-afternoon). We recieved no housekeeping on the last day of our visit - how does that happen (and yes, we used the door tag.). If you want to stay in downtown Chicago where much of what your are interested in is in walking distance to much of what might interest you, this might (should?) be the place to stay. I hope the hotel can see fit to clean up its act (sorry for the pun!) A.",nan,1,ex2532
expedia,"In the middle of Chicago, the Milenorth hotel provides quality rooms and great service. Our hotel room had a nice view and the facilities were nice. Our shampoo case unfortunately dropped off the wall whilst using it, but such things happen and it was taken care of.",nan,1,ex2533
expedia,"Very nice accommodations but the fly in the ointment was the fact that the parking is extra. And not just a little extra. $62 worth of extra. Nowhere was this mentioned by Expedia or the hotel. When I protested this exorbitant charge to one of the young ladies at the front desk I received nothing more than a blank stare. Helpful, apologetic or accommodating? Nope, not here. This ridiculous charge amounts to nothing but trickery & deceit. It's too bad because the place itself was very nice. Bartender and Bellman were friendly and helpful. We plan to return to Chicago a few more times this year. We won't stay there again.",nan,1,ex2534
expedia,I really enjoyed my stay here. Staff was great. Rooms were great.,nan,1,ex2535
expedia,"Beautifully decorated rooms, very helpful accommodating staff.",nan,1,ex2536
expedia,"We stayed for 3 nights and everyday I requested a microwave but never got one. The people assisting at guest services didn't even have the courtesy to call back to advise whether one was available or not, even after saying that they would. To me, this is poor service. I wouldn't consider staying at the hotel again.",nan,1,ex2537
expedia,"A very pleasant stay.. Great location ! It's close to water tower, lake shore, beach, navy pier and the river. Great room as well.. Hotel staff at the reception was very friendly.. Overall very good experience..",nan,1,ex2538
expedia,"Huge room, clean, quiet, friendly and helpful staff. Nice to have a few breakfast choices in the lobby.",nan,1,ex2539
expedia,"Room and hotel was outdated. Chipping paint on ceiling, old decor. Elevators were always a long wait. Great location! It was two blocks from all the good shopping. Very small lobby but there was a Starbucks on site which is a plus.",nan,1,ex2540
expedia,"Nice, clean, affordable hotel in downtown Chicago; within walking distance to Navy Pier. I would recommend it to anyone.",nan,1,ex2541
expedia,"Great experience. Room had a good view, though not sure of others. The rooftop lounge was nice. The rooftop deck was not furnished due to the season and the weather but looks nice. The windows in the room and the rooftop bar were dirty so that impacted the views for sure. Staff at the lounge were delightful. Cynthia at the front counter was FANTASTIC! She helped me with a travel schedule dilemma and saved me money I'd otherwise have spent needlessly on an additional overnight stay. She delightfully directed me to a nice breakfast spot, as well. Always smiling and professional yet very friendly. Taxi service was always within 2 minutes and the staff was always helpful to hail a cab. The elevators were interesting with mirrors but made for a much more spacious feeling, though small. Hotel was in great condition everywhere I looked. The lobby was nice though could get crowded in the morning around their Starbuck's bar. The lobby bar was a bit underwhelming but you could still get a drink. The rate was good. The Museum of Contemporary Art was right around the corner. Steps from just about everything north of the river. I'd stay there anytime again!",nan,1,ex2542
expedia,Anniversary getaway. Upgraded room. Walking distance of everything. Would definitely come back.,nan,1,ex2543
expedia,"So I'm getting better at choosing reasonably priced rooms that are spacious and it seems that a getting a great rate on a ""suite"" is the best option. I've stayed at over 10 -4 star (one 5 star) hotels in downtown Chicago and the standard king rooms were getting smaller by the booking so I tried a suite at the MileNorth and it was great. Not enormous but nice and spacious for my 2 nights. The bathroom was very small though but there was a nice spacious changing area that helped. Overall very nice hotel, room, and staff was great too! Barista in lobby was a nice addition. Walking distance to just about everything.",nan,1,ex2544
expedia,"If you love the trendy aspects of the Thompson but not the price, this is a good, clean, friendly option in a great location. Aside from a dismal fitness center this place is a hidden gem waiting to be discovered. When that happens the price will probably go up! Food was good. There's a Starbucks on site. There's two bars with different feels for different times. The rooms are big enough and trendier than the chains. I found all but one staff member VERY friendly (one girl at the desk seemed like a mean girl from high school). Bottoms line- I'll be back!",nan,1,ex2545
expedia,"This hotel could be perfect with a few updates. The lobby was pretty outdated as well as the room. Having said that, the room was huge, especially for downtown Chicago and we had a King size bed and a small refrigerator in the room. There were a few steps to get down to the room which were kind of a hazard, but overall I would recommend this hotel. You can't beat the location and the price was right.",nan,1,ex2546
expedia,"Food is really pricey for the quality, the hotel is good. Great location, just had little communication on facilities, food or services in the room itself.",nan,1,ex2547
expedia,I was really surprised at how nice room was for the $$! Spacious ... Two tvs ... Two thermostats! Centrally located for walking! Highly recommend from a traveler that goes to chicago every year! Left a tablet in console of valet parked car... Called front desk... Had tablet within minutes! Sweet!,nan,1,ex2548

expedia,"The hotel had a great location and was very clean. However, If you drive, parking will be expensive.",nan,1,ex2551
expedia,Clean and comfortable room in a very convenient location. Roof top bar is only open on Friday and Saturday.,nan,1,ex2552
expedia,It was a very basic hotel but for the right price the location was perfectly located off Michigan Avenue and within walking distance to most downtown activities.,nan,1,ex2553
expedia,"Downtown Chicago has tremendous restaurants but the one inside this hotel isn't one of them. They served me way over fried chicken fingers, and by that I mean tasted, looked, smelled, etc... when I requested a replacement the response was polite but a little odd, ""we'd be happy to but they will come out the same way because it's the oil"". Oh...the oil makes them burned up and like chicken jerky? Maybe you should change the oil AND leave them in a few minutes less...just a thought.",nan,1,ex2554
expedia,"Like everything about the hotel. Staff was very helpful and friendly, room spacious and clean, and was in a great location. Even though the hotel did not have a restaurant inside (some food was available in the lobby bar), there was a great pizza place next door and a lot of other places to eat nearby.",nan,1,ex2555

expedia,We have become Destination Delivers members and have decided every time we come to Chicago (6/8 times annually) that we will always stay here. It doesn't matter if we drive or fly this hotel easily became our favorite after staying at several other downtown hotels. From the time you get there until the time you leave you feel like you are at home. The staff is very pleasant and willing to help you. The location to public transit and many touristy destinations can not be beat.,nan,1,ex2562
expedia,"This is the second time we've stayed at the Mile North Hotel and it is now the only place we will stay when we visit Chicago! The location in Streeterville could not be better. From the moment the doorman assisted us with our bags on arrival until the bellman helped unload our bags into the car our stay was the best hotel service we've had in years. Check-in and check-out was a breeze, the rooms spacious and very clean! The lobby buzzed from morning until evening with great music, a great full service coffee counter, full bar and the restaurant food was so good we ate there twice. Every employee we encountered was super nice, smiling and always helpful. We felt our Midwest roots shine when the afternoon doorman called us by name every time he saw us!! LOVE THIS PLACE!!",nan,1,ex2563

expedia,Very nice hotel. Would definitely stay again. Would recommend this hotel to others.,nan,1,ex2565
expedia,The only problem we had this time was the group partying in the hallway really late at night. We were ready to call but it calmed down after 12:00. I have stayed in your hotel several times because I am a patient at Northwestern and we come up the night before to avoid traffic being that we have about a 2 drive and my appointment are early in the morning. We of course love Chicago too. We haven't had this experience before so I am not totally upset and I don't know how this would be controlled anyway but it truly was rude for this group to scream for two to three hour in the hallway.,nan,1,ex2566

expedia,Canceled at a different hotel due to noise and booked here we were on the top floor and it was super quiet!,nan,1,ex2573
expedia,Our stay was nothing short of amazing! Staff was pleasant and the room was nice and clean. The convenient location made the stay even better. We were walking distance from everything so a car was not needed. Truly a great experience!,nan,1,ex2574
expedia,"It take a decent stab at beig a contemporary modern hotel. However, the room lacked many bulbs that were burned out and the walls were pretty thin so people can easily hear each other. Also another downfall is the surprise charge of ""incidentals"" which means parking. For a two night stay I paid $130 in parking. What a complete rip off. I would have been better off finding a nearby 24/7 parking garage and paid about half the cost or less instead.",nan,1,ex2575
expedia,Very clean!! Our room was great and we have nothing but good things to say. The staff was fabulous. They kept our bags locked away for us as we arrived early and couldn't check in yet and they kept our bags again at departure as our train didn't leave until 645 pm. The location was truly the best and within walking distance of almost everything.,nan,1,ex2576

expedia,perfect location. great staff,nan,1,ex2581
expedia,This was a quick weekend getaway for the local auto show. The hotel's location is prime if you like to be in the mix. We arrived early and there were no issues with checking into the room. I'm not sure when this hotel was built/remodeled but it is very up to date and clean. I will definitely stay at this property again.,nan,1,ex2582
expedia,It was a great location. The lobby however needs double doors as it was extremely cold sitting in the Bistro.,nan,1,ex2583
expedia,"This was a great central location for anyone looking to travel around the city and willing to walk a bit. Just a few blocks from the Red Line and tons of restaurants, easy to catch a cab. Room and bathroom were spacious. After a very early morning flight, we tried to check in early and they charged a $30 fee. Otherwise it was great.",nan,1,ex2584
expedia,"The location of the hotel was excellent. The room in general was nice, clean, and comfortable, although very simple. The bathroom, however, left much to be desired due to the fact that the paint on the ceiling above the tub was cracking and peeling, and there was also mold growing. I did take a picture of it to show the concierge, who was going to show her manager and also maintenance so that they could remedy this before placing another visitor in that particular room. It was nice that there was a refrigerator in the room, but there was no microwave. Checking in and also getting our vehicle upon checkout was lengthy. We would have liked to look out our window, but the window seals must have been broken, because there was so much condensation and ice in between the two window panes we couldn't really see out at all. There is not a large selection of food/room service items available at this hotel if you are someone that likes to order room service or get a snack (we preferred to eat out anyway). Overall, I would say the hotel is okay. We were not in the room very much except to sleep, so since the room itself (outside of the bathroom) was clean and comfortable,the hotel was in an excellent location on Mag Mile, and we got a good price on hotels.com, I would consider staying again. I would definitely research other hotels in the same area though, and it is likely I would try a different hotel for my next stay.",nan,1,ex2585
expedia,What a find! Cute little hotel just off magnificent mile that I suprised my wife with for her 30th birthday weekend. Close to lots of things that we wanted to do and had a great time. I think several updates need to be done but overall this is a great hotel. Staff at front desk could use some training on how to be more friendly and do better with customer service but pleased guest all in all!,nan,1,ex2586
expedia,hotel was modern and the queen suite was very nice to relax in....didn't care for the bulk pump shower dispensers and towels were undersized yet heavy enough to dry off with. Staff was friendly and weekend lounge music was an added touch. Doorman was courteous on arrival but on departure was unconcerned. Would stay there again if price was right at $120-$150 a night not worth $300+ though valet @ $58 a night is tough to swallow but its Chicago,nan,1,ex2587
expedia,comfortable big room. Very conveniently located for Mag Mile shopping and restaurants,nan,1,ex2588
expedia,"My stay was wonderful. the Hotel staff was exceptional particulaly, Whitney and Chris from the front desk. Sam the valet was pretty awesome too. All of them were very courteous and friendly. Whitney went above and beyond the call of duty. However, I do think it is important to make sure information on hotel policy regarding holding funds for ""incidentals"" is reflected on the hotels.com website.",nan,1,ex2589
expedia,"Fantastic location and the room was super modern and comfy. The bed was one of the best things about our stay--firm but not too firm, and I slept like a baby. You can't go wrong with this hotel.",nan,1,ex2590
expedia,"Booked this room at a great rate pretty last minute for a girls weekend. Upon arrival we chose to valet the car-which was rather steep at $58/night. At checkin I felt we weren't given clear information about the hotel. I learned while waiting to speak to someone at the front desk the next day that the bar served most Starbucks drinks and we were not clearly directed to which elevator we needed to use to reach our floor, small details that would have been beneficial earlier on. The room was nice, the carpet seemed very worn, the walls and ceiling needed some repair and in no way was anything dirty it was just older than some hotels. The bathroom was a nice size but had an odd layout with a really small shower/tub combo. While we did have a window, it was frosted so there was not a view. The location was perfect for Magnificent Mile shopping but not ideal if you are looking to see more than downtown.",nan,1,ex2591
expedia,"The Mile North was a great hotel to stay at. The hotel staff, both valet, door staff, desk staff and lounge/restaurant staff were all genuinely friendly and helpful. Overall, we had a great time; however the room we stayed in was a solid 3 star room, not 4. I give it 5 stars for overall experience as a 3 star hotel, and 4 as a 4 star hotel. While it was nothing to complain about, the room wasn't exactly what I was expecting when I booked a 3 star hotel in River North.",nan,1,ex2592
expedia,"Conveniently located to shopping, art and entertainment. We will definitely stay again.",nan,1,ex2593
expedia,"This hotel is very comfortable with the ambience of a hotel in a large Western European city such as Paris or Amsterdam. Conveniently located just off the Magnificent Mile, it is accessible to shopping and restaurants that could keep anyone busy for weeks.",nan,1,ex2594
expedia,"Nice appearance and trendy look, clean room, great lobby bar with a coffee shop, condition of room was a disappointment. Called for service on the shower, twice. No coffee table, even a trendy place would have an ottoman or something. Great place for a weekend getaway but not for a business trip.",nan,1,ex2595
expedia,"Hotel is just off the Mag Mile. It is billed as ""urban chique"" and a wonderful blend of Humphrey Bogart in the lobby and classy modern in the rooms. Great shower. Nice clean room. A recliner by the window and an urban canyon view to the south that went on forever. Close to shopping, restaurants and theatre, (Looking Glass in our case). Northwestern's downtown campus is just down the block, if that is your need. We had a wonder full time, can't wait to go back in warmer weather so we can wander on foot more.",nan,1,ex2596
expedia,great internet,nan,1,ex2597
expedia,For a Magnificent Mile hotel I was prepared for a (forgive me) pretentious stay and experience. What I found was one of the warmest most welcoming lodgings in all of Chicago. Small and quaint with massive modern styled rooms and a guest staff that truly understand the experience is everything and customer service is the KEY to a great experience. I'm a raving fan!!!,nan,1,ex2598

expedia,The hotel is beautifully decorated with a very curtious and helpful staff. Room was very clean and quiet (I was given an upgraded room upon checking in....very nice!) The Starbuck's coffee and snack bar was convenient...so was the bar and restaurant in the main lobby. I would definitely stay there again.,nan,1,ex2601
expedia,"Hotel, location and staff are great. Our only negative is that the only common seating area is in the lobby with direct street access and during cold weather, continuous blasts of cold air hit you in the seating areas as folks come and go. At least the bar is away from the door.",nan,1,ex2602

expedia,"We stayed there to access Lurie Children's next door. The hotel is so nice inside. I loved the room we had, with steps down into it. The small room was designed in such a way that it seemed larger. The bathroom was fantastic with the large lighted mirror. The one and only complaint I had was that the bell hop/door person did not open the door for me when she saw that I was struggling to get my daughter and her stroller inside. There's also no room service, which was no big deal to us since we brought groceries to put in the fridge in the room. They do have accessible rooms, so if you have a wheelchair or difficulty with stairs, you should definitely pick that option.",nan,1,ex2604

Also, for being a guest at MileNorth, we were able to avoid the long wait for a table at neighboring Ginos East on a busy Saturday night. We got to go to the front of the line. I would recommend MileNorth for any stay in the Windy City.",nan,1,ex2607
expedia,"The location is fantastic! Right next door to a famous Chicago pizza restaurant. You are literally a couple minutes from Magnificent Mile shopping district. You also are about 30 minutes by car from Chicago O'Hare airport. As for the hotel itself? Well, it's pretty plain in the rooms. Seems like a motel. You got a shower, coffee maker, empty fridge, microwave (upon request), and a TV. I had issues with the TV and phone. They had to switch rooms bc my TV wouldn't stop shuffling channels, and my phone only worked on speaker phone. In the new room, the cable shows were really fuzzy. Maybe it was just the cable company having issues? The lobby of the hotel is great. Nice waiting area, coffee shop, and snack bar. The hotel staff are very professional and friendly.",nan,1,ex2608
expedia,"When I travel for business I want: clean, safe, quiet, premium bedding, control of the thermostat, and nice toiletries. MileNorth had all of these and not only did I sleep well, I actually slept an additional hour in the morning (bit late to the office but so worth the trade-off from a comfortable room). 18th floor, corner room. The lobby had a social crowd and I suspect I was given a room away from any party-goers, for which I was grateful. Responsive front desk staff.",nan,1,ex2609
expedia,"Arrived at 4:30 to check in, only one employee was checking in people at front desk, a line was backed up, our room was not ready. Rooms were a bit old. Moldings, bathroom needs fixing up.

The room was large and provided plenty of room for us to move around. Our room's bathroom was in need of updating -- tiles were cracked and kind of old, the paint under the sink was bubbly, and the tub was old. The rooftop lounge that sounded so lovely is closed for the winter -- no mention of that anywhere except at the front desk.",nan,1,ex2614

As a negative, there is a roof top bar on the 29th floor that my wife wanted to go to, but it was closed. Probably because we were trying to go on a Sunday night at the end of December.",nan,1,ex2633
expedia,"My significant other and I decided to have a Staycation. And wanted to spend the weekend downtown. This hotel is in the most ideal location. Walking distance to the red line, cta bus lines and all shopping needs. The hotel itself is very urban and clean. The room we had was phenomenal. We had a clear view of the John Hancock building. We had everything we needed. The only down fall for us is that the bed was very hard. That may be just a preference for me and my significant other but we have no complaints overall.",nan,1,ex2634
expedia,Location was perfect. This hotel is not fancy. It is affordable and very clean. Rooms are a little dated but trendy looking. I would stay again as it was ideal to site see and the staff was super chill and friendly.,nan,1,ex2635
expedia,Fabulous!,nan,1,ex2636
expedia,"Everything was good, but wi-fi was terrible. The location is really good for people who want to shop on Michigan AVE",nan,1,ex2637
expedia,Such a great place to stay! They let me check in 3 hours early and room was beautiful. Great price and location was perfect. Will be back for sure.,nan,1,ex2638

expedia,Great place to stay. Right in the midst I the beautiful downtown area.,nan,1,ex2640
expedia,"Great boutique like hotel. Beautiful, modern interior and rooms. We got a great price on the room which made it even more worthwhile. Only wish is that the bed was a little more comfortable! It was a little too soft and springy for my liking! Will likely be back though if we can get a great rate again. Very friendly staff!!",nan,1,ex2641
expedia,"terrific location. 2 blocks from a Corner bakery for breakfast, one block from Mich. Ave, staff was helpful.",nan,1,ex2642
expedia,I've stayed at MileNorth a few times and the hotel rooms are great. Really comfortable and spacious. Location is close to a lot of restaurants and it's a 2 minute walk to the lake. Only valet parking is available and it's a bit pricey. Onsite restaurants are nice for dining however if you're looking for breakfast you'll have to walk a few blocks.,nan,1,ex2643
expedia,"Excellent location in the heart of downtown. Lobby is small but has a cafe and bar for quick food and drink. Good for walking to hotels, restaurants and shopping.",nan,1,ex2644
expedia,"Everyone was extremely helpful. Big selling point was the ""Green option"" if you choose not the have yourtowles washed daily they get you a $5.00 credit to the Starbucks in the lobby.",nan,1,ex2645
expedia,Right in the heart of Michigan Ave. Love the location. Staff great. Rooms very nice.,nan,1,ex2646
expedia,Turn the heat down in the building 75-80 degrees,nan,1,ex2647
expedia,MileNorth was clean and convenient.,nan,1,ex2648
expedia,"Valet, reception , and front desk were excellent . Ventilation in the room was too loud. We would return. B minus",nan,1,ex2649
expedia,Location was perfect for downtown fun along Michigan Ave. Staff was great at check-in and throughout our stay. They were very helpful regarding restaurants and nightlife.,nan,1,ex2650
expedia,"I stayed here for my birthday with my boyfriend.. We loved it! We had one of the corner suites on the 28th floor and we thought it was a great room for the price! All of the staff were so nice, friendly, and accommodating! Would definitely stay there again!",nan,1,ex2651
expedia,Hallways were HOT!! There was a thermostat control in my room which was great to have. Possibly going back to Chicago in a couple weeks and I'll look into this hotel first to stay again.,nan,1,ex2652
expedia,"There are so many hotels in Chicago that you don't have to settle. This hotel was clean but not very luxurious compared to the other hotels I've stayed at. No room service, no pool, coffee shop that's advertised is a small bar/lounge. Room was very simple to me, not impressed at all.",nan,1,ex2653
expedia,"The service was exceptional. At checkin, Yolanda was very professional, courteous and provided excellent service.",nan,1,ex2654
expedia,"Wasn't sure what to expect, having never heard of this hotel before it was featured on hotels.com. Needless to say, I wasn't disappointed; I brought my girlfriend here (and the city) for her birthday and she absolutely loved it. Rooms are a little small, but very well put together and comfortable. Only downside - no pool. But we lived without.",nan,1,ex2655
expedia,Great,nan,1,ex2656
expedia,"Very friendly staff, and the room was fantastic. Beds were extremely comfortable. I love having a refrigerator in the room!",nan,1,ex2657
expedia,Very much enjoyed your hotel. Great location. We liked our King -Suite room a lot. Would prefer the bathroom door be solid and not opaque/partially allowing light thru. That was an issue for the person still trying to sleep.,nan,1,ex2658
expedia,Great location and clean rooms! Also a very helpful staff - definitely would recommend this hotel!,nan,1,ex2659
expedia,Talk about a great location! This little gem of a hotel is right in the thick of things. Great for unloading all the purchases midway through the shopping day. This hotel should be on your list for your Christmas shopping trip. The hotel lobby can get very cold with the large revolving door...so plan to dress warmly for inside or out!,nan,1,ex2660
expedia,It was great the staff was very nice.,nan,1,ex2661
expedia,"Good: excellent location. free wifi (bit unreliable though). Negatives: lifts - only 2; and if 1 goes out of service, its a long wait. Shower is not great. Conclusion: overall, a reasonable stay; but somewhat expensive for the current property features. The staff are excellent.",nan,1,ex2662
expedia,The tv Chanel's and were awful and the tv was grainy. We had room service bang/open our door inconveniently a few times. Overall experience was great though! Would go again!!!,nan,1,ex2663
expedia,"I paid $99 for 2 bedrooms with my friend. The hotel was just perfect. Nice view, nice attitude of staffs. But the housekeeper knocked the door too many times, lol.",nan,1,ex2664
expedia,Perfect location to do everything you want on magnificent mile and around,nan,1,ex2665
expedia,For $69 it was a steal!,nan,1,ex2666
expedia,I came her for a girls weekend. The room was great and in a fantastic location!,nan,1,ex2667
expedia,All the common areas were too hot! Not 4 star,nan,1,ex2668
expedia,"This place was amazing. Room was great, staff was super nice, like really freaking nice. I mean this place was so great looking. I walked into the lobby and felt so underdressed next to the Starbucks, snazzy little cocktail bar, desk of iMacs, lounge chairs and cozy fireplace all while light tinkling piano music played. This looks like a 5 star hotel in Silicon Valley where you need to wait 3 months for a reservation and you can only enter if are a member of some exclusive club. There is a bar in the lobby open to 10pm, a bar on the 19th floor open till midnight, a 24hr fitness floor, and the rooms... Oh man beautiful windows, the shampoo and body wash they give you is gentle on your hair and body, it smells great too. The coffee in the room wasn't bad and the room was of ample size. We had a queen single room. We couldn't have been happier. Then the next morning we came down and asked the clerk about breakfast, she suggested 3 little places near by immediately, gave us directions and said 'Just call the front desk if you get lost, I'll walk you through!' I am in love with this place. I live in the city of Chicago and just stayed there just because, but now I'm going to be staying there a lot more instead of my own home! If you can get the room at a good price book this place. This second. Do it.",nan,1,ex2669
expedia,Last minute trip to Chicago so I wasn't planning to spend alot of money. I was happily surprised. The room was of fair size and clean. Tastefully decorated with comfortable beds. Located a block from Michigan Ave. so you will be close to some action. Whenever I return to Chicago this hotel will be near the top of my list.,nan,1,ex2670
expedia,overall the room and experience was great. I wish the front desk staff was a bit more friendly and that they'd been better at making a parking suggestion because the place I had to park cost $52 for about 8 hours.,nan,1,ex2671
expedia,"The MileNorth Chicago was the perfect hotel for the second stop on my wife's 50th birthday celebration tour. Our king suite was well-appointed and comfortable. The location was excellent -- steps from Michigan Avenue -- close to great restaurants and shopping! The staff was great! I would highly recommend it, and will stay there again!",nan,1,ex2672
expedia,"Nice place for two women travelers. Safe, clean, friendly and welcoming.",nan,1,ex2673
expedia,"I had a good experience here. I stayed two nights. I appreciated the coffee/tea bar in the lobby. Particularly welcome on an uncommonly cold November day. Room was comfortable. Really, I had no complaints. I will go back there. It is a few steps from Michigan Ave and just a block from the Water Tower Place.",nan,1,ex2674
expedia,Awesome hotel. Good time. We loved it. But not the fact that I have to write a lot to complete this survey,nan,1,ex2675
expedia,Very nice great location Friendly staff. Will stay there again,nan,1,ex2676
expedia,"Chose this hotel because it was right by the Museum of Contemporary Art Chicago where we attended the ""David Bowie Is"" exhibition. Hotel in great location, staff all very professional and helpful. Lobby was relaxing area with warm fire wall and cozy seating, availability of food and drink. Beds comfortable, room clean and quiet though not as updated as lobby. Only problem was giant crack in porcelain sink in bathroom, not pleasant to look at, but informed staff and hopefully taken care of.",nan,1,ex2677
expedia,This is our favorite hotel in Chicago.,nan,1,ex2678
expedia,"Excellent location. The hotel was most accommodating.We had reserved a room for the wrong date. The hotel had a room for us anyway and it was no problem. The breakfast nook in the lobby was fast, simple and good. You cannot beat the location just off Michigan Avenue. The rooftop lounge in warm weather would be quite a neat setting.",nan,1,ex2679
expedia,I booked the tower queen suite for one night. It was very spacious and comfortable. There was a queen bed and pull out couch. The pull out couch (located in the sitting area)could also sleep two people. Cant complain. We even had a view of the Hancock. There is also a makeup table right outside the bathroom. That was very helpful to have while I was getting ready for the evening. Overall a very good experience. Great location and wonderful staff. Would stay here again.,nan,1,ex2680
expedia,"Arrived in Chicago without a room, googled and booked MileNorth in minutes of arriving in Chicago. The original Gino's pizza place is right next door. We grabbed supper there after checking in. The staff at MileNorth were very friendly and more than eager to tell us local spots that weren't jusy tourist attractions too. LOVED MileNorth! Not a single bad word to say! I would stay here again in a heartbeat and reccomend it for friends!",nan,1,ex2681
expedia,The bed was terrible. Every time you moved it made so much noise like it would break in half. Not comfortable at all and kept us up through the night.,nan,1,ex2682
expedia,From the moment we arrived the staff was exceptional! We were greeted first by Henry who explained check in procedures and valet parking. The ladies working the front desk were very friendly. Henry brought our luggage to the room and explained all the hotel had to offer. Throughout our visit Henry made sure we were well taken care of. I would definitely recommend this hotel to friends!,nan,1,ex2683
expedia,"It was what I expected. When I checked in, I secured with a card, but wanted to check out with a different card. Well, their cc machine was down so she had me complete a form to run the charge later. Well, they charged my AMEX card and also my bank debit card. They can't resolve this with one call so now I have to call back and speak with the Director or Accounting.",nan,1,ex2684
expedia,When i first got to the hotel i thought wow cool hotel and junk,nan,1,ex2685
expedia,This was a beautiful hotel,nan,1,ex2686
expedia,good. scored a free drink. enjoyed my meal at the roof top bar. disappointed that Wi-Fi wasn't included in room rate.,nan,1,ex2687
expedia,Great location. Love the boutique type hotel - you don't have to wait for elevator! Nice to have Starbucks/ food in the lobby. Drinks at the top bar were way too pricey. Will stay here next time I'm in Chicago!!!1,nan,1,ex2688
expedia,"Large spacious room, would definitely stay again. Super Quiet, nice roof top bar and just off the Mag Mile.",nan,1,ex2689
expedia,I only stayed for one night but I really enjoyed the environment. The rooms are clean and quiet.,nan,1,ex2690
expedia,"I loved staying here, but the room was a little pricey. Overall was a great stay.",nan,1,ex2691
expedia,"I stayed here for two nights and the bartenders was great front desk staff wAs not helpful. We checked out early due to a emergency and one of my girl friends called the hotel looking for me and the front desk staff told my friend all of the personal business and information. I then called Nd spoke to a manager and the her response to it was well thats your problem not ours i then stated if im a guest and checked out and friends is calling looking for me as a privacy act only information that should of been given out was she is checked out and no longer staying with us. There shouldnt be absolutly no reason why my friends knows what happened at the hotel. Now i, currently in the process of reporting the hotel for giving out personal information to outside people who is not registered to the hotel.",nan,1,ex2692
expedia,"This hotel was beautiful and really conveniently-located. It did not have a bathtub, but everything else about my stay was awesome.",nan,1,ex2693
expedia,Old hotel. Dirty room. I would not recommend this hotel to anyone.,nan,1,ex2694
expedia,Very comfortable and quiet room. Great location just off the Magnificent Mile and beside NorthWestern Hospital. Lovely and cozy lobby with barista bar.,nan,1,ex2695
expedia,I had a wonderful time! Quality time with my wife and daughter!!! The hotel is amazing especially the roof top!!! I will return!,nan,1,ex2696
expedia,"Just arrived back from a 6 night stay at the MileNorth Hotel. When we arrived the staff were polite and friendly, we were also upgraded to a bigger room facing the front of the hotel - could not have asked for better. Ate twice in the hotel and the meals were good. Also a brilliant Italian Restaurant next door Gino's East. Hotel right beside the main shopping street, there was also lots of resturants and pubs round about. Close enough to walk to Navy Pier and down to the river. Would stay here again if in Chicago.",nan,1,ex2697
expedia,The hotel is in a great location so close to everything. Staff were pleasant and helpful. The hotel was tidy and clean. Stairwell was a bit small but I am sure that is related to the hotels age. Would stay there again.,nan,1,ex2698
expedia,"Stayed here for a conference at Northwestern University Medical Center. Great location for shopping, with many dining options too. Comfortable room and very friendly staff. Nice to have a Starbucks and a bar in the lobby.",nan,1,ex2699
expedia,"Nice location, great rooftop bar with best bartender (Manny) i have yet encountered. Really made me feel welcome and glad to be here.",nan,1,ex2700
expedia,Attended our daughter's wedding at Germanie Hall. The hotel was a perfect location!,nan,1,ex2701
expedia,Paying $50 to check in a couple hours early to an already-empty hotel room is not service...it is profit-maximization.,nan,1,ex2702
expedia,"Booked and stayed the same day. The room was well stocked, clean and comfortable. The lobby was clean and unique. There is a hospital next door with a parking garage that charges $52 a night self Park or the hotel can valet for $58 I believe. There was another parking garage right behind the hotel/hospital that was only $42 a night which is good for downtown in my opinion. Overall good location and great stay.",nan,1,ex2703
expedia,I was surprized by the pleasant and attractive decor. We enjoyed the location as well.,nan,1,ex2704
expedia,Had a great time,nan,1,ex2705
expedia,"Close to the Magnificent Mile and major attractions, however, the hotel was just okay. Nothing overly great at all about the hotel. Its mainly just in the thick of everything happening in Chicago.",nan,1,ex2706
expedia,"Booked three rooms for 5 nights, for a family wedding. We were able to get an upgraded room that worked out very well for my 88 year old mom. She spent more time in the hotel room than the rest of us so it was nice that she had a chair, couch and table and chairs and fridge. They also let us borrow the hotel wheel chair when we took mom out. Very pleasant stay.",nan,1,ex2707
expedia,Had no idea parking wasn't included. It was $58 just about half of the cost of the stay. Would not have selected knowing that upfront,nan,1,ex2708
expedia,"The number one reason we keep coming back is the rooms are the quietest I have ever stayed in for the price range. I am disappointed in the fact the restaurant is closed... the lobbuy based Starbucks is like a neglected step-child... meaning they were out of a couple ingredients on a Saturday morning into Sunday morning. The rooftop lounge is nice, even if the clientele are a little out of place for what the lounge is trying to be. The maintenance is starting to fall behind, especially noticeable in the bathroom. But we keep coming back and will continue to do so as long as the price point stays the same or, if they do increase rates they put some money into maintenance and reopening the restaurant.",nan,1,ex2709
expedia,"Very nice modern room, clean and spacious. Very quiet on 15th floor. Only downside was the pull out sofa bed was extremely hard. Other than that no complaints.",nan,1,ex2710
expedia,"I have stayed at this location four times, and it is GREAT every time. Perfect location, considering it is for me and my daughter, so we wanted a safe and convenient location to shopping. Only half a block off of Michigan. Great staff, good food when we needed a bite to eat. Spacious rooms, clean, and right next door to Gino's East....YUM! No need to consider any place else.",nan,1,ex2711
expedia,"Really nice weekend. The staff was great, extremely helpful and friendly.",nan,1,ex2712
expedia,Otima localizacao ao lado da av michigam. Perto de tudo .,nan,1,ex2713
expedia,"Mile North is my go-to in Chicago. Great staff (especially Manny at the Bar), wonderful views, and a convenient location. It's steps from Michigan Avenue and next to a Gino's East Pizza. The coffee shop downstairs has a great ambience and is super convenient before a day of meetings or urban exploring.",nan,1,ex2714
expedia,"The employees are wonderful here, as is the location to downtown, Michigan Ave, Prentice, shops...however this time I was in room 609- the gym is directly above me...weights banging down, people running the treadmill on my head ( kind of) way too loud- and its open 24hours...",nan,1,ex2715
expedia,Great!,nan,1,ex2716
expedia,"We came to Chicago unexpected and needed a room. This hotel was nice, reasonably priced. We would definitely come back.",nan,1,ex2717
expedia,"While the rooms have been upgraded - there were still a few things in our room that weren't quite up to par with what we paid per night. Peeling materials from the sink back splash, side table lamps that didn't work. Little stuff, but enough to notice. Also, with 8 rooms on our floor, you would think that it would be peaceful and mostly quiet. Not the case, anytime anyone was in the hallway talking, it sounded like a whole marching band was going by. They could also do everyone a solid and warm up the lobby a little bit.",nan,1,ex2718
expedia,"Were in town on vacation with daughter and grandson. We knew we would be spending long days walking and wanted a great hotel/great room to unwind in at the end of the day. Booked 2 suites and they were awesome! Plenty of room to kick back and relax when the walking was done. Close to many great shopping establishments and all price levels of great food. Staff were polite, knowledgeable and always courteous. Parking ramp across street is very convenient but expensive even with self park. All in all, fantastic stay in a great city.",nan,1,ex2719
expedia,"Great location, between the river and the Hancock Building. Only downside was small soft beds - double, not queen - so not appropriate for more than two persons. Also almost no soundproofing on the room wall so all noise in the hallway was very loud, including housekeeping which started early at 8 am.",nan,1,ex2720
expedia,"very comfortable and modern room with perfect location near Magnificent Mile. Excellent and friendly staff all around. loved the rooftop lounge and restaurant /bar off lobby. tiles in bathroom floor should have been updated with last renovation, but still not in bad shape. Would have liked an easy chair also in addition to the desk chair for seating. lobby decor is very unique and stylish. Direction of air flow from air conditioner blew right on us while we were sleeping. like the idea of having optional housekeeping service and thought the vouchers were an excellent idea. no problems with check in, but still waiting for receipt from our stay. Would we stay again? ABSOLUTELY!!",nan,1,ex2721
expedia,"Lots of choices of places to stay in Chicago, and I go there plenty. Probably stay in Chicago 25 days a year. The MileNorth has become one of my favorite places to stay. Comfortable with great service. No room service or restaurant in the hotel, but many options nearby. I will be back.",nan,1,ex2722
expedia,"Relatively comfortable room - very spacious. Great staff, accommodating and friendly and welcoming. Not great lighting in the bathroom (if makeup is part of your routine) and the bi-level entrance, while impactful, is a bit awkward.",nan,1,ex2723

expedia,Great location. Can walk to almost all sights. Loved the rooftop bar.,nan,1,ex2728
expedia,"Loved this hotel! Easy to get to, very cute room and loved the Starbucks in the lobby. Jessica at concierge was a bit rude but other than that it was easy and nice! Bad view but that's to be expected in the area.",nan,1,ex2729
expedia,"My main complaint is that although I had paid in advance I was charged a daily 'service fee' of $4.95. Why? The amount is small and suggests the hotel like to squeeze a little extra out of customers, assuming they will not complain. I will not stay here again or recommend the hotel.",nan,1,ex2730

expedia,"First time ever in the mile north , and I really like the place a lot I plan to return soon . I stayed in room 1907 and would request that room over and over again it's just that nice. The staff was friendly and very nice. It's a great home away from home.",nan,1,ex2737
expedia,Easy walking distance to Michigan Ave and all shops and restaurants.,nan,1,ex2738
expedia,Lovely despite rain,nan,1,ex2739
expedia,"I've stayed in Chicago many times and most hotel rooms have been nice but extremely small. I was amazed at the size of our room. It was huge. A king size bed along with tv in the bedroom area, nice sofa/lounge area with another tv and a spacious bathroom. It by far exceeded my expectations. It was in an area that was close to all the amenities and the hotel had a lovely cafe/bar that was situated in the lobby. The staff were very helpful and friendly. What I also liked was the option that you could ""go green"" by opting not to have your room cleaned and using your towels for the duration of your stay. We stayed 2 nights and opted to do this as it really didn't make any difference to us. For doing this they offered you a $5 voucher to use in the cafe. I liked this and thought it was defnitely the way to go being more eco friendly. I would definitely stay here again and would recommend this hotel to others.",nan,1,ex2740
expedia,"I think this is a great little find. The staff were all very friendly and personable. My room was neat, clean and comfortable, although the carpet had seen better days. You can't beat the location for dining, sightseeing and shopping. I'd definitely make a return visit.",nan,1,ex2741
expedia,"I very much enjoyed my stay and had no complaints, room was lovely, location great and staff very helpful however.....after my stay I noticed that I had been overcharged on my credit card.

expedia,"The hotel was great with a beautiful location, but I was double charged on my room and valet. That really discourage me.",nan,1,ex2743
expedia,I had a conference at Northwestern. The hotel was on the same block. The Magnificent Mile was one block the other way with multiple shopping locations and restaurants within walking distance. The front staff was extremely friendly and greeted me by name several times during my stay. I would stay here again and would highly recommend this hotel to my friends.,nan,1,ex2744
expedia,Enjoyed the location. Close to all the action and shopping. Roof top bar was enjoyable.,nan,1,ex2745
expedia,Great hotel and couldn't have wished for a better location. Right next to the magnificent mile. We had a signature suite and it was spacious and very comfortable. The staff were very pleasant so what more could you want.,nan,1,ex2746
expedia,Our experience was awesome from the time we walked in the Hotel till the time we left. The staff is amazing and our suite was superb. It was really wonderful having a Starbucks right in the lobby. The beds are so comfy,nan,1,ex2747

expedia,We loved our room and the view. We had a problem with the air conditioning the first night but we reported it the next morning and they sent someone up right away. It was fixed by the time we returned that evening. Staff was friendly and helpful. Would recommend and would go back!,nan,1,ex2749
expedia,Starbucks in lobby and next door to pizzeria for quick bite on the go. Easy walk to Red Line.,nan,1,ex2750
expedia,"The hotel was in a great location straight on to the magnificent mile. All the amenities and site seeing could be located a stones throw away but in the hotel, the rooms were really quiet and downstairs great coffee! The staff were fabulous and could not have done more for us. My husband had an accident on travelling to the hotel and as soon as he walked through the door they has plasters, antibacterial spray and a variety of creams to help him. They also made telephone calls regarding the accident on his behalf. Perfect hotel in every way!",nan,1,ex2751

expedia,"Very pleased, no problems, nice lobby area for gathering prior to make plans for the day",nan,1,ex2753
expedia,The hotel and the staff was nice over all. However the walls are really thin. I could hear the guest next door talking which made it difficult for me sleep.,nan,1,ex2754
expedia,Great location on the Mile! If your parking a car go to Spot Hero and the Huron Superior garage and elevator is directly across the street. Very narrow hotel with like eight rooms per floor.,nan,1,ex2755
expedia,"Very pleasant stay at MileNorth in Chicago. Great location and hotel staff. Close to restaurants, stores and Northwestern Hospital.",nan,1,ex2756
expedia,"We loved it. We wished we could stay longer. Loved the location right off of the Mag Mile.

expedia,The location was fantastic. I was coming down from Milwaukee for Riot Feet and we had no problems finding parking and public transportation to and from bars and the festival. I would stay here again if I can find it within my budget.,nan,1,ex2759
expedia,"This was a quick stay for a business trip, and I was only in the hotel to sleep for one night. I can say that the bed and pillows were quite comfortable. There was a fridge in the room, which would have been handy if I'd stayed longer, especially since Gino's East is right next door. I was disappointed though that when I arrived I was informed that the king suite I had reserved was not available and I would need to be placed in a queen suite. I was charged the lower rate for the queen, but as I was checking in at 11:00PM and looking forward to that king bed, it was a real let-down. The room was clean and a good size, but I couldn't get the deadbolt on the door to work properly, which was a huge security concern for me since I was traveling alone. I ended up jamming the desk chair in front of the door for peace of mind that there was an extra obstacle to get in the door, but that's certainly not ideal. The shower had good water pressure, and there was plenty of hot water.",nan,1,ex2760
expedia,Definitely enjoyed our stay. This hotel is perfectly located for morning runs along the lake as well as shopping on Michigan Avenue. The staff were all very friendly and the room was clean. We had a great visit in Chicago!!,nan,1,ex2761
expedia,"First room smelled like smoke (whole floor did), carpeting was tore up, bathroom looked ghetto. They gave me new room on new floor which didn't smell , but the paint was chipping, room very dusty, and very old amenities. TV looked 20 years old with crappy picture.",nan,1,ex2762
expedia,"My husband and I stayed there unplanned and were pleasantly surprised. The place was cool, trendy, and posh. We would definitely stay there again.",nan,1,ex2763
expedia,"Reserved and paid six months in advance for 2 King Suite City View rooms for 3 nights each. Checked in and got 2 queen rooms no view at all. Inquired at front desk and was told to keep checking back and they would resolve when they could. Checked back the next morning, was told to come back later. Not wishing to ruin our trips, we just went to enjoy the city. I asked at check out for compensation for the difference in rooms, since they did in fact sell my rooms to someone else and was I offered $14.95 off entire bill. Offended, I asked for someone who was authorized to do more and was given an email address. A week later, no response, couldn't be more offended now. Paid for a steak, got chicken, and was basically told that while they were in fact very sorry, it's my tough luck that they oversold. Unacceptable! STAY AWAY.",nan,1,ex2764
expedia,"This is by far the best hotel i been to in Chicago. Excellent staff , very nice people and the most awesomest 29th floor city view with a bar. I had the executive suite and it was amazing! Very clean , comfortable and modernized. Will definitely be stay here again. .... also A+ on valet parking! !",nan,1,ex2765
expedia,"Hotel is conveniently located to shops, Navy pier, restaurants and public transportation. Staff were friendly and knowledgeable.",nan,1,ex2766
expedia,"Booked this place last minute on expedia and was very thoroughly surprised. They gave us a corner room; we requested 2 double beds which they fulfilled; bathroom was wonderful, shower was luxurious, beds were comfortable and we got a great view of the river. Absolutely no complaints; location is perfect- walking distance to everything!",nan,1,ex2767
expedia,"The Swissotel is a perfect place to stay in Chicago if you want to spoil yourself. The room is spacious and the king size bed was one of the most comfortable hotel beds I've ever stayed in. The staff were friendly and very helpful and were more than willing to recommend nearby restaurants and bars. It is right on the river with beautiful views and located right near a number of great places to eat. If I have 1 complaint, it is that at $15 for 24 hours, the wifi is frankly overpriced. Especially given that there is free wifi all around the area. Apart from that, it's hard to fault this hotel.",nan,1,ex2768
expedia,"Would stay here again if in the Chicago area. Elevators were fast and efficient for such a large hotel. Room service was prompt and the food was fantastic. Comfy bed and warm, powerful shower. Absolutely fantastic.",nan,1,ex2769
expedia,It was a great location for my needs. To be close to a recently hospitalized family member.,nan,1,ex2770
expedia,A very nice place to stay in Chicago. Very nice workout area and pool. The room was extremely clean and quiet.,nan,1,ex2771
expedia,"Our stay was a stop over following a long flight. The hotel was within 15 - 20 minutes walk off the Blue Line metro train from O'Hare. We made use of the indoor pool on the 42nd floor. The views from up there, overlooking the Chicago skyline, were breathtaking. As we had an early morning train to catch from Union station we did not have time to try their breakfast. The cab ride to the station was $10, reflecting the distance and time of day. We would stay at this hotel again in the future.",nan,1,ex2772
expedia,"I enjoyed the location of this hotel -- close by without being smack in the middle of the Miracle Mile area. The rooms felt quiet. I enjoyed the gym and the healthy feeling about the hotel. The breakfast buffet was an amazing array of great healthy eats with beautiful berries, yogurt and granola, plus really good eggs, waffles, etc..",nan,1,ex2773
expedia,Most comfortable bed ever. Nice view of the city and chicago river from room. Would stay again,nan,1,ex2774
expedia,"I had a wonderful experience at the Swissotel and I totally appreciate their ""going green"" benefit. My room was comfortable and clean and the staff was extremely helpful. It is also well placed in downtown Chicago. I will be back!",nan,1,ex2775
expedia,"Once I received a swipe card that worked after standing in the hallway 20 min everything was ok. I called from 25 floor house phone and was told someone was on the way right away, 20 min later had to go down and get new card. I asked who I spoke too and of course no great surprise no one knew. Great hotel if the cared.",nan,1,ex2776
expedia,The hotel is close to everything with only short taxi rides to your destination.,nan,1,ex2777
expedia,We arrived late Friday for the weekend. Our car was successful with the valet at the hotel. Spend the weekend visiting friends and meeting new people. Had a great experience.,nan,1,ex2778
expedia,"We used Expedia ""name your price"". Despite our early arrival, the desk clerk gave us immediate access in to our room and he also upgraded us to a room with a fabulous view of Lake Michigan, Navy Pier and surrounding high rises. Really nice since we were paying a discount rate. Staff was very cordial and helpful. The room was very nice and comfortable. The restaurants have very high prices Don't bother going to the Palm Restuarant. The prices are extremely high for entrees and don't even come with any sides. You have to pay quite a lot for the sides also. It's ridiculous.",nan,1,ex2779
expedia,"Great will stay there again, very helpful, kind more than what I expected",nan,1,ex2780
expedia,I was told on checkin at 315 pm that there weren't any rooms available because they overbooked. She said she didnt know if any rooms would be available but I could upgrade and get a room immediately. She said I booked through a third party website unfortunately. I was stunned!!! We argued back and forth until I asked to speak to her manager. After waiting 10 min another lady came to the desk and got me a room. I just could not believe the way the check in was handled.,nan,1,ex2781
expedia,"Checked in very late and was greeted by friendly, professional staff. We were upgraded to a suite which was very nice and enhanced our stay greatly. We went out and came back quite late and again the staff was available and very helpful.",nan,1,ex2782
expedia,"We used a private parking service at half price, instead the hotel Valet service. Room was clean, nice and quiet with a beautiful view over the Chicago river. The guy from the reception desk was not friendly, with a cold attitude. First impression always count.",nan,1,ex2783
expedia,"Really enjoyed the stay and proximity to the things we had planned. If only the Swissotel could control the outside temperature, it would be perfect. Will definitely stay there again!",nan,1,ex2784
expedia,Rude staff very uncomfortable. Stay felt i did not get my moneys worth. Told manager compensation. Was inadequate,nan,1,ex2785
expedia,"I stayed at Swissotel with my mom for a small vacation. We both agreed that the hotel was one of our favorites, and we travel for mini get-aways at least once or twice per year. I requested a high floor and received a double room on the 40th floor with a beautiful view of Navy Pier. I don't think there is a hotel in Chicago with a more gorgeous view! The staff was professional and knowledgable. I enjoyed the pool on the 42nd floor - it was clean and warm while the temperature outside hit one degree. Truly a five star experience!",nan,1,ex2786
expedia,"The room was quite comfortable. A docking station allowed me to play music using my iPhone. As a person who like to take baths, the separate tub and shower allowed my husband and I to get ready at the same time. On an especially frigid weekend, one of the best features of the hotel was that it is part of a pedway system. This allowed us to stay warm while accessing Michigan Avenue via a lower level walkway. Although I liked the elevator system (actually punching in your floor instead of just pressing an up or down button), at peak times the wait was very long.",nan,1,ex2787
expedia,"Well maintained, very clean, inviting staff.",nan,1,ex2788
expedia,"Stayed here for Valentines Day with my wife. Great view of the city and lake. There was a long line for checking in, which was a little annoying, but other than that it was a nice hotel. The room itself was clean, but it wasn't the most comfortable place I have stayed. The bed was too soft for me, but my wife enjoyed it. It was a very plain room, no art or pictures, but at least you have a great view. When I called to order room service, I was put on hold for about 10 minutes, but I can imagine they were pretty busy for valentines day. When I did get thru, the room service receptionist was very kind and didn't rush. We were told it would be 50 minutes for our food and it showed up in about 25, so that was a plus. Overall I would recommend this to anyone visiting downtown Chicago for a day or two.",nan,1,ex2789
expedia,"Came for a one night getaway with the wife for Valentines Day. I used Spot Hero to save on valet parking costs. The hotel had no issues with that. I wanted to arrive early and drop off our bags, by noon but they had our room all ready for us. That was a pleasant surprise. I thought I ordered a King Corner room, but it turned out to be a standard King room. I didn't bother objecting since we had limited time before our appointment and we had a pretty good view of Navy Pier. Otherwise everything was very nice. I'd recommend a return visit if it wasn't so expensive.",nan,1,ex2790
expedia,We stayed at the Swisshotel 2/13. We overlooked Navy Pier and the city; the view was great. The room was beautiful and spacious. We will stay there again.,nan,1,ex2791
expedia,Was not happy with this stay this time. Hotel was crazy busy parking was nightmare in front to get valet and I asked for room away from elevators and we were right near them. Did not final staff at front desk overly friendly more like pretentious. We have stayed at a lot of nice places including Fountainbleau in Miami and many great hotels in Chicago. I just didn't like the vibe this time.,nan,1,ex2792
expedia,"A nice Valentines getaway turned into a frigid experience because our room had NO HEAT the entire stay! The engineers had to be called 3 times and in the end, they said they couldn't move us because they had no other rooms available, but when we went on their website, we saw they had more suites available. When I asked about why we couldn't be moved to one of those, they replied it was because we booked through a 3rd party (hotels.com). I went down to the desk 3 times to complain, but the front desk had no response other than to disappear in the back and do nothing! So our room got down to 62 degrees and we bundled up and rode out the experience. Room service got our order wrong twice so our food took over 90 min to get. And I was promised a call back to our room from the front desk manager, twice, and they never called at all. I can't ever remember receiving such poor customer service from any hotel, regardless of star level. Very disappointing and it completely ruined our Valentines Day so I am going to book somewhere else to have us get a redo....",nan,1,ex2793
expedia,"Me and my husband stayed at this hotel 2/14/15 for a romantic getaway and it was prefect the room service was pricey but overall the room was clean , food was excellent, and hotel staff was amazing as well . We're going to be visiting again very soon.",nan,1,ex2794
expedia,The stay was great except housekeeping came in really early on Saturday (before 9am) They knocked once and just entered the room while I was having intercourse. Then she proceeded to ask me when would be a good time to come back. That was really uncomfortable and embarrassing for my girl.,nan,1,ex2795
expedia,"Beware: at breakfast, you will spend $7-$10 for a beverage. Not something with alcohol in it, simply juice from concentrate. Parking is another nightmare. The Valet will charge $67/night, whereas self-parking is $37/night. Little hidden scams are just built in everywhere. Everything is mediocre is very overpriced--we went once, and will never go back. I forwarded my concerns to management and got the whole: ""I understand, there's nothing we can do."" It's best to just stay at a place where the customer comes first and they are more transparent about their added costs. The gym, however, is actually amazing for a hotel.",nan,1,ex2796
expedia,"Room is clean. Very very nice window views. Staff is very polite. Not a huge deal but air conditioning in the premier room needs improvements though. There are 2 vents in the room and each has a thermostat. Those thermostats sync together. However, one vent was blowing out warm air while another one was blowing out cool air. Unfortunately the vent blowing out cool air was next to the bed. Thus we always felt cold even the thermostats were set to 80.",nan,1,ex2797
expedia,We stayed here one night while visiting my daughter who attends school downtown Chicago. We had friends who really like this hotel and decided to try it.,nan,1,ex2798
expedia,"The hotel is fancy and in a nice area. The room was dated, the outlets are buried and half of them do not work. The linens and towels are stiff and scratchy. There is mold in the bathroom. The hotel does everything for you: park your car, take care of your bags, meals. The staff is very happy to help (except for the bell captain) and charges a kings ransom for each service.",nan,1,ex2799
expedia,"I really want to give a perfect rating but to find the hotel was impossible! Luckily the staff was over the top nice. Room was amazing, view amazing. No complaints except the parking garage and finding the hotel. Really enjoyed this hotel.",nan,1,ex2800
expedia,"Had to change my reservation just before checking in. The hotel staff was very accommodating. The hotel itself reminds me of a new-age roman fusion. White-wash walls in the lobby area highlighted with different colored lights. While there, I made use of the restaurant attached.",nan,1,ex2801
expedia,Quiet relaxing stay. However you should not charge for wi-fi.,nan,1,ex2802
expedia,"Excellent hotel, modern furnishings, comfortable beds, spacious. I would love to stay here again in the future.",nan,1,ex2803
expedia,Great place with great facilities. The one gripe is that you have to pay for wifi in your room and even for a toothbrush and toothpaste if you forgot yours.,nan,1,ex2804

expedia,"This was our first time to Chicago- a weekend away from the kids with my husband. We decided to take a cab to the hotel from O-Hare and it was $40 plus tip. It was easy and worth it to get there quickly in about 20 minutes in no traffic at 8:30 PM on a Friday night. The train was only $5 per person, but the station is a bit of a walk from the hotel so we opted not to do that. We thought we might take the train on the way home, but it was snowing and quite cold, so we opted to do the cab again- same fare and quick drive. As far as the Swissotel, it has a nice lobby and check in was easy. I reserved and paid for the deluxe room with king (did not pay for lake view), but our room had a beautiful lake view with Navy Pier and the river on the 14th floor. It was a nice surprise and a fun view with the ferris wheel lit up at night and the lights on the dock, plus the skycraper lights, street lights, river walk lights, lit up trees, and vibe of the city. I want to thank the front desk for doing that! The room was very, very clean. It showed some wear on the walls, but honestly it was very nice. Nice carpet and bedding. The bathroom was also very clean. There is a Keurig and they give you 2 k-cups each day. The pool was not as nice as I expected. We did not use it. The view from the 42nd floor there was nice. Overall, I would recommend. You need to take a cab around the city...it's a long, cold walk in January. FYI- cab fares add up!",nan,1,ex2808
expedia,"Love it; everything about it was great. The location was perfect, and for that location - it's a bit of a premium, but well worth it.",nan,1,ex2809
expedia,"Upon check in, I sat in my car 5 minutes before being approached by valet. Valet was $65 dollars which is a bit pricey. At check-in, the front desk clerk was extremely rude and very unhelpful. He explained to me that I would be charged additionally for using the pool even though I was a guest for the night. I also inquired about a promo online to upgrade my room and even though the hotel had several rooms available, he insisted that I could not upgrade. The hotel room was a bit dusty and basic. The was little entertainment offered by the hotel compared to many othe hotels near by. I was definitely disappointed.",nan,1,ex2810
expedia,Premiere Corner King was Amazing! View was great! I definitely recommend this hotel!,nan,1,ex2811
expedia,"Came here for the Cubs Convention weekend and don't have any regrets about staying here rather than the Sheraton! It was a quick walk across the river. When we checked in, we were given a nice lakefront view without request. The room is impressive in size, as well as the bathroom. The staff is extremely friendly and attentive. They make you feel special. The elevator system is really cool and works well - you never have to wait for the elevator. All in all, probably one of the nicest hotels I have ever stayed at.",nan,1,ex2812
expedia,"The staff greeted us with a friendly smile, let us know where we could find everything in the hotel. When we called the front desk with questions, always were treated nicely. Room was clean, view was awesome!! Room service was good (a little pricey, but something we don't do often so it was a fun treat). When our son told the gentleman delivering the room service that it was his 4th birthday, he returned a short time later with two large cookies and a jar of M&M's asking if the birthday boy could have a treat. Check out was easy and the woman that checked us in the day before remembered our son's name which is nice. Very excellent staff and service- we will return and recommend this hotel.",nan,1,ex2813

expedia,Great hotel,nan,1,ex2815
expedia,"The hotel was in the perfect location for our needs on this trip. The rooms were spacious but the beds were small (would have really appreciated queens). Staff was friendly & attentive, especially Kurtis @ the front desk! Will stay again if planning to travel to this area again.",nan,1,ex2816
expedia,Second stay at the Swissotel. Great location. Great city/lake views. Courtesy and professional staff.,nan,1,ex2817
expedia,While the room was nice I find it a little pricy. For breakfast it would have been $56.00 plus tip. The bath towels were rough. the wi-fi was not free. The TV was had to work since you had to go back to the menu to change channels. The last morning the coffee maker did not work.,nan,1,ex2818
expedia,This hotel is well located and walking distance to many of the cities finest attractions. I would stay there again.,nan,1,ex2819
expedia,Nice hotel Lamp in desk did not work and the complimentary coffee in the room was all decaf.,nan,1,ex2820
expedia,"Stay was ok but the valet service was horrible. I paid $65 dollars to have my car valeted and when I got my car back the next day I was missing one of my center caps on my car. It was on my car when I arrived and gone when I left. I called and left the general manager a message on Friday 1/2/15, and I have not received a return call as of 1/6/15 from him. It is ridiculous that I spend that kind of money for a their service only to have one of their employees steal from me.",nan,1,ex2821
expedia,"We stayed in the city for new years with the kids so we were looking for something downtown, but not too busy with a decent pool. Be warned, since we weren't, that management likes to close the pool early on New Years, so our two teary eyed toddlers were denied swim before bedtime even though we showed up well before the posted 10PM close. Otherwise a clean quiet midrange hotel with some decent breakfast options within walking distance. Near the loop and mang mile, but far enough away from the hustle bustle and traffic. Nice views of the lake and city.",nan,1,ex2822
expedia,Definitely will stay here next time I sm I Chicago!,nan,1,ex2823
expedia,"After booking though Expedia the hotel desk agent said it would take an hour for our reservation to hit their system so we sat in the lobby for an hour waiting even though Expedia confirmed us to check in 15 minutes after booking. She told us she would call us over when she gets our reservation but she never did. When we went to check in,our reservations were effectively in the system,seemed like it was in the system immediately before the hour. She never called us over like she claimed. Once we got our room key,we were happy to check out the room and views. The room does not have a blow dryer,which doesn't work well for my wife and our son with long hair. The rooms seemed older as well. The views were beautiful but only if your standing or sitting directly in front of the window. You can't see the magnificent view from our bed. After we decided to stay another night (due to convenience of being settled in) and booked online. We kept getting disturbances from housekeeping who constantly came in the room unnotified several times until 9 pm,waking up our 3 year old. Overall,I've had better experiences at nearby hotels. Their pool and hot tub was great.",nan,1,ex2824
expedia,ok,nan,1,ex2825
expedia,"The Swissotel was a nice hotel, but I expected a little more. We stayed in a corner room on the 14th floor, and the views were mostly of the building next to us, with a few peeks at the river and such. Our room had no coffee maker and the price of water was outrageous. Plus, there is a $7 delivery fee for anything they bring to you. We requested a few plates and glasses, and yes, there was a $7 delivery fee! Nothing was complimentary, or at least we did not know of anything that may have been complimentary. The check-in staff was not very informative. Overall, it is a nice hotel, but for the price, there are much better options.",nan,1,ex2826
expedia,Overall we had a nice stay during the New Years Eve holidays. The hotel had a great location for viewing the fireworks over the lake and a short distance to the Millennium Park and Magnificent Mile shopping area.,nan,1,ex2827

expedia,I didn't like that I was told about the $100 incident charge and after I checked out the customer rep told me it takes a week to get it back on my credit card that is outrageous. Also maid pushed the bell and ran away. The Palm Restaurant was seriously overpriced and the food quality didn't justify the price. The waiter service was terrible.,nan,1,ex2830
expedia,Wonderful!!!,nan,1,ex2831
expedia,"Great hotel. Staff helpful and friendly. Room nice size, clean and quiet. Paid extra for room with river, lake and city views and was worth it! Wonderful workout room and pool. Great restaurants in and around hotel. This hotel has it all. Book it, you won't be disappointed!",nan,1,ex2832
expedia,Nice but for the price would have expected more.,nan,1,ex2833
expedia,Really disappointed. The hotel had a lot of potential but the room was not clean.,nan,1,ex2834

expedia,Very disorganized and overpriced meal experience for breakfast in the Hotel restaurant. Know that there is a Dunkin' Donuts in the basement of the building next-door connected underground.,nan,1,ex2840
expedia,"This isn't my first time at this hotel. Hotel is modern, clean, quiet, staff is very accommodating, standard room is spacious compared to similarly priced hotels and the indoor pool is great. There was only one problem, which is a big one...the room was so hot (December) we couldn't sleep. I was there with my kids, and it wasn't any fun to be staring at one another at 2 AM because we were too hot to sleep. Unfortunately for me, the negative outweighs the positive for me to stay there again. Especially when there are so many other choices in Chicago.",nan,1,ex2841
expedia,"Terrific experience, except I was very surprised and disappointed there was not complimentary coffee in the room or downstairs in the lobby. Kind of surprising for a 4 star hotel to lack this perk.",nan,1,ex2842
expedia,Toilet handle was broken . The vent in bathroom was filthy covered in dirt about a1/4 inch deep. The handle on the ice bucket broke.- We sent most of day at wedding and tv remote did not work properly. Will not stay here again.

expedia,"Very clean rooms, amenities such as robes and bottled water, comfortable bed with lots of pillows, and great service.",nan,1,ex2846
expedia,"Very nice location near the south end of the Magnificent Mile. We had a great view of Navy Pier. The Swissotel has the nicest workout area of any of the 15-20 hotels we've stayed at in Chicago. Friendly staff and nice, large (but not upscale) rooms. We got a great rate for two night near Christmas.",nan,1,ex2847
expedia,"I didn't realize that coffee and microwave were not included in the room. Also, the receptionist didn't relate what restaurants were in the hotel. She was very dry. Restaurant was very expensive. Could easily get more for my money elsewhere in the city. Bathroom had crackers on the floor. Not a family friendly hotel..",nan,1,ex2848
expedia,"Very pleased with the customer service, from the valet parking lot attendants to the service counter clerks. The hotel was clean and very beautiful. The view from our corner room was phenomenal. We were able to see the city and Lake Michigan. The view of Navy Pier at night was breathtakingly beautiful. The restaurant downstairs had a great menu to choose from and was tasty.",nan,1,ex2849

The staff was extremely friendly and helpful and the hotel is beautiful! Very clean and spacious rooms.,nan,1,ex2851
expedia,Great hotel - only complaint is that rooms do not have a micro and none are available to the public anywhere in the hotel. Management refused to assist in heating up food for my 2 year old grandchild. We were told there was no micros due to health concerns. We believe it is because the hotel views this as a way to force room service.,nan,1,ex2852
expedia,Gorgeous hotel that is in a great part of Chicago. Close enough to so many restaurants and attractions. I would definitely recommend it.,nan,1,ex2853

I got a Corner King Room on expedia. When I got there, the concierge noticed it was my birthday, which is nice. He claimed a Corner King on the 4th floor was the only one left. I can't recall exactly my response but I made it clear that was disappointing for me. After two minutes of him clicking around on the computer, he said he found a corner king suite, and he would give it to me. I was very happy to get the upgrade. The room was better than I expected it would be, 3304. The best thing is the view. It looked over Lake Michigan, Navy Pier, the river, and some downtown area, including the Trump Tower. There ""may"" be better views out there, but this was awesome and breath taking, and was 100% satisfied with the view. It was actually a foggy day and I still was impressed. The room had two bathrooms, a living area with a tv, a separate bedroom with a tv and with window, and another bathroom with a separate tub and shower. The bed was great, very comfortable. The room would impress anyone I know. It has all the bells and whistles one could expect for a hotel to have. It's not clear to me if they charge for internet or not or pool access, but they didn't charge me.",nan,1,ex2859
expedia,"Each year for our anniversary we spend a few days in the city to get away, celebrate and do a little shopping. Our stay with you was wonderful! Our room had a spectacular view, and the bed was heavenly. My only complaint: no coffee machine in the room.",nan,1,ex2860
expedia,We loved the room and fitness area. The pool and hot tub were great except that there was some type of accident on the last day and both were drained so we didn't get the chance to go in either on our last day.,nan,1,ex2861
expedia,"A first-rate and very comfortable hotel, friendly and helpful staff, just the right scale, a good range of quality services without being overwhelming, very well-located. Fantastic beds and we enjoyed the room lighting. Coming back every night felt like coming home. Located on the River, a couple of blocks from the Magnificent Mile and walking distance, even in bad weather, to good restaurants, shops and attractions. Our room overlooked the River, the Navy Pier and the Lake, so we had a sense of openness and nature -- sun and light and air. We felt close to everything but not trapped in a big city. Maid, doorman, concierge and restaurant staff all went out of their way to help us.",nan,1,ex2862
expedia,The only negative I can think of is we experienced problems with the tv,nan,1,ex2863

expedia,I have stayed at this hotel before and it was excellent as usual. Comfortable rooms with great views and a great location. Easy to walk to Michigan Ave shopping and attractions. Easy to drive or take cab anywhere else you might want to go. I will definitely stay here again. Thanks,nan,1,ex2866
expedia,Just a note that parking is a little steep at $65 a night.,nan,1,ex2867
expedia,Can't beat the centralized location to not only the Mag Mile but State Street and Millenium Park as well. Pay the small up charge for a lake view - you will not be disappointed! Rooms are large but missing a coffee machine - don't know what you've got until it's gone! Small complaint however on an excellent hotel!,nan,1,ex2868
expedia,"The hotel is centrally located close to the new Maggie Daley Park, and within walking distance to many other attractions",nan,1,ex2869
expedia,The room was excellant. The bed very comfortable. I liked that the bathroom had both a tub and a separate shower. We ate at two of the restaurants and they both were delicious.,nan,1,ex2870
expedia,"Checked in late at night for our anniversaryand the lady who assigned the room couldn't have been nicer. Went to Amuse for a drink and the barkeep was a jerk. Up in the room, the toilet was filling every minute or so. Called down to switch rooms before we unpacked and all they could do was send a man up. He worked on it a while and said that was all he could do. At 2am it started running again. I called the desk to say I was going to turn off the water supply to get some sleep but expected something done in the a.m. Ruby said she would leave a note for the morning staff. After a great breakfast in the Geneva restaurant with truly professional staff we asked and the concierge seemed more concerned with what she couldn't do than with fixing it. I asked for the manager and was told he was busy. When Jeff got free he offered to switch our room. His smile was plastic and his tone patronizing, but full marks for being the one person there who stopped making excuses and fixed it. He offered us free drinks in Amuse, I hope not as a further insult but rather because he doesn't know how bad his night barkeeper's attitude is. The new room had plumbing with a slow trickle instead of the on/off filling. We closed the door and that quieted it enough to sleep. 2 rooms, 2 leaks--I wonder how much water is being wasted through poor maintenance. Lee shoved a note under the door that apologized for the issues and wished me a ""happy birthday."" Did not meet expectations.",nan,1,ex2871
expedia,"This was one of the most amazing hotels I have ever stayed at. Incredible views, close to everything, and the room and staff were so great. I will stay here again and absolutely recommend to my friends and family!!",nan,1,ex2872
expedia,Swissotel has recently undergone changes. The coffee service in the room is not available. Bad idea!,nan,1,ex2873
expedia,"This is my second stay in this hotel and definitely not my last. In Chicago, it's hard to tell whether you're paying for quality or location. But with Swissotel, you get both for a fair price. The beds are comfortable, the decor is updated, the water pressure in the shower is great. Unfortunately in my most recent room, the cabinet door was off one of the hinges and the handle on the shower door was a little loose. Other than those minor flaws, my stay was next to perfect.",nan,1,ex2874
expedia,Surprised to find that the beds in our room for 3 were full instead of queen. It all worked out and we had a great time,nan,1,ex2875

expedia,Great corner room with great view. Nice amenities and convenient to conference.,nan,1,ex2878
expedia,"All in all, a good hotel. But I have two complaints: 1. I called prior to booking and was told they had coffee in the room. 2. There is no station guide on the television and it has very limited channels.",nan,1,ex2879
expedia,The front desk staff lacked a certain level of professionalism that I've received during previous stays.,nan,1,ex2880
expedia,"We booked 3 rooms for our family, so quite expensive, but your prices were reasonable... thanks! They said check in was at 3, but when I arrived after 3, some rooms weren't ready. The clerk worked hard to find 3 rooms we could move into on the same floor and upgraded us to lake view. We appreciated that. Two rooms were ready and the third one needed cleaning still. We moved into the two rooms and she quickly brought us the key for the third room. I regret to say that after all that work.... the third room needed the sheets changed and the bathroom cleaned still AFTER we moved in. I asked the desk to please clean the room while we were out that evening. They did clean it. Other than the initial delays, they accommodated us well.",nan,1,ex2881
expedia,"I usually always enjoy my stay at this hotel, it's beautiful, there's great dining and I live the spa. This particular time was no different from that, just unusual. There was a water bottle top under the desk and the flash handle on the toilet was broken, really had to jiggle and play with it to work. It was minor so I didn't complain but I was disappointed to see this from this type of high end hotel.",nan,1,ex2882
expedia,"Overall very nice hotel...but the feather bed was so awful, I actually had scratches from the protruding feathers on my hands, feet, and ankles! :-(",nan,1,ex2883

expedia,Great Stay!!,nan,1,ex2885
expedia,"Girls weekend was great! Beds were so comfy, room was clean, bathroom was clean and spacious. Would stay again. They do put a $100 hold on your credit card for incidentals and may forget to tell you that.",nan,1,ex2886
expedia,"Very nice hotel and its been kept up. Nice sized bathroom and plenty of space overall. But I learned a lesson on cost here. I expect when I pay $250 for a room that parking shouldn't be over 60, and at least a continental breakfast should be complimentary. Unfortunately we had some very loud folks in the room next to us and even after warned they got even louder. It took a couple of hours for hotel customer service to get the party stopped in the room next door. I wouldn't say that it ruined my stay but I can attest to some very thin walls between the rooms and even though the hotel knew of the noise issue they didn't offer to comp us anything. To top it off the next morning we called down for our car to be brought around and they told us it would be 20 minutes. It was over 1 hour. That's unacceptable in any case and even worse with a baby. The hotel is quick to charge you to use the internet or park your car but when they don't follow through on their end it is disappointing. Instead of staying in a 100$ hotel a half hour away I wanted to give my family a great experience. Instead, sadly, we left frustrated and disappointed.",nan,1,ex2887
expedia,"Given the occasion I wanted something special and grown up. The room was certainly nice, but not luxurious or special.",nan,1,ex2888
expedia,Parking way to high hotel next door cheaper so that's very inconvenient!!!,nan,1,ex2889
expedia,Great hotel minimal waits on elevators and minimal traffic,nan,1,ex2890
expedia,Great hotel upgrade room nice view Recommend highly,nan,1,ex2891

expedia,"We have stayed at the Swissotel many times over the past decade. The hotel is clean and efficient with excellent service. The rooms are very comfortable with premium bedding and comfortable beds. Views are very good, even after the neighborhood has grown up around it. Our favorite hotel in Chicago despite several stays at more expensive facilities.",nan,1,ex2893

expedia,"Wonderful time , great staff, great bar , beautiful views,and location is awesome.",nan,1,ex2895
expedia,"Location was perfect, the view from our 4th floor room was fantastic. Hotel staff was friendly, attentive, and helpful. The concierge set up dining, entertainment, and suggested the perfect places for us to enjoy the night life as three single women. So many great locations and activities within walking distance, taxi service for the others. We always felt safe. The pedway connected to the hotel was perfect for accessing other hotels and businesses without stepping out into the super cold weather. My only wish would have been a microwave and coffee pot in the room. We could have enjoyed leftovers from the fantastic but large meals, and hot tea without going down to the bar. I would recommend the Swissotel to anyone and would stay there again.",nan,1,ex2896
expedia,"Hotel is excellent overall, but the room service bill left a sour taste for me. I travel frequently and order room service all the time, so I know what is reasonable and what is outrageus. For dinner, I ordered a burger and pot of coffee. I was charged $40.24 on check out. They said there's a $5 delivery charge, plus 20% gratuity, plus tax. Excessive. And the delivery and gratuity were not on the bill that I signed for when the food was delivered to my room. And if I had known about the automatic gratuity, I would not have tipped the waiter $5. Same thing for breakfast next morning (eggs benedict + pot of coffee = $41.54). Very sneaky. Beware.",nan,1,ex2897
expedia,Dated. Needs upgrade. Good service.,nan,1,ex2898
expedia,"I stayed here by default as my favorite and frequent choices did not have availability. I have two fundamental issues with this hotel. Recognizing staying in downtown Chicago is an expensive proposition to begin with for the price paid would it really be all that difficult to provide free Wi-Fi and coffee in the rooms. I personally consider both of these base services in todays environment and to have to pay extra for Wi-Fi and room service to get a cup of coffee is simply being too cheap and trying to max how much of my wallet I leave behind. Specific to my room the heating/cooling system was quite a constant noise which bordered beyond ""white"" noise for the room although it meant you heard nothing else.",nan,1,ex2899
expedia,"When we were checking in our host ZEE aksed if we were there for a special occasion. When I informed her that we were celebrating my wife's birthday she checked availability and upgraded us to a suite with a view of Navy Pier and Lake Michigan. It was beautiful.

expedia,"I've only ever stayed in a Corner King so I can't comment to the other rooms, and I love them. The bathroom in any hotel room shouldn't be close to where you sleep (unless you're handicapped) along with the size, that's what I like most. Nice clean comfortable bed, tv with a guide, and a spacious bathroom with all the extras you may need.",nan,1,ex2904
expedia,Expected more comfortable bed. Arm chair wasn't clean. Shower slab could have been cleaner,nan,1,ex2905

expedia,"Staff was pleasant but I was told to pay for Wi Fi and they would then deduct it from my hotel bill. They didn't . If I hadn't caught it I would have been charged. Hotel bar is too expensive , Service is poor, and they close too early",nan,1,ex2907
expedia,Beautiful room with spectacular view of the lake and river. Very clean and comfortable. Would definitely stay again.,nan,1,ex2908
expedia,"They gave us a free room upgrade without even asking. Great Lake,Navy Pier and downtown view from our corner room.",nan,1,ex2909

Update the beds to memory foam or something, for $300 a night I sort of was left wanting more in terms of comfort. Also the room was roasting hot, even with the thermostat turned down to 65 it was very hot.",nan,1,ex2910

expedia,Staff were very helpful. Let us check in at 9:00 AM. Good recommendations for restaurants and concierge made reservations without hesitation. Will go back there.,nan,1,ex2919
expedia,The hotel was great. First time in Chicago so the location was convenient and the view of the river was excellent. Valet was a bit pricey @ 65/night but parking in Chicago was expensive everywhere. Bathroom was nice but the fan never cut off for some reason.

expedia,"I had a very nice stay at this hotel. However, there were two things that bothered my friend and I: 1) There was no coffee maker in the room. My friend and I figured that the Starbucks in the lobby would make less money if there WAS a coffee maker in the room. My friend likes herbal tea and even brought her own bags to enjoy early in the morning. She got charged $6.00 for a cup of herbal tea at the Starbucks. That's ridiculous. 2) WiFi is an extra charge unless you join Swissotel's ""club"". This hotel, from what I can tell, is mostly business and I think that's price gouging to charge for WiFi. Other than those two things, I had an enjoyable stay with an amazing view of Chicago!",nan,1,ex2923

expedia,Outrageous parking fees & hours wait at registration for very high overall room rate when parking at nearly every restaurant is $14 for entire evening and even overnight as another guest experienced. Many other alternatives makes this a last consideration vs first next time!,nan,1,ex2929
expedia,"Having stayed at the Swissotel and a number of other hotels in the vicinity including Palomar, Fairmont Ritz carlton only this hotel will demand a drivers license (despite a credit card with a picture) which they then record in the system. Much to ones consternation because none of these companies (whether that be target or Home Depot or J.P. Morgan or Swissotel) be trusted with securing our personal information. Furnishings are from the last decade and in need of a makeover.",nan,1,ex2930
expedia,"We had a great experience at the Swissotel! The hotel was a little hard to find because of Upper v. Lower Wacker, but once we stopped paying attention to the GPS and just used street signs we found it. Great walking distance to The Mile and Soldier Field, resturants, parks, etc. The room was spacious and clean, very nice clean bathroom. We had room service for breakfast and the food was good too. Overall a very positive experience. We would stay for a weekend again!",nan,1,ex2931
expedia,"Nice hotel and great location downtown. Upper floors are quiet and room was spacious. Only improvements I would recommend is new beds - mine seemed older and there was a thin cotton ""blanket"" on top of the mattress, rather than a pad. Since they don't use fitted sheets we had to fix the bedding at night and in the morning. Loved that they had the option to skip housekeeping for a $5.00 daily credit at the restaurants/bar, but would rather have it be a room credit in general. Internet in the room is overpriced.",nan,1,ex2932

Our concierge that checked us in could have been more friendly, but all the others helping guest seemed to be more than welcoming. The spa was nice, but over priced for the service provided. It was a bit choppy and mechanical instead of relaxing.",nan,1,ex2934
expedia,This was our second time staying at the Swissotel because we had such a great experience the first time. The staff is always great and the beds are the most comfortable hotel beds I have ever slept on. This time we were put in a beautiful corner unit with views of both the lake and river.,nan,1,ex2935
expedia,"Overall, I absolutely love it and will be back but not with as many people. I had called ahead to ask if I could get a cot to accommodate the 4 people in the room with double beds. I was told yes. But when I arrived and found no extra 1 cot and called to request one, I was told that was not possible because it was fire hazard to have a cot in the room. i asked for extra linen so the one person could sleep on the floor and after a long 45 minute wait, they brought up a few items. We winded up taking the comforter from one bed to place on the floor to make it somewhat comfortable.",nan,1,ex2936
expedia,"Great beds, great staff, very clean, beautiful view. The valet service was not helpful and it made for a stressful time finding parking. The room was so great.

expedia,"I was passing through Chicago on a trip with my boyfriend. The hotel was great. Centrally located in the loop right btwn Millennium Park and the Mag Mile shopping area. The views of the river and lake are exceptional. The staff was very efficient and friendly. My only complaint is they charge extra for in-room internet and for access to the fitness center. At the prices they charge it should be included. The hotel is nice, but not that nice.",nan,1,ex2939
expedia,"Have stayed here before, enjoyed it again!",nan,1,ex2940
expedia,"When we arrived, we were greeted by nobody! I had to walk over the valet stand and ask them to valet my car even though I was parked right in front of them. Not that big of a deal but if you want my business then at least try a little since valet cost $65. Once I entered the hotel and got to the counter the women who helped me was very nice. Here was her mistake. I had told the hotel when I booked the room that it was my anniversary and I wanted a room with a king bed. That is all I asked for. So, when I checked in, the woman asked if I wanted to upgrade for $80, I said no thank you. As soon as I said no, she said well I already upgraded you for your anniversary. Whoa, so you upgraded me but then you were going to try and make me pay for it. What happened to doing the little things for the customer so that they returned to your hotel. I left irritated but grabbed my bags and my wife and I went up to the room on the 10th floor where we stayed. The door was all scratched up and so heavy my wife couldn't push through it. The carpet in the room was pulling up in the middle and the comforter was stained slightly. There were smudges on the remote and the bathroom floor hadn't been vacuumed. The shower door also leaks if water hits the crack which causes water to be all over the floor when you get out which my wife slipped in. Overall, I felt like this hotel had some nice features like restaurants and its right on Wacker so location is good, but I was not satisfied.",nan,1,ex2941
expedia,"Fabulous expriencewith this beautiful Hotel. Unfortunately, we didnt have the lake's view but the location and comfort is fantastic. The cost was reasonable, as well.",nan,1,ex2942

I have two small issues, the hot water wasn't very hot and the pipes were noisy when the hot water was on. I was also dissapointed that there were no in room coffee makers, for the daily rate of the room I shouldn't have to pay another $3-$5 and go to the lobby for some coffee. Beyond these two issue I would stay at the property again no question.",nan,1,ex2948
expedia,"We requested the harbor view corner king room and were told it would be ready for us when we arrived for our checkin at 3 pm but when we arrived it was not ready. They had another room available but not the one we requested. If it was not possible to have it ready by the time we arrived, I would have appreciated just being told that over the phone instead of arriving and then having to wait 2 hours for that room to become available. The front desk told us 45 minutes but it took much longer. We were only staying one night as well so I felt it was a waste of my time and money to have to wait for the room. If i was just told it wouldnt be ready, I would have just taken a different room. Other than that, our stay was great.

expedia,"A lovely hotel with comfortable well designed rooms and great views of the city. Elevators are fast and love the Starbucks in the lobby. My only problem: I was attending a conference at the Sheraton right across the river. To get there with a suitcase from the Swissotel, you must take a metal staircase down about 4 flights to get to the Columbus bridge. Surely, there's a way to take an elevator to Lower Wacker, through parking lot perhaps, to get across the river more easily. The check-in desk was not well organized, hard to know which clerks were open and I waited a while only to have others who had come up after me get service first. A simple rope line would help there.

Passed the expensive valet parking (still about average) and used a self-park garage which was very secure and was directly connected to the hotel. We chose this hotel so that our kids could watch the Navy Pier fireworks just outside hotel. Instead of walking to the NP, we took a 2 minute walk to the East end of upper Wacker drive. Fantastic spot to watch the fireworks. If you want to watch the fireworks from the room, the corner king room is the only possibility. From our room next to the corner king, 2/3 would have be behind other buildings. If you want to watch it from a room, I recommend W Lakeshore. We'd stay Swissotel again.",nan,1,ex2969
expedia,"Room in tip-top condition...looks like it may have been recently remodeled. Get a room with a view and you'll see Navy Pier, the lake, Chicago river with the many tour barges and some snazzy new hi-rise apartments all around you. Fitness center was free (not $15 as mentioned by some other commenters) and room had a small drink fridge also free---guess they gave up on the mini-bar idea which is just as well, since CVS and other retailers are close by for drinks and snacks). All in all, a pleasant stay.",nan,1,ex2970
expedia,Every time we spoke to someone on the staff they were very helpful and nice.,nan,1,ex2971
expedia,"The pros: amazing views, great location, spacious rooms and well designed bathrooms. The cons: extremely uncomfortable beds and no coffee maker in room although it is listed as an amenity included in the room. There is an additional cost if you want one during your stay which is not listed in the reservation information.",nan,1,ex2972

expedia,"Hotel excelentemente ubicado, cerca de todo. El hotel es caro para el servicio que brinda y el estado del hotel en general no es de lo mejor. El personal es atento, lo necesario. Las fotos que muestran en internet difieren bastante con lo que me encontre cuando llegue al hotel. La habitacion que me dieron se nota que tiene bastante uso, la alfombra tenia muchas manchas, el empapelado de las paredes manchado y en algunas partes se estaba despegando. Lo bueno de la habitacion las camas, muy comodas.",nan,1,ex2975
expedia,My daughter and I spent three restful nights and enjoyed three scrumptious breakfast buffets. The fitness center was solid too.,nan,1,ex2976

The view was wonderful! I had no idea which location or hotel to stay at, now that I am a little more familiar with the city, I would definitely choose this one again! Thank you!",nan,1,ex2978

expedia,Very clean hotel near Navy Pier with excellent views. Walking distance to lots of things. We would stay here again.,nan,1,ex2981

expedia,"I was looking for a four star hotel on various travel web sites for my weekend visit to Chicago. Among the many options I found an ""unpublished"" rate for a undisclosed 4 star hotel in Chicago. The rate was much reduced and I thought I'd book it and see how it would go. It ended up being a great experience. Friendly front desk young woman checked me in and gave me a room on 30th floor with a nice view of the Chicago River. Very clean and well appointed room with a super bathroom. All pros and no cons for Swissotel Chicago. Highly recommend to others looking for a fab hotel at a great location!",nan,1,ex2987
expedia,Effortless check in and check out. Provided info about the city and always made sure transportation was available.,nan,1,ex2988

expedia,Loved this hotel. We had a great room! Staff was very nice and helpful!,nan,1,ex2993
expedia,Very good hotel- offers a complimentary wine hour every day which is really cool. The rooms are decorated really fun and have pretty good views. The beds are comfortable.,nan,1,ex2994
expedia,I stayed at the hotel for five nights. I was very impressed.,nan,1,ex2995

expedia,"Everything at this hotel was wonderful - the room, the staff, the location. We'd forgotten a razor, a toothbrush, and a phone charger and were provided with all, free of charge (the charger was a lender). Our toilet was leaking just a tad and when reported they had someone up to fix it in minutes! I'd go back any time. :)",nan,1,ex2997
expedia,Will definitely stay here on next trip to Chicago,nan,1,ex2998
expedia,"great location and very confortable,my family love it.",nan,1,ex2999
expedia,"The staff were friendly and helpful. Unfortunately the room seemed as if they rushed through the cleaning with dirty glasses in the bathroom, hair on the pillowcases and an obviously very quickly made bed. Also a heads up that paying for overnight parking only gets you until 2pm the next day no matter how late the previous day you parked. Would recommend you self park in one of the nearby ramps and get a 24hr pass. It also must be said that the comfort of a hotel bed is always something to look forward to but this bed left me wishing id spent money elsewhere. Oh yes wifi is not included in your room fee even though it says it does!!!",nan,1,ex3000
expedia,"We had such a lovely stay here. The staff were friendly, welcoming and helpful. Sheila and Richard were extremely helpful in helping me to arrange a birthday surprise for my husband even before we arrived in the hotel. The room was spacious, clean and comfortable, offering a range of services and little additional touches. This was the best hotel stay I've had in a long time.",nan,1,ex3001
expedia,"This was my first time staying at this property. I was pleasantly surprised. What great place. The room was very large, bes so comfortable and the window seats were just the coolest thing! The bathroom was enormous, and the water pressure was great. The staff was very helpful and friendly. We enjoyed the bar and restaurant. Food was excellent. I will be staying here again.",nan,1,ex3002
expedia,We stayed in a king room with river views. It was amazing! We looked out of our window to see the river and the Trump tower. Our room was a good size and the staff were so helpful. We didn't want to leave!,nan,1,ex3003
expedia,"Hotel was lovely and right in the middle of a lot of great stuff, however, I was not prepared for the ridiculous overnight parking fee for my two-night stay. I expected a charge, and even asked upon arrival how the parking worked, but staff alluded my questions and made it sound like the hotel would ""take care of it"" when I turned in my ticket. I was very upset that it cost $116 and wasn't warned on the website or by staff so I could have chosen to stay elsewhere or park elsewhere more affordable. Do not assume that people expect that type of charge. I was willing to overlook the price of the room each night and taxes with very few amenities for how lovely it was, but add the parking and I felt OVER charged.",nan,1,ex3004
expedia,"Staff was helpful and friendly. Beds were very comfortable, decor was awesome and the room had a great view of the river. Would definitely come back!",nan,1,ex3005
expedia,We stayed at this hotel to go to a concert at the Chicago theater. We were able to park in a parking garage about a block away. The Chicago theater was just over a block away which made it easy to walk to. There were good restaurant options close by as well. The hotel and room were very clean and the staff was friendly.,nan,1,ex3006
expedia,"Very large room. Excellent bed. All staff members were friendly, professional, and polite.",nan,1,ex3007
expedia,"Close to Chicago's most important attractions like the millennium park, museum of art, and Michigan Ave. Complimentary wine hour everyday, and compliantaty coffee and tea every morning. Elegant decor, and friendly staff. Would definitely recommend it and stay in it again.",nan,1,ex3008
expedia,"We stayed here on a Sunday. Service was great & staff was helpful. A lovely perk is that they had a hot chocolate bar in the afternoon as well as wine in the evening. Since it was snowy & cold, that was a perfect addition to our stay. The room was large & quiet. I would absolutely return!",nan,1,ex3009
expedia,"Great location, friendly staff. Love the 5pm wine hour in lobby.",nan,1,ex3010
expedia,"I loved Kimpton hotels and this one was no different. The service was excellent and the room was incredibly comfortable. The window love seats are a really cool touch and I enjoyed sitting there. Would stay here again, especially for the price.",nan,1,ex3011
expedia,Had a wonderful stay! The hotel staff was very friendly and helpful. Some guests were partying in the room next to us and the front desk staff was very accommodating of our request to be relocated. Will definitely stay again. The windo seats are awesome!!!,nan,1,ex3012
expedia,This was just a one-night business trip and the main office is on Lake Street - so all worked perfectly. Thanks - and I look forward to staying with you again.,nan,1,ex3013
expedia,"We enjoyed our stay. We were celebrating our anniversary and they sent complimentary sparkling wine, strawberries and bath salts to our room. We were upgraded to a view room. Very nice touch. Staff very helpful and friendly.",nan,1,ex3014
expedia,Left an important item in room and realized this only when I was at the airport. Called and for immediate response and assistance. Loved the ambience and service . Centrally located,nan,1,ex3015
expedia,"First time staying at a Kimpton hotel and it will not be my last! This hotel was extremely affordable and conveniently located right in the middle of most of the places we wanted to visit. We were very impressed with the room, with the sole exception being the bathroom as it seemed a bit run down compared to the rest of the room. We made the free wine social each night from 5-6 a priority. FREE WINE! It was quite tasty, and hot toddies were also offered (and also free). If we had a child with us, not sure we would have chosen the hotel since there was no breakfast. However, as a couple this place was fantastic and we will be staying here again.",nan,1,ex3016
expedia,"Hotel was very nice, room was very organized thank you,The only thing that I had a little issue with was at night the trucks in the back you could actually hear them",nan,1,ex3017
expedia,Excellent in every respect. The room maid left an animal made from a towel on our bed every day.,nan,1,ex3018
expedia,"Good value for room, as long as not facing west toward the very noisy loop trains. Attached restaurant - stay away.",nan,1,ex3019
expedia,"Nice location, large room, comfortable bed, great overall.",nan,1,ex3020
expedia,"This was a beautiful hotel with respectful, friendly and helpful staff. The bed was very comfortable and the room beautiful and clean. I especially enjoyed the window seat with view of the river and city. The location was good. Just out of winter walking distance to the Grant Park area, but an easy cab ride. I found the valet parking to be well worth the $58/day price. I just left the car and walked or took a cab to where I needed to go for stress free touring. Museum campus and Grant Park are not far. Lots of great restaurants close enough for walking or a short cab ride.",nan,1,ex3021
expedia,"Our stay was great. I travel frequently around the world for business, and chose Hotel Monaco for personal travel due to the small ""boutique feel"" of the hotel. The stay there always seems personalized and comfortable. The front desk staff and bellmen were very gracious and helpful.",nan,1,ex3022
expedia,"Stayed one night for business. I love Kimptons so always look forward to them. This one is nice, but nothing particularly special for the brand. Very friendly and helpful staff, but the room was just good (sorry, Kimpton, you get graded on a curve).",nan,1,ex3023
expedia,"We enjoyed our stay here very much. The only downside was the heater seemed to not work very well and the room was a bit cold. Other than that, no complaints.",nan,1,ex3024
expedia,"Spacious room (King City View) with space for 2 + 50lb dog. Great pet amenities: food/water bowl, pet bed, treat welcome package, listing of groomers, sitters, and local dog friendly attractions. Friendly staff.",nan,1,ex3025
expedia,"The room was as described, except the promised view wasn't. hile I was thinking about this in my first minutes in the room, the front desk called to see if everything was to my liking. I mentioned my impression and they immediately offered to move me to a higher floor with a better view. That was much better. However, the mid-rise across the street is undergoing a huge renovation and they start using their very loud construction elevators at about 6am. Comfy bed though! The windows had cozy window seats and big pillows which were great for curling and taking in the improved view and the skyline. The hotel restaurant was limited. The lobby is really lovely and the wine hour was a really nice touch. Big glamorous armchairs by a fire and fun people watching? Sign me up. The gym is fairly well appointed, but there are no kettlebells and the free weights only go up to 50. There are med balls, but I think they only go up to about 15. There are ample towels and bottles of water and sanitizing wipes are available for wiping down equipment. The bathroom was spacious and properly appointed, but I wouldn't call it luxurious. It was however scrupulously clean. There is an umbrella in the room for your use, which was a nice touch. The housekeeping staff does a great job in keeping everything perfectly clean.",nan,1,ex3026
expedia,"We were always welcomed very warmly at the Hotel Monaco, and the bed was extremely comfortable. It was generally a fine stay. It's not at all a flashy place, and it could easily be a very old building that's been updated (hard to tell one way or the other). The only downside was that our room overlooked an ugly alleyway; it was a very slow weekend in Chicago and they could have probably put us on the other side overlooking the river, but we didn't ask and they didn't offer. Perhaps those rooms were a higher rate class, or being held for their frequent visitors.",nan,1,ex3027
expedia,Very comfortable and lovely ambuance. Will definitely return. Great location and loved the window seats!!,nan,1,ex3028
expedia,"This was our first trip to Chicago. Walked to the hotel from the metro station (easiest way into the city without a car) and it was easy enough to find. Even late at night everyone was pleasant. The hotel did not ruin our trip, but for what we paid I was expecting more The pros -bed is lovely and comfortable -roomy closet -room was large and comfy -carpet felt clean on bare feet -thermostat was easy to adjust and reacted quickly -staff was pleasant and accomodating. -Location was fantastic The cons - it was freezing outside and they stopped providing hot water for tea and coffee after 10 am- its ridiculous. I have been to a holiday inn in the south where you can always get a cup of hot tea. -No way to make hot water in the room -the bathrobes are lovely but would only fit a model. I am a size 10 and 5'11"" and couldn't fit into one. -I called down for extra towels and they never came-see next item -If you take a shower, it will flood the bathroom. Even after making sure the curtain was pulled tight to keep water from going out- we wasted 2 large towels trying to keep the floor dry so we wouldn't go slip and sliding. -moulding on the floor in the bathroom is cracked and needs to be replaced. For how much we paid I expected better. -Few out of our window was of an adjoining roof and ac unit -Our room was right next to the AHVAC system room- constant drum of noise 24/7 The room we were in really should not exist",nan,1,ex3029
expedia,We received a bill the next morning from the front desk for a lesser price than our stay was through hotels.com... We basically got overcharged. Parking was also not included in the initial charge from hotels.com... Very irritating to find out we got over charged for our room along with them needing to also pay th hotel an additional $58 for parking... Irritating,nan,1,ex3030
expedia,"The hotel is okay but is not a four star. $58 for valet parking, very mediocre but expensive restaurant, and they stop coffee at 10am so you pay $6 for a cup anytime after. The rooms are nice but not plush.",nan,1,ex3031
expedia,Best staff at the hotel. Always offering to help and giving advice. Hot chocolate time was a plus!,nan,1,ex3032
expedia,Great staycation,nan,1,ex3033
expedia,Fab!,nan,1,ex3034
expedia,"This was my first time staying at Hotel Monaco, but I'll definitely be staying there again. A large room for downtown Chicago and it was very clean. The location was perfect if you are looking for a place around State St. Only a block from the state/lake ""L"" stop. The staff was awesome and very friendly. The coffee, hot cocoa, and wine hour was a great plus after coming in from the cold.",nan,1,ex3035
expedia,"We have stayed at the Monaco numerous times. Cozy boutique hotel, great price, great location. We discovered it with our dog, it is a dog friendly hotel, yet you wouldn't know it except for the cute pups walking around. I know there are many great hotels in Chicago, but we feel most at home at the Monaco. Highly recommend it and they often have GREAT price deals.",nan,1,ex3036
expedia,"Great location - very consistent brand (I prefer Kimpton hotels). Only downside is that this hotel is a bit ""worn"" in places, mainly the bathroom. The tub is old and baseboards / tile was very worn. Other than that, it was yet another fantastic stay at a Kimpton hotel. I will absolutely continue to stay at Kimpton hotels in the future.",nan,1,ex3037

expedia,My family loved this hotel. The windows in the rooms where amazing I couldn't get the kids out of them or husband;) The beds were very comfortable and the bathroom was huge.

expedia,"Last minute decision to stay in Chicago so grabbed a hotel room here and had nothing but the clothes on my back great to have everything I would need right there for me to use in the room toothbrushes,razor ect ect that is great and I hope to see this in more hotels in the future. Keep up the great work.",nan,1,ex3045
expedia,"Good points: Location is great, close to State St and Michigan Ave. Bed confortable. Bad points: room is small. Bathroom is dated and extremely small - no counter space for toiletries. No view. Could hear street noise all night and noise from hallways. Bar in hotel was awful. The drinks were awful.",nan,1,ex3046
expedia,I love the wine tasting also and The free coffe to go is also very good,nan,1,ex3047

Staff was very gracious. Rooms haven't been updated in quite some time, but still not ugly. We arrived incredibly early (930 am) and were given a room when we got there, almost unheard of (even if they have them~ they often won't let you in).",nan,1,ex3049

expedia,We loved every moment from the doorman to relaxing in the window seats with our wine. Highly recommend this trendy boutique hotel that hosts a happy wine hour from 5 to 6 daily. Great location with a 3 block walk from the blue line loop from Ohare airport. Enjoy your stay. We will be back.,nan,1,ex3052
expedia,The entire stay at this hotel was wonderful. It was clean and everyone that worked there was very friendly and able to help whenever they could. I would definately stay there again on our next travel to Chicago. Would recommend to anyway!!,nan,1,ex3053

expedia,You have to love the Kimptom hotels! I was first drawn in by the offer to have a goldfish in your room when we visited Seattle years ago. I love the contemporary decor and colors! The afternoon wine reception is always a plus. We had just a basic king room here without a view. That is the only drawback I can point out. I suspect we could have paid more for a room with a view.,nan,1,ex3061
expedia,Everything was excellent! Best hotel we have ever stayed.,nan,1,ex3062
expedia,Great stay. Thanks. Comfortable. Clean. Great location.,nan,1,ex3063
expedia,Clean and updated. Modern with an Art Nouveau feel. There was a wine reception each night in the lobby which my husband and I enjoyed to kick start our night out on the town. Within walking distance to lots of shopping and great restaurants. Staff was very curtious and friendly. We would definitely stay here again.,nan,1,ex3064
expedia,"We were looked after very well during our stay. The doorman (Antony, I believe) was especially helpful and welcoming, as was the concierge. She not only set us up with dinner reservations and a great blues club but also helped us with some color printing issues. You can't beat the complementary wine hour every evening!",nan,1,ex3065
expedia,"Friendly helpful staff and excellent location. Room was clean and nice but bathroom was disappointing at this price. Small amount of mold in grout in shower was present but otherwise bathroom was very clean. The next day after leaving, I called the hotel and lost & found 3 times looking for phone accessories possibly left in room but was unable to get a response or call back from anyone at hotel.",nan,1,ex3066

expedia,"Location is absolutely brillant: on the river, walking distance to pretty much everything. Nice hotel in great condition with friendly staff. Only downside is the next building under massive construction which means week days early wake up...",nan,1,ex3068
expedia,My stay was wonderful even though I was mislead when booking thinking I was getting something I wasn't.,nan,1,ex3069

expedia,"Excellent staff, very pleasant.The room doors are paper thin and allow too much noise, even though I was at the end of a hall.",nan,1,ex3072
expedia,"I once set a personal goal to stay in every hotel in Chicago for one night. I have been to about 30. I have since abandoned that goal. I now prefer to stay at Hotel Monaco whenever I am downtown. Besides having an ideal location, it is moderately priced, quiet and serves free wine at 5pm. Perfect.",nan,1,ex3073

expedia,We went for the Marathon and we have been really pleased at the Monaco,nan,1,ex3075
expedia,"The hotel is in a fanastic location, get the river view room. They have a large window seat to view the river and the city. It's within walking to many major attractions. Restaurants are on site, but there are also many great restaurants outside the hotel doors within walking distance. My only gripe is that I booked this hotel via Expedia and the hotel won't honor the Kimpton Points because it was booked on a third party site. It will definitely change my view on where I stay in the future because I was a loyal Kimpton customer, but to not credit someone because of where they booked is absurd. I still stayed at their property and I'm sure they still got $$$ from Expedia for the booking. Seems minor.",nan,1,ex3076
expedia,"A nice break from the Hilton, etc. large-scale type of hotel stay. Staff was very friendly and helpful, and the rooms were well appointed and comfortable.

expedia,"Loved this hotel! Staff was very helpful with our car, bags, restaurant recommendations, special requests, etc. Loved the window seat in the room - nice place to relax, see the river and activity below.

We left our car with the valet and walked everywhere for 3 days!",nan,1,ex3078

expedia,"It's a welcoming hotel - I arrived just as wine time began, and they were keen for me to join in. Room was big and clean and warm and quiet. A few small things could have been better, but nothing to spoil the stay. Staff were helpful. And what a wonderful location.",nan,1,ex3083

expedia,"I came here for my birthday with a couple of friends, and this hotel was just perfect for the occasion. We only stayed one night, but days later I still miss our room. The room was standard, but very spacious with noticiabley high ceilings that added to the comfort. Noise levels were low. The mini bar was stocked well. Water pressure excellent and shower easy to use. The hotel is updated but didnt have a cold modern feel like some places tend to have. The decor is cute, and gives it a nice boutique feel. After this impromptu stay, I was pleasantly surprised with the hotel and would stay here, or any other Kimpton hotel again. Thanks!!",nan,1,ex3086

expedia,Love the window seat. Rooms were very nice and bed comfortable.,nan,1,ex3088
expedia,"The staff was fantastic, the room immaculate (they got us in for wine hour at the last moment!). Decor was a little offbeat but I guess that's their thing. I give four stars only because there were no plugs at the nightstands. These days, that is a requirement.",nan,1,ex3089
expedia,"Rooms were larger than most downtown hotels. Hotel was close to shopping, eating, and entertainment. Less than half of the channels came in, the toilet didn't flush right, and even after paying for WiFi had trouble connecting multiple devices.",nan,1,ex3090

expedia,"Nice and clean, staff was really nice. Great location, everything in walking distance.",nan,1,ex3094
expedia,"Overall great experience. The first room I was given had a great view of the river and city, but was facing the street. There was too much noise from the nearby subway (which is above-ground in that area). But the hotel staff was exceptionally accommodating in allowing me to change to a different room on the opposite side of the hotel which was incredibly quiet and comfortable. The staff was exceptionally friendly and helpful. I would definitely stay there again. Great location - right in downtown Chicago and within walking distance to gorgeous Lake Michigan.",nan,1,ex3095

expedia,I thought the hotel lacked amenities for the price,nan,1,ex3102
expedia,If it's available get a room with a water view. One of my favorite hotels ever!,nan,1,ex3103
expedia,Great location for touring the Loop area. The train is close and grabbing a taxi was a cinch. Lots to do within walking distance too. Traveled late August. Have never been in Chicago in summer. So much to do and see. Had a wonderful mother/ daughter trip and would do it again. Been in other hotels in area and this was definitely a solid 4 star. The fitness well above average and house keeping did a nice job maintaininig room. Hotel Monaco is an older hotel with modern amenities.,nan,1,ex3104
expedia,"Hotel Monaco, is a nice boutique hotel. It was in excellent condition. The staff was pleasant. The room decor was very nice. The window seats were a bonus that was utilized by our two age 16 girls. The shower was a problem though. I don't know if we happened to get a handicap shower, or perhaps all rooms are this way. But the shower floor slopes out, and there only was a shower curtain. The water poured over the shower floor edge causing a large part of the bathroom floor to get soaked, as well as the floor mat and any towels on the floor. The water ran all the way across the room to the bathroom door. It was a pain. The parking was outrageously expensive.",nan,1,ex3105

expedia,"Made reservation for travel for myself and two other colleagues. Made flight and hotel reservation through Expedia two weeks ahead of time. Confirmed both day before travel. Took clients out to happy hour and dinner after work and arrived at hotel only to be told ""Expedia overbooked our hotel."" First, if you communicate correctly with Expedia, there's no way to ""overbook."" Next morning, manager basically told me they hope that someone won't show up when that situation happens. (Same manager who still hasn't returned my calls!) Entire city was sold out so they could ""relocate"" us back at the airport that evening. FOR A PRE-PAID, CONFIRMED HOTEL RESERVATION! THEY ALREADY HAD MY MONEY AND STILL GAVE MY ROOMS AWAY!",nan,1,ex3108
expedia,"The hotel is central (walking/biking distance) to visiting the Willis Tower, Navy Pier, Magnificent Mile, and lots of restaurants. Our room was spacious and luxurious. I was concerned that being on the third floor we would hear the street noise, but that was not the case. The room was comfortable and clean. The staff friendly and helpful. Our stay here had us wishing we could stay longer. We had breakfast at the attached restaurant and it was delightful. We will plan to stay here on our next visit to Chicago. The hotel does not have a spa, but they do have a spa they work with to offer in-room services.",nan,1,ex3109
expedia,"Great location, comfy bed. Helpful, pleasant staff.",nan,1,ex3110
expedia,My husband and I had a wonderful mini-moon (short honeymoon) at the Hotel Monaco. It was everything we could have imagined and more. We loved the lounging nook that overlooked the river and enjoyed breakfast in bed there. The staff was available for everything and anything. They were so friendly and fast. We look forward to going there everytime we stay over in the city. The location was walking distance to all of the places we wanted to go.,nan,1,ex3111
expedia,"I've stayed in the Chicago Monaco before, and it doesn't disappoint. This time I brought my daughter along with me, and she was very impressed. The Decor is elegant, the staff welcoming, and the price is right. I'll go back soon!",nan,1,ex3112
expedia,The hotel looks nothing like the pictures. The bathroom was disgusting. The hallways smelled like body odor and mold. I was extremely disappointed. This was supposed to be a special birthday and we ended up overpaying for a regular hotel room with nothing special about it. We will never go back and would not recommend this hotel.,nan,1,ex3113
expedia,The service here was fantastic and the rooms are great. This is a fantastic option for anyone who wants to stay downtown for a reasonable price.,nan,1,ex3114
expedia,"This is our second time staying at a Kimpton hotel. We stayed at one of their hotels in Boston and absolutely loved it. That is why we chose a Kimpton this time. The Hotel Monaco was fabulous. The rooms were very clean with great beds, great bedding and towels. The trademark bathrobes are a riot. The evening free wine bar is always a treat as is the constantly filled jugs of cold cucumber or lemon water. A very nice touch after a hot day in the sun. But what really makes the hotel special was their staff. Not only were they very professional and knowledgable but they were really genuine in their kindness. They always put in an extra effort to assist whenever they could. Whenever we travel through the states again we will always check to see if their is a Kimpton hotel in the area where we can stay. Thank you hotel Monaco.",nan,1,ex3115
expedia,The hotel staff was friendly and courteous. Room was very clean. Good experience.,nan,1,ex3116
expedia,I really enjoyed my stay at the Hotel Monaco. The location is great as it is just off Michigan Avenue almost at the start of the magnificent mile where South Michigan Avenue becomes North Michigan Avenue so it is close to both all the attractions in grant park at not that far from the museum campus but also close to the attractions on and around the magnificent mile and not that far from Lincoln park. There is CTA station on pretty much every line within a short walk. The staff were friendly and the wine tasting hour between 5 and 6 pm is a nice bonus if you are in the hotel at the time.,nan,1,ex3117
expedia,"Our stay in Hotel Monaco (4 days) was very enjoyable. The staff was exceptionally helpful. We had loads of questions for the concierge and staff at the desk. all, from the gentleman managing the door, the concierge, the staff at the desk to those maintaining the rooms, were as patient as could be in listening and answering appropriately and also being helpful with extra info to our queries. There is wine served at 5 p.m. for all and it is quite a nice reception. One of the three rooms for our group was very large, the others were average. All rooms were quite clean were designed artistically. We felt at home and thoroughly enjoyed it.",nan,1,ex3118
expedia,"Stayed here on a recent business trip to Chicago. The hotel was nice and clean. Rooms were spacious and the internet was reliable. Tall ceilings and window seats were a surprising luxury. I was able to sit in the padded window seat with my laptop and watch the boats cruise up and down the river. Good restaurants near by, very central to everything in the city. Parking was a bit of a chore. Just be forewarned, it is $56 per night for parking but I think that is to be expected downtown.",nan,1,ex3119
expedia,"Our family of 4 LOVES this hotel! We visit Chicago fairly often & have tried other hotels in the Loop & GOld Coast area. After years of experimenting, we concluded Hotel Monaco is our best option. The price is certainly not budget-friendly but it is ""reasonable"" for a hotel of this caliber in the Loop. The staff is wonderful, the location is so convenient, the decor is beautiful, & the rooms are fantastic. The size of the rooms is quite impressive for CHicago hotels in this price range.",nan,1,ex3120
expedia,Great hotel,nan,1,ex3121

expedia,"The view from the window on the city is awesome. Especially the the mini bed that is set against the window, it gives a great view.",nan,1,ex3123
expedia,Room was a nice size for a city hotel and included a window seat that you could look out on the river from your room.,nan,1,ex3124

expedia,"It was my first rip to Chicago and the Hotel Monaco helped make it an amazing trip. The location was perfect. So close to everything I wanted to see, the Bean, the river, the plaza with the Picaso, the Willis tower, and more. They had loaner bikes for a ride along the river. I was able to do yoga Inu room which helped prepare for walking through Chicago. And best of all I got a gold fish for my room :) Oh, and the gym was nice",nan,1,ex3128
expedia,The hotel was beautiful and was nicely located among many attractions. We parked our car and took the L or walked to anywhere we wanted. I would highly recommend this because the traffic patterns are crazy. The service was quick and friendly everyone was always willing to answer questions or make suggestions for us. The window seat in the room was incredible and big enough for two people to lay comfortably. I would return 100%,nan,1,ex3129
expedia,Convenient check-in and clean rooms with high quality appointments. Great location obviously and the hotel doesn't take this for granted and let service slip down a notch. The front desk was easy to speak with and the bar in the restaurant downstairs was excellent! I ordered an Old Fashioned and it was one of the best I've had. Would stay here again.,nan,1,ex3130
expedia,Staff was very friendly. Hotel is beautiful. I loved my stay and I loved the few from my room.,nan,1,ex3131
expedia,Great hotel location but room location within hotel makes a big difference. Can hear conversation in next room thru common adjoining doors.,nan,1,ex3132
expedia,"The hotel overall was unbelievable, from the front desk help to the concierge. We actually picked it off of a Hotels.com recommendation and could not have been more pleased.",nan,1,ex3133
expedia,Hotel was great but they put us in a room that destruction/construction of a building across from our window was taking place. it started at 6:00 am on Saturday morning after we had enjoyed a Friday night out. Since I went through a third party they could not adjust my bill.,nan,1,ex3134
expedia,Personnel was very nice...room was decorated very nice..wall mirror frame needed a good cleaning it was very dusty...easy access to bay window seat was not good at all..I had to climb on the chase lounge to get up there and down..Not good at all for 2 seniors..River view that was seen on advertisement online wasn't available unless you had a room at the corner of the building. Which I didn't have..Location was great for attending the theater.....,nan,1,ex3135
expedia,Quieter than some of the other major streets around that area. Beautiful interior with high end finishes. Staff friendly and attentive.,nan,1,ex3136
expedia,"The hotel was very nice. I would definitely come back here on my next trip to Chicago. They give free wireless internet after filling out a brief form (name, address, pillow preference, etc.). They welcome pets, although we didn't test this out on this occasion. Also, perhaps most valuable to us on this trip, they are within 3 city blocks from every subway line. The room was considerably larger than other hotels that I have stayed at in Chicago (in the same price range). The view was considerably less impressive than others, though.",nan,1,ex3137
expedia,"Very nice and new accommodations. Keurig coffee in the room (on request) was a plus. Concierge was a bit stuffy but rest of the staff was very friendly and helpful. Great location, too.",nan,1,ex3138
expedia,"Unfortunate experience. The photos looked very promising, but reality was different.",nan,1,ex3139
expedia,"Very pleasant staff and lovely room with huge window seat overlooking the river. The bathroom was very basic, though. Major drawback was noise from the el train. Also, free wifi should be included!",nan,1,ex3140
expedia,"The staff was AMAZING. So helpful and thoughtful! Only two nights, but a great stay.",nan,1,ex3141
expedia,"This was the first time we have stayed at a Kimpton property and we were very impressed! The location was perfect for everything we wanted to do, from the architectural cruise on the Chicago River to a walk to Millenium Park. The rooms were lovely but the best feature was the comfy cushioned window seat with a view of the sparkling river (although we could have done without the huge TRUMP sign on the adjacent skyscraper -- UGLY and unnecessary.). The staff was friendly and accommodating, the concierge was helpful with arranging for tickets, and best of all was the wine social in the lobby from 5-6 pm with free drinks. You can't go wrong with this hotel. Highly recommend the king room with the window seats on one of the higher floors.",nan,1,ex3142

Centrally located so easy accessibility to all kinds of sights to see.

Definitely would go back and will be recommending to friends.",nan,1,ex3144

Easy to get to several great meals, visiting the sites we wanted to see (two blocks from Millennium Park), and shopping on Michigan Avenue. The hotel was terrific; great service from the concierge (perfect recommendations on Chicago deep dish pizza), and the room was outstanding with bay windows to views of the Chicago River and downtown vistas. A memorable visit!",nan,1,ex3147

expedia,Overall the trip was wonderful! The staff at hotel monaco could not have been more accomadating. I love the hotel!

I will be going back to hotel monaco,nan,1,ex3149

expedia,"Hotel Monaco was a major part of the Chicago town experience. It helped make Chicago very enjoyable. I would return again. I have never rated a hotel all fives. This one deserved it. I cannot think of a negative experience, except parking is challenging, but it is like that everywhere in Chicago major.",nan,1,ex3152
expedia,"This is my second time there, first time was for business. This time I took the wife and kids there for a week on vacation. We got a river view room And requested a high floor room so the kids would enjoy the view. They gave us the 9th floor, the view was awesome an the kids loved the window beds. Also the weekday daytime doorman is great. So nice , helpful an great to deal with everytime I talked to him. Love this place and can't wait to go back.",nan,1,ex3153

expedia,"My wife and I decided to get away for the 4th of July weekend, we found Hotel Monoco and loved it. THe location was great for walking to amenities, the hotel was quirky cool, the wine reception was great; teh only down side was teh $56/night parking with no other options in sight.",nan,1,ex3155

expedia,One of the best beds I have ever slept on. The staff were amazing and accommodating. The hotel and the room are beautiful and unique. I will definitely be staying here again. The hotel is in close proximity to many downtown attractions and great restaurants. Highly recommended.,nan,1,ex3163
expedia,The Hotel Monaco is in a great location if this is your first visit to Chicago because it is within walking distance of many Chicago highlights and sights that first time visitors want to see. The staff was more than friendly and bent over backward to make certain our stay was pleasant and stress free! Would definitely stay there again!,nan,1,ex3164
expedia,We had a very enjoyable first time visit to Chicago. We will return and probably stay at this same hotel.

expedia,"My wife and I stayed a week. Except for the doorman who gave us wrong directions to a popular restaurant, the stay was just about flawless. Even the restaurant, which we thought we would avoid when we arrived, proved to be very satisfactory one night when it was raining too hard to go anywhere else. The doorman's error cost us two unnecessary cab fares and wasted valuable vacation time But he apologized and no real harm was done So we recommend the hotel very highly, but in the future we will always prefer Google Maps over the advice of a doorman.",nan,1,ex3167

expedia,Too much street noise in room 206. Bad view No liner in ice bucket,nan,1,ex3169
expedia,"We had a wonderful stay at the Monaco. Room was very big and very comfortable, staff was friendly, elevators were fast. On thing, we were facing the parking garage and could hear the train in the distance. I actually liked hearing the sound of the train but if you want quiet, ask to be on the other side of the hotel.",nan,1,ex3170
expedia,"My family and I enjoyed our stay at the Hotel Monaco. We had requested a large room and they were true to their word. The view was a brick wall but they did ask what kind of room we wanted ahead to time and we opted for the larger room than a view. Check in was a breeze. The room was very clean and spacious but the make-up mirror was falling off the wall, the sheet had a hole in it and the wooden soap dish has large gouges in it. Not a big deal but these are noticable things that can be corrected. The restuarant in the hotel was very good and the service was fairly attentive. Location was right in the Loop and close to many of the attractions. We were able to walk to Michigan Ave. and Navy Pier. I would go back to this hotel as the positives outweigh any negatives.",nan,1,ex3171
expedia,"Excellent location, close to Loop, Millenium Park, river. L nearby could be heard more loudly than ideal but not a huge problem. There was a very loud wedding party on our floor with a piglet on a leash ""incident"" which caused quite a rucus one night. There seemed to be cleanup happening after the party which lasted into the wee hours of the morning (2-3am) which kept us awake that night. It sounded like they were throwing furniture around in there. Otherwise, w had a nice stay. Our friends stayed at the Fairmont Millenium for about the same rate and that was a much more luxurious hotel.",nan,1,ex3172
expedia,"An upgrade for a 'river view room' was a bit deceptive. If you are above the 5th floor, you may see a sliver during day time, but through VERY dirty windows. When we spent the extra money for the room and were placed on the 3rd floor with a mostly neighboring building view, a comment was made. The hotel staff quickly offered us a different floor and made things better. If you want a river view, this is probably not the hotel for you. The hotel itself was clean. The staff was fabulous.",nan,1,ex3173
expedia,"Great views, staff, walking distance to everything! Concierge Ryan was amazing and the staff was helpful in every way. I would just advise not bringing a car. $56 a night to park and most everything is walking distance and you can use Uber instead of stinky Cabs! Or use the hotel or city's rental bikes! The staff was so excited about our getting married as well and treated us so special! Oh, and free wine from six to seven pm!",nan,1,ex3174
expedia,"why I booked this hotel just because I love the bay window and the view in the photo. But it is really not like the photo. I booked the regular king bed room with the price more than $200. There is no soft-decorated bay window in my room and in front of our window there is a old in construct building, about 20 feet? no river view unless you would like pay 100 bucks more to switch to suit or high level room. But if you just try to find somewhere with convenient transportation and large bed, it should be a good option. Only take 5 minutes walk to the ""cloud gate"" :)",nan,1,ex3175
expedia,A nice place near downtown for a reasonable rate. The connected restaurant was good and breakfast was served faster than anyplace I'd been and I had the check before I finished. It was like they knew you didn't have time to spend eating and needed to be on your way. A good place for business travelers and I'll stay there again.,nan,1,ex3176
expedia,We picked this hotel because of the window seats! It was really nice. The staff was so very helpful and kind in every way. You are right on the Chicago River and an easy walk to the Magnificent Mile and Millenium Park and Navy Pier. Would highly recommend this hotel.,nan,1,ex3177
expedia,"Great location, great room, great staff! Would definitely stay at Hotel Monaco again in the future.",nan,1,ex3178

expedia,I travel quite often and I must say I was impressed by the quality of service at the Hotel Monaco. Nothing was difficult for the concierge or the reception people. From the moment we arrived we felt we were welcome. The hotel style is not according to my preference but that is a different story. I find their policy of taking care of guests excellent and I wish to thank them for our comfortable stay at their hotel.,nan,1,ex3180

expedia,Great Boutique Hotel..,nan,1,ex3185
expedia,"This hotel group use to be fantastic, but simply have fallen behind. Way overpriced, dated interiors, room amenities are stale and the tiger print robes laughable. There are so many hotels in Chicago that blow this place away. Check out the Peninsula and spend a little more. That hotel blows this place away! Kimpton was always known for great reataurabt properties on site. The restaurant attached to this hotel was terrible. Lighting in the restaurant appeared to be set at full bright with no Manager in site.",nan,1,ex3186

expedia,"Great location--close to Michigan Avenue, Art Institute and shopping. The rooms are comfortable, decor is lovely. The wine reception every night is the best.

expedia,"All was wonderful except for what is considered the usual comfort component in a room....no comfy upholstered chair with a reading lamp in the room, perhaps because of the very wonderful window seats which are deep and pillowed but at nite lack any lighting by which to sit and read or engage in hobby of choice...a wall lite in the window seating would be a true plus. The window seating also requires that individual be either 7 foot tall or rather athletic...no step stool provided and they are very high off the floor! Otherwise....we continue to return!",nan,1,ex3197
expedia,"I was visiting Chicago to attend two different work conferences, both downtown but in opposite directions. The location of Hotel Monaco was great. It was close enough to everything downtown that I could walk to both my work conferences as well as to shopping (Macy's, etc.) and the theater district. There were plenty of restaurants (such as Catch Thirty Five) within walking distance as well. The room was clean and spacious. I was able to check in early. The bed was very comfortable. It felt like a very fun, trendy hotel. The staff were all extremely friendly and helped me find cabs, get directions, etc. The best part was a 12:00pm checkout time. I will definitely stay at this hotel (or any Kimpton hotel) again.",nan,1,ex3198
expedia,It was nice and close to my conference venue as well as the other sights.,nan,1,ex3199
expedia,Hotel room was roomy. Staff was very friendly. Thought room service was average at best. lacked choices and no menu in room. had to call for one.,nan,1,ex3200
expedia,My sisters and I had such an awesome stay. The staff was friendly and helpful. The rooms were spacious and clean. The location was central to everything in Chicago. I will definitely stay there again.,nan,1,ex3201
expedia,"The location, the gorgeous rooms, the staff, the wine reception and coffee bar made this a perfect hotel. I particularly enjoyed waking up and sitting in the cozy window seats overlooking Chicago. A great memory.",nan,1,ex3202
expedia,"I would like to say, as a person that travels alot, that my stay was at the Hotel Monaco was great. I prefer to stay at Kimpton Hotels when I have a chance and the Hotel Monaco in Chicago was wonderful. Staff very accommodating and pleasant. Amenities were many. Would love to come back for a stay when I am in Chicago.",nan,1,ex3203
expedia,"I couldn't have asked for better service, nicer people or a nicer place to stay! My overall experience with Chicago's Hotel Monoco was absolutely perfect in every way!!",nan,1,ex3204
expedia,Hotel was great. Centrally located and doorman Michael was awesome. Would highly recommend.,nan,1,ex3205
expedia,"Nice hotel. Rooms well appointed. Staff was very pleasant. We were able to check in very early (around noon), which was a pleasant surprise. No pool or hot tub, which is fine with me, but would probably be a disappoitment to kids...thus the tile. Didn't eat in the restaurant, so can't comment there. I would definitely stay here again.",nan,1,ex3206
expedia,"The hotel is a historical figure in Chicago that has gone through over a million dollar renovation. However, the standard room is a little on the tight side and would have enjoyed a tub in the bathroom. The room we stayed in had a snag in the carpet that had sharp pieces of staples coming out. We expressed the issue after stepping on it and we were compensated with a complimentary breakfast in their restaurant. The day we stayed was filled with events so the hotel and everywhere else around was hummming with people. So if you are planning on visiting this lovely city, I encourage you to book your reservation way in advanced. The plus side to this is where the hotel is located, it is in the heart of it all in my opinion, there are bikes for rent in almost every corner to enjoy the city without having to break your wallet.",nan,1,ex3207
expedia,Over-all good experience. Front desk acted skeptical when I questioned a charge from the in-room bar.,nan,1,ex3208
expedia,"My husband and I were in Chicago to visit our daughter for Mother's Day. The Millennium Knickerbocker was so close to the bus stop we needed to catch, making it very easy to navigate our way around the city with out having to pay cab fare constantly.",nan,1,ex3209
expedia,Friendly and welcoming atmosphere. Great historic location in the best part of the city.,nan,1,ex3210

expedia,"We were treated as royalty. We were given free martinis and appetizer at the gorgeous hotel bar while we waited for our room to be prepared. Furthermore, the staff was outstanding at every hour of our stay",nan,1,ex3213
expedia,"My husband and I can happily check Chicago off our bucket list with smiles. From the start, our surprise upgrade to a suite set the tone. The hotel was clean, room was very comfy, from the bedding to the room size. A martini bar is located in the lobby manned by the cordial Humberto and the concierge desk is manned by the best concierge we've ever encountered. Sheryl helped us plan our 3 days so that we made the most of our trip. She was a gem and was invaluable to the success of our trip. The hotel is located around the block from the John Hancock Building (great brunch on the 95th floor) and within walking distance to Lake Shore Drive and the beach. Don't miss the Architectural Cruise on the Chicago River or the free Lincoln Park Zoo amongst all the other attractions. Loved it!",nan,1,ex3214
expedia,"The was very friendly and helpful ,they were very attentive and more importantly they were knowledgeable",nan,1,ex3215
expedia,"We had a great experience here, the accommodations were fantastic, they let us check in early at no charge which was great. The staff was very pleasant too! The only downside is that they charge for Wi-Fi which is crazy in this day and age.",nan,1,ex3216
expedia,"Very comfortable bed in a well-located historic hotel. We had a room right beside the elevators and were concerned about noise. As it turned out, noise was not a problem. The bed was exceptionally comfortable in the standard room. As an older hotel, there were some things that were a bit worn. However , overall it was a very good stay. I would have granted more stars in the facilities category if there were better in-hotel restaurant options. The hotel has a martini bar (with a limited food menu) and a breakfast restaurant. There was no room service option other than delivery from external restaurants (that were advertised in the room)",nan,1,ex3217
expedia,"Excellent staff, beautiful historic hotel. Due to historic nature, rooms are small but renovated and well appointed. Bathrooms are well done but dimly lit. A lighted makeup mirror would be helpful. Great location for walking, catching a cab and 6 blocks from a red line station",nan,1,ex3218
expedia,"Staff are friendly and helpful, hotel condition is ok as far as an old facility goes, the fan in one of my bathrooms wasn't working, for one night stay, I didn't bother to call the front desk. Other than that, it was good experience.",nan,1,ex3219
expedia,"I have been staying here for 30 years. Incredible staff and best location in Chicago. Rooms are spotless, concierge is the best in the industry. The doormen spectacular. Best best bar staff in the world. And location is where you want to be.",nan,1,ex3220
expedia,The room was uncomfortably warm and we tried to adjust the thermostat to cool. Even at 65 the cool air would not come on. When we asked the desk we were told it would only work depending on the temperature outside. What that had to do with anything we could not understand and were told to open a window or that they would send up a fan.,nan,1,ex3221
expedia,"The old Knickerbocker has a lovely lobby and a marvelous Crystal ballroom. The bar area is very comfortable and calm, with fine service and good food. It's a cosy hotel at a good price. The location at the top of the Magnificent Mile (North Michigan Ave.) is convenient for shopping and restaurants, and it's an easy 20 minute walk to the river (if that) with lots of buses and cabs, if you're in a hurry.",nan,1,ex3222
expedia,"The hotle room was beautiful, clean, and well kept. The bathroom facilities were wonderful although I am not a big fan of the rainfall showerheads. The hotel does not have in-room dining services but the bar and restaurant are great. Overall, this was a great place to stay.",nan,1,ex3223
expedia,"I loved this hotel, but did not like that they would not change my original accommodations after one of my party was unable to join us.",nan,1,ex3224
expedia,"We stayed at the Knickerbocker for our first anniversary, and our first time staying downtown. It was just off of the Mag Mile, and the location was great! Quiet enough, and the old buildings are so beautiful. Highly recommend this hotel, and am looking forward to the next time I can stay there. Room was smaller than expected, but very nice nonetheless.",nan,1,ex3225
expedia,"Hotel was a nice experience, good location for getting around to various attractions by walking, bus and subway. Only draw back is no breakfast and you had to pay for anything extra such as Wi-Fi. Staff was helpful but not overly friendly. Room was a bit small but the bed was fantastic.",nan,1,ex3226
expedia,"Nice location. But, very mediocre hotel. The lobby is so generic, not welcoming, concierge rarely there, checkin desk tucked away and hard to find. I don't think anyone should pay for wifi when staying in an expensive hotel. Would not stay here again.",nan,1,ex3227
expedia,"Great experience and location. Great Walking distrance to restaurants, train stations, Michigan avenue, etc.",nan,1,ex3228
expedia,Great! Very clean. Very organized. Cozy lobby with piano music. Central to everywhere in downtown Chicago.,nan,1,ex3229
expedia,"The hotel staff, most notably the management, do not seem to care one bit about you or your concerns. The exceptions were the restaurant staff (wonderful food and professional service) and the bartender, who was very helpful. The room had no air conditioning. We were told it was because ""it's not hot season yet, so the A/C isn't turned on yet...this is a very old building."" This was our honeymoon, and we hoped to receive the ""4-Diamond"" service for which dearly paid. This was a huge problem. We both agreed that the staff and amenities at the airport hotel we used the night before flying to Chicago were nicer than the Knickerbocker. Also, the remote hardly worked, and the channel selection was very limited. This wasn't so much a problem for us, as we were on our honeymoon and didn't watch much TV. Just FYI, though; some people like TV, and theirs was sub-par. The place smelled funny. There was no ice machine on our floor. The water pressure was terrible. The toilet would hardly flush. The bed was too soft (probably worn out). The bathroom was barely well-lit enough to shave. They wouldn't allow for a late checkout, even though we offered to pay for it. NOBODY GAVE A HOOT that it was our honeymoon. They covered all the bases with the ""sir, we apologize,"" etc., but it was clear that nearly nobody really cared if we were there or not. We paid good money. We had an awesome trip regardless. However, the hotel did not in any way contribute positively to our experience.",nan,1,ex3230

expedia,"Centraal gelegen (Gold Coast) nabij de Navy Pier en de Magnificent Mile. Lekker rustig, goede kamer en vriendelijk personeel. Nadeel was de hoge prijs voor dagelijks internet op de kamer (niet meer van deze tijd). In de Lobby was wifi gratis.",nan,1,ex3244
expedia,"Nice, modern decor in hotel room with pleasant staff.",nan,1,ex3245
expedia,"My husband and I stayed at the Millenium Knickerbocker as a stay-cation during my spring break. The doormen greeted us in a very friendly manner and check in was smooth and quick. They even checked us in early. The room was small but clean and the bed was comfortable. It would have been nice to have a chair to sit in for reading or watching tv other than the desk chair. The curtains hid the terrible view, but I guess we didn't go there to stay in the room. Which brings me to the best part of our stay - the hotel's location. It is close to the lakefront, the beach, great restaurant, tons of shopping and public transportation. We discovered a great restaurant just a block away on Walton called Doc B's Fresh Kitchen and revisited a fabulous Belgian bakery on Walton for their extra special chocolate almond croissants. Yum! If you are looking for a breakfast or lunch with a view, go to Oak Tree, it's on the 7th floor of the 900 N Michigan shops. We would definitely stay there again.",nan,1,ex3246
expedia,"Great hotel to serve as a base for enjoying Chicago's Miracle Mile! Got an early check in and had two really nice rooms with the most comfortable hotel beds experienced in years. The lobby bar had a Friday night piano player, followed later by a jazz trio, and large screen TVs for sporting events. Although we caused a minor accident with broken glass in the lobby, Junior Therriauix, the manager on duty, eased the tension with humor and took care of us and the mess, allowing us to remember why staying at a great hotel enables great memories. The 80+ year old conciegre is wealth of knowledge who provided information obout restaurants and travel that allowed us to take advantage of things we otherwise would have missed. Definitely worth a return visit!",nan,1,ex3247
expedia,"Nice hotel... Clean, comfortable, and great location!",nan,1,ex3248
expedia,Everything great except for the fact that room wifi is not included and costs $11/day.,nan,1,ex3249
expedia,"When I booked, complimentary wi-fi was supposed to be included. When I arrived, it was not. Edward at the Front Desk fixed that for me without a question. He was fantastic! The room was nice, but you could hear everything in the hall and a good portion of the neighbors. The bed was one of the best ever. Housekeeping didn't come until after 5pm on the first day, and then the second day was there at 7am - 14 hours later, which was odd. Everyone was very nice and helpful, it's a very clean hotel and room, and the location cannot be better.",nan,1,ex3250
expedia,got there and their system was down couldnt check in until half hour after I got there. Lobby was very nice with piano player. Get up to the room Wifi did not work for 2 days. Sheets smelled like cheap detergent. Ordered a wake up call and nobody even called me. For a 4 star hotel with good reviews it was a joke.,nan,1,ex3251
expedia,"Stayed for 6 nights, the room was comfortable but a bit on the small side from rooms we normally stay in. Staff were very helpful, had a nice breakfast in the hotel on one of our days there. The only complaint I would have was the extra 11 dollars a day for wifi which you need to factor in to your budget if that is an essential",nan,1,ex3252
expedia,Everything was great! The beds were not as comfortable as I would have liked. The staff are very helpful and friendly!,nan,1,ex3253
expedia,"I enjoyed my stay at the Millennium Knickerbocker. The location is pretty good because it's not too far from shopping, the John Hancock building, and some really great restaurants. I also thought the bed was comfy, the room and bathroom were nicely decorated and clean, and the rooms were surprisingly quiet for being so close to Michigan Avenue. My only issues with this hotel are that it's a bit far from the 'L' (maybe a ten minute walk) and the room I was in was kind of small. For one person the room size is fine, but for two I think it would be too cramped. I would still suggest this hotel to friends though and would recommend they upgrade to a larger room if more than one person was going to be in a room. All in all, I would definitely recommend this hotel to someone who wants to be close to some of Chicago's best shopping.",nan,1,ex3254
expedia,"This was a charming hotel to stay at with a great location close to the magnificent mile and many other attractions. The staff was friendly, the room was nice. The only complaint I had was the shower didn't have warm water. I only stayed one night so never called to have it fixed.",nan,1,ex3255
expedia,"The shower in our room leaked, causing all of our luggage and some of the contents to get wet. Upon checking out of our room, I mentioned this to the front desk staff. The employee not only not offered an apology, but seemed inconvenienced by the whole thing.",nan,1,ex3256

expedia,"Nice, great location ! Staff ver friendly, helpful and polite !!!",nan,1,ex3260
expedia,"The high rating and exuberant reviews were a reason for me to book this hotel. It started out good, the hotel is located in north loop, close to many shops, restaurants and pubs. Let's check the ups and downs + Entrance hall is representative and the staff is friendly. - Rooms are mid size, with two and some luggage it fills quickly and a third person would not have a place to sit. - Bathroom is small, with a single person it is completely filled - neighboring rooms can be connected. But sound isolation at these doors is absent and you can follow the conversations in the other room in detail. - no customer washing oppotunities - parking is expensive in Chicago, you pay quickly 40$ a night, this hotel tops that easily and was the most expensive offer I've seen. - on one day we left late, about noon. The room was not cleaned when we returned late evening. + when cleaning is done, it is just fine. + many elevators and you never have to wait long + wifi in room was included!",nan,1,ex3261
expedia,"Staff was poor customer service. Slow check in and checkout. Receipts for stay were incorrect and staff did not know how to correct them.

Staff had poor English.",nan,1,ex3262

expedia,Fabulous decor and amenities. Excellent value. Staff very professional.,nan,1,ex3266
expedia,We didn't spend much time in our room during our weekend in Chicago but the staff and room were to our liking. We had a smaller room without a view but the downtown location made picking up the bus or the red line easy meaning we didn't have to splurge on taxi fare.,nan,1,ex3267
expedia,"This is a really good hotel with a great location. The only complaint I had was the in room bar and lack of vending machines. I don't want to spend $3 to buy a coke. Other than that, everyone was helpful and kind and they were able to give a good recommendation of a quick place to eat. The housekeeping staff was very helpful as well. Overall a great place to stay and somewhere I would stay again.",nan,1,ex3268
expedia,I would recommend this hotel to anyone. The location is great. It's within walking distance to many shops and a couple of museums. The staff are warm and accommodating.

expedia,We booked that hotel for his location and needed a place to sleep and take showers. Total fail! We had a room with 2 double beds. One bed was broken. No hot water. The only thing that the front desk did was to change us room. This time it was taking 20 min to get warm water (not warm/hot enough to wash your hair). I slept better in a 2 stars hotel in a 3rd world country. Be aware that the hotel charges $75 usd/day as a deposit and it takes 3-7 business days for them to refund you after your stay.,nan,1,ex3303

My daughter and I drove however, and parking was outrageous. We were told the parking garage across from the hotel didn't take credit, only cash. That left us with hotel valet parking which for us, was crazy expensive, approaching the cost of our room.

expedia,"Horrible. Rude staff, unclean rooms. We booked a King and were given a queen room. No apology, nothing. Furniture and rooms are dingy and dirty. I would not recommend this place.",nan,1,ex3315
expedia,Great,nan,1,ex3316
expedia,"I work at a five star, five diamond hotel in Beverly Hills, so I expect exceptional service everywhere (including McDonalds) and am rarely satisfied with costumer service now. However, I was quite pleased with the service here, the bellboy was always very helpful and the front desk even upgraded our room for free. Plus there was free pizza and wings at the bar downstairs for the Super Bowl. The drinks at the martini bar were very good also. Would recommend.",nan,1,ex3317
expedia,Great hotel close to Water Tower Place. Easy 6 block walk to the nearest CTA line. Beds were very comfortable.,nan,1,ex3318
expedia,"The hotel is situated in a great location within blocks of Michican Avenue, Oak and the lake. The room was perfectly laid out and spacious for a non-suite.",nan,1,ex3319
expedia,"I will start by admitting that I love the Millennium Knickerbocker. I love the feel, the ambiance, and the location. The small bar feels like it is there just for me. The only unfortunate part is that the place is starting to look a little threadbare, little worn out. Some updates would do nicely. There are too many other options available to let these little things go by unnoticed.",nan,1,ex3320

expedia,"My husband and I flew in for a brief trip to Indiana. He was coming for an interview, and I tagged along to spend a few days with our daughters and grandson. We only stayed one night at the Knickerbocker, but the entire stay was second to none! Extremely attentive and friendly staff, immaculate room, and delicious dining all contributed to me rating the hotel as A 5-star establishment!",nan,1,ex3324

expedia,"The hotel has charm with updated modern feel in parts. Our door was busted, as the spring did not work, so the door would slam shut every time. Also, we clumsily left our tablet behind, amidst the chaos of the winter storm at the hotel and lost and found 'claim' they couldn't locate it. Also couldn't check in for our flights because the computers in the business centers were slow, and also didn't recognize the airline website.",nan,1,ex3327
expedia,"What a beautiful hotel! Easy to get to taking public transportation from MDW. Near the Water Tower and Cheesecake Factory (yum)! Hotel restaurant has amazing food for reasonable prices. Room was gorgeous with lighted closet, safe, mini bar, and bathroom. Rooms are updates nicely with a rain shower I indulged in! I would definitely stay there again the next time I travel to Chicago.",nan,1,ex3328
expedia,"Great hotel at a great price! We were even given a more spacious room due to a birthday weekend visit and a lack of peak season traffic! My only complaint would be noisy neighbors at times, but nothing the hotel could necessarily control, and it wasn't enough to keep us awake or too disturbed.",nan,1,ex3329
expedia,"The hotel was very nice and updated for an older hotel. We got a great rate on Expedia which made it even better! The service at the hotel restaurant was very slow, but the food was good.",nan,1,ex3330
expedia,"I wanted to do something special for my girlfriend's birthday and found a great deal on this historically spectacular hotel. We got exactly what we expected. Beautiful hotel, comfortable bed, fantastic location. My only suggestion would be for the shower head(s) to be updated. It wasn't my favorite set-up. But it wouldn't keep me from staying there again!",nan,1,ex3331

We would definitely stay again !! John n Denise,nan,1,ex3337
expedia,"Came into Chicago for almost a week. The Knickerbocker was the perfect hotel. It had the class and sophistication of Chicago combined with modern chic decor. Everything about the hotel was great. SOME of the front desk crew weren't the most welcoming but other than that, I'd definitely recommend it to anyone.",nan,1,ex3338
expedia,"Great historic hotel, great location! Rooms are a bit small for space surrounding a King size bed, but great value for rate. Overall very pleased with stay and would definitely recommend it.",nan,1,ex3339

expedia,"Very nice hotel, room a bit small, but to be expected in an older hotel. Service was excellent and accomodating. Very clean room. Shower was a joke, terrible water pressure. Parking nuts, almost as much as our room rate, ridiculous, but that's Chicago. I just don't get it. Elevators a bit slow too.",nan,1,ex3342
expedia,"I was looking for an opportunity to see friends in Chicago, and a great price on a great hotel seemed like just the ticket. It's very close to many different things in River North, and it's only 14 stories, so it's not a mega-hotel. Everything is fairly modern, except for the elevators, and that's more about style than anything.",nan,1,ex3343
expedia,Most beautiful hotel lobby !,nan,1,ex3344
expedia,"The bell guys were great - remembered us as we went in and out and very friendly. Sam, the person who checked us in, was also very pleasant. The only downside to this hotel is the elevator bank. Of the 3 elevators only 1 was working on Sunday morning which made for a LONG wait!",nan,1,ex3345
expedia,Stay was wonderful and good location. Room was a little smaller than I expected. Elevators were very slow and had to take the stairs twice.,nan,1,ex3346

expedia,Amazing hotel close to everything. Excellent staff friendly and very helpful. Highly recommended.,nan,1,ex3356
expedia,"Room was not as advertised (did not have tub), phone cover kept falling off (cheap), remote for TV worked sporadically, manager at first refused to provide a room as advertised with no ""upgrade"" charge and then stated would take room from another guest and deal with them separately (we did not want to displace another guest), new room was not stocked with shampoo (took over 10 minutes to receive), accidentally left bottle of wine in first room and, when requested to see if it could be retrieved was told it was probably thrown out ... just an overall disappointing and frustrating experience. Oh, and first room did not have hot water in shower and were told it was because the room had not been occupied recently so hot water was not easily reaching that floor. Did ultimately receive full comp (upon information and belief ... still need to confirm credit card/bank account) but only after lengthy, unnecessary, and persistent complaining. Considering the overall competition for hotels in downtown Chicago, we expected better customer service. Will not stay here again.",nan,1,ex3357
expedia,"We had a great time. The hotel was cozy and comforting. The condition was great, we only had a problem trying to get the hot water to work. What the hotel lacked in hot water delivery they made up for with everything else. We walked every where, most places are within the mile.",nan,1,ex3358
expedia,Good stay. Solid performance by all. Great location. Great price considering the neighborhood. Room small but clean. Not a lot of modern services but for under $100 it's a great option. Old-fashioned but nice.,nan,1,ex3359
expedia,We always have a great time when we stay there. Location is excellent and the best bang for the buck in that area. Hotel lobby bar is q special place.,nan,1,ex3360
expedia,Very nice place. Great service. Great martinis. Very clean and classy.,nan,1,ex3361
expedia,Excellent hotel for the price. Double rooms much bigger than King room. Got a corner room with double windows. Hotel staff very nice and eager to please. When I mentioned I was high maintainable and to please give me a nice room he put us in the corner room ;) can't hurt to ask :) lobby was ok but nothing beautiful to look at. That was really my only complaint. Very convenient to all. Mich ave 1/2 block away. Great history at hotel. Try to make the tour on Friday at 3. We missed it but wish we didn't! Kids loved the 'secret' passages.,nan,1,ex3362

expedia,"I booked a one night stay at the Knickerbocker on a Saturday for me and my boyfriend for his birthday. The location is very close to the train so it was very easy for us to get to the hotel without a car. The hotel is surrounded by great restaurants, shopping, bars, and other great attractions like cafe's, salons, coffee shops, etc. Our room was on the 11th floor and it was absolutely perfect for us. Our room had a very comfortable king size bed, a jacuzzi bathtub, flat screen tv with HBO movies that we watched all night, a full stocked fridge, and our view was nice too. We got dinner at the Cheesecake Factory which was a 3 minute walk from our hotel.",nan,1,ex3379
expedia,Very pleased with my stay. I enjoyed how clean this hotel was.,nan,1,ex3380
expedia,"Had a room on the 11th floor that included a slice view of the lake. I was expecting the room to be loud as it was around the corner from the elevators, but in reality (or maybe I was one of few occupied rooms on this floor) I slept wonderfully with no interruptions. In the morning, the shower took 20 minutes for hot water but since it was before 6AM I didn't take this as a detraction since I was probably one of the first to run the water on this floor.",nan,1,ex3381
expedia,"The hotel staff was very welcoming and accommodating. We were able to check in early and book an additional night. The hot water in the hotel room was very irregular and often times warm at best. The sound on the t.v. worked on all channels except HBO. We called the front desk and had a quick and pleasant visit with an engineer, he looked into and had it fixed within 45 minutes. Overall a very good experience.",nan,1,ex3382
expedia,I loved the stay and you want to known why because my wife loved it so a happy wife a happy life.,nan,1,ex3383
expedia,"Not far from the shopping district. Parking is $28 dollars overnight, more for valet. Rooms are clean, minus the vent when you first walk into the room but it's something even I forget to clean in my own house at times. I did not get to eat there for the restaurant was closed at the times I was in the hotel. The bar has the basic and even had a LIVE piano player. I would stay here again, the staff is friendly and very helpful.",nan,1,ex3384
expedia,"The location was fantastic. The staff was incredible. An the room was very, very clean. The staff was very accommodating, as was the Valet. On the not so positive side: The room was tiny. Very tiny. The heat/cooling fan did not work, or ever turn on. Kind of important in the winter, you would think. There was no exhaust fan in the bathroom (did I mention the room was tiny. Now imagine that mixed with no exhaust fan in the bathroom and a girlfriend who is lactose intolerant). This was my first stay at this hotel, and will be my last. Which is unfortunate, because all the staff was incredible, and the hotel was excellently located.",nan,1,ex3385
expedia,"I came into town for the weekend with my boyfriend to go to the Bulls game on Saturday evening. The Expedia deal was too good to pass up, so I booked at the Knickerbocker hotel. The staff was very accommodating and the room was very nice - kind of small but that was to be expected. We had a drink at the bar on Saturday night and the service was great. We didn't eat at the hotel but the food looked and smelled phenomenal.",nan,1,ex3386

expedia,"We enjoyed the history of the place- up until we were trapped in the elevator. Many people we were with for a wedding had experienced issues with the elevator, then it got stuck and we were in there for about 20 minutes. Otherwise, the rooms were nice but small and the staff was friendly but not always accommodating.",nan,1,ex3390
expedia,Great stay. Affordable rate and really close to everything. The staff was very helpful and easy to access. Rooms were large enough and had very large bathrooms. Overall great hotel option.,nan,1,ex3391
expedia,"Very nice stay, service was great, comfortable bed, wonderful shower and great location. However the room was very small and considering the cost, a complimentary breakfast would have been more appropriate.",nan,1,ex3392
expedia,"Great location. Bathroom facilities need to be updated;in the shower,the hot water was coming after a long while and at a quite low pressure. Poor isolation of the windows which caused a sensitive difference of temperature between the side of the bed close to the window and the other one. The staff was kind.Worthy the money I spent thanks to its location.",nan,1,ex3393
expedia,"We enjoyed our stay. Hotel room was very small and only had a desk chair. Not so good for two of us staying 3 days and having snacks and drinks in our room. Bathroom was great, though, and bed and bedding was terrific!! We love the lobby bar, too. Will stay again.",nan,1,ex3394
expedia,"Great hotel if you can stomach $67.00 each night to park your car. Cleanliness was okay, found several left over pieces of food under our bed and furniture. The rainfall shower was wonderful however.",nan,1,ex3395
expedia,"Beautiful hotel conveniently located near the Michigan street shopping. I had to wait beyond check in time for a room to be available, and when checking out was charged for Internet connection even though it was free with the room. This was quickly corrected on my request. Overall a very nice place to stay.",nan,1,ex3396

expedia,"Hotel staff (front desk, restaurant, bar, etc.) were very helpful and pleasant.",nan,1,ex3398
expedia,"The hotel was very nice and staff was very friendly. I would not book it again for a few reasons that are purely personal preference. The room only had a shower (no tub) and the water pressure in the shower was horrible. It never really felt like I got totally clean while staying at this hotel. The bed was also extremely soft which sounds nice but I woke up with a backache almost every day. The hotel also did not have room service which really disappointed us because we were having a romantic couple's week away and just didn't want to leave the room for breakfast or late night snacks. When we did call to inquire about room service, the staff did run menus up to us immediately for restaurants that deliver, so they were as helpful as they could have been. We had a great stay at the Millennium Knickerbocker but these small details are the reasons we will likely choose a different hotel on our next stay.",nan,1,ex3399
expedia,"The hotel is a bit outdated and historic, but charming. The concierge and staff were incredibly friendly and accommodating. The location is fantastic! My only complaint is the size of the room, it was quite small.",nan,1,ex3400

expedia,Great place to stay for our quick visit to the city. Cannot beat the location and the rooms are nicely updated.,nan,1,ex3402
expedia,"The Millennium Knickerbocker is a great location for downtown Chicago activities! The Water Tower Place is practically right around the corner. We easily walked to the Bean @ Millennium Park and onto the Willis Tower lookout. The hotel itself is clean, quiet, and well appointed for your everyday needs. I'd definitely stay here again.",nan,1,ex3403
expedia,"Had a very nice stay here, but nothing about the hotel would make me rave about it or choose it over something else. Hotel bar was nice.",nan,1,ex3404
expedia,"The hotel is a nice hotel. We had a double queen, roll in shower room. The hotel was clean and the staff was awesome. The only downfall of the room was it took roughly 10 minutes of constant water running for the water to get somewhat warm. We were on the 8th floor. We told the staff the first night about it and the maintenance staff that was on call was to our room within seconds. He said he would reset the water heater and it should work. We just went with it. The day before end of our stay I wrote a statement on there room computers and they worked with us on a couple things.",nan,1,ex3405
expedia,"Girls getaway, so double room, but one robe,refrigerator,which seemed available only for the purpose of overfilling it with their things, in hopes of charging an arm and a leg. No microwave,big inconvenience, not in room or hotel. Called desk for help with screen, never showed up. Room was nice, clean, no view, front desk was a tad bit unprofessional,and, inattentive, I'm from Chicago, so I'm familiar with several hotels, while the decor and location were nice, I wasn't blown away by anything.",nan,1,ex3406

expedia,"Beautiful hotel, great location, friendly, accomodating staff. Would return anytime.",nan,1,ex3408
expedia,"Need to take a cab to all museums, but good location for shopping. Door man on first night was not nice when we went to him to ask a question, telling us, ""I'm not the concierge! Don't you see that sign?"" (the sign saying the concierge was gone for the night.) Rude! All other personnel were nice, especially bartender who referred us to 'The Local' restaurant right around the corner for late night food because their kitchen was closed.",nan,1,ex3409
expedia,"Friendly staff, great location for shopping!",nan,1,ex3410
expedia,"For the Price I thought the room would be a little bit bigger. The room was very noisy, I could hear everything going on in the hallway and the room next to us. Also, once we had turned on the heat to warm the room up it would not turn on again to cool the room down even though we had it set to ""fan"" mode. Hotel was nice and well kept but when you need to sleep at the end of the night it is very hard if your neighbors aren't quiet.",nan,1,ex3411
expedia,"This was a brief stay for my daughter and I to do a little after Christmas shopping. Check-in was a breeze, no line, nice room, a little small but we weren't planning to spend any time other than sleeping in the room. Room was VERY clean. Only complaint was the temp in the room was too warm, temps outside were in the high 50's and we had the thermostat set at 60 but it never cooled down. We tried to open the window but couldn't get it open. Who would think it would be in the 50's at the end of December, right? Only service we used was the bell desk to hold our luggage after we checked out before our flight. EXCELLENT LOCATION!",nan,1,ex3412

expedia,"The Knickerbocker was extremely well located for our purposes (we were in town to see an exhibit at the Museum of Contemporary Art)--close to the museum, the lake, and the hustle and bustle of Michigan Avenue (but far enough away to allow for peace and quiet). The hotel was well appointed, comfortable, and very quiet. Rooms are small, but nicely updated.",nan,1,ex3417

I would stay here again with no second thoughts.",nan,1,ex3430
expedia,"Location is pretty good. Staff overall was friendly. Great drinks at the bar! Problems were, the fan didn't work on the air in the room, the computer didn't work in the room, the shower leaked onto the bathroom floor and the exhaust fan didn't work.

expedia,The hotel staff very nice. Decent location and easy walking distance to many shops on Michigan Ave and the night life on Rush St. My biggest complaint was the shower. In order for us to get hot water we had to let the shower run for nearly 15 minutes the first night and even then the temperature fluctuated during the shower. The second night the water didn't warm up within 15 minutes so I gave up. We were driving home early the next morning so I didn't bother calling the front desk. All in all the room was clean and nice. I'd probably stay here again but I'd have to make a call to get the hot water fixed.,nan,1,ex3442

The hotel is in a great location for all things you need . I would pick this hotel again .",nan,1,ex3443
expedia,We stayed here for my daughter's birthday. The staff went out of their way to make her feel celebrated. We had a wonderful stay. I would definitely stay here again.,nan,1,ex3444
expedia,"Been looking forward to staying here for a long time. The hotel is in a great place, and is great. The room is really nice and the shower was fantastic. The only drawback was the elevator. I was on the 3rd floor so I could use the stairs, but if you are further up, it could be a pain. There were 2 working elevators and 1 not working. They could only hold 6 people, without bags, and they were slow. Used the stairs a lot!",nan,1,ex3445
expedia,The hotel was very close to Water Place mall and Oak St. shopping. Great access to the miracle mile..,nan,1,ex3446
expedia,Had a great time. Close to main shopping areas. Staff at Hotel was great. No surprises with room. Food was great in hotel restaurants.,nan,1,ex3447
expedia,The hotel was great although service was less than average.,nan,1,ex3448
expedia,Wonderful experience. Had special request which they handled perfectly. Lovely room. Good breakfast. Will be back.,nan,1,ex3449
expedia,The front desk staff and Consear were very helpful. Only complaint is of the rooms look directly into other rooms,nan,1,ex3450
expedia,Very nice & great location.would definitely consider next time in downtown Chicago. Staff was excellent.,nan,1,ex3451
expedia,"The first room we got smelled like someone just smoked in it. I called the front desk and they said okay we will move you. They took about 25 minutes so I called back. Shortly after someone came up to move us. The next room was much smaller than we had paid for but it was smoke free so we did not say anything. Later that night we wanted to take a hot shower. Come to find out the hot water was not, well hot. I called the front desk again and asked what the deal was. They said they were having issues with the hot water. I asked them was this a all night thing and the lady said to run the hot water in the shower and sink and in about 10 to 15 minitues we would have hot water. The water did get hot and it took all of 15 mins. For the price I would have thought it would have been a better place to stay.",nan,1,ex3452
expedia,Quick and easy check in. Lovely room. Great location.,nan,1,ex3453
expedia,"I was lucky to get my reservation upgraded to a suite, which was very comfortable and spacious. But I have stayed in the regular rooms previously and they are great as well. The location of this hotel is perfect, just off Michigan Avenue with all the shops. The hotel bar is a great place to stay in the evening (though the piano music was a bit too load). I will definitely recommend this hotel to anyone visiting Chicago.",nan,1,ex3454
expedia,"I travel about 95% of the month for business spending most of my nights at hotels. The overall quality of service and room was very inline to what I was expecting for the Knickerbocker, yet the deal that I received via Hotels.com was truly exceptional. The staff is incredibly courteous and the rooms reflect the staff in a clean sleek and modern way. Also if your looking to unwind and have a drink, the first floor offers a very reasonable bar (for Chicago prices) that's just a short stumble from your room.",nan,1,ex3455
expedia,"This hotel is on Michigan Avenue one block from the Chicago River - fantastic location. Walking distance to shops, restaurants, river tours, Navy Pier, etc. The hotel was clean and the staff was very pleasant. The only (minor) issue I had is that one of their upgraded rooms (on the 39th floor) appears to be a converted utility space, for which they charge a premium price. We were unhappy with the lighting (unlighted hallway that separates the room from the bathroom), layout (a utility door to the emergency stairwell is right next to the bed), and view (you look over a barrier on the roof to see the view). The staff gave us a new room right away when we told them we weren't happy. Other than that, and the fact that you have to pay for internet connectivity, I was happy with our stay.",nan,1,ex3456
expedia,"Great location and very friendly staff! The particular room was one of the tiniest I've ever seen, but functional.",nan,1,ex3457
expedia,Rooms were very clean but a little small. The staff is friendly. It is very well located on the magnificent mile!,nan,1,ex3458
expedia,"Great place, should tell you ahead of time that there is a $67 per night parking fee",nan,1,ex3459
expedia,Fantastic place to stay and great location. Highly recommend it.,nan,1,ex3460
expedia,"The room itself was fine. There was a lot of functional comfort, and nice touches like the charging station on the alarm clock, but there were some holes too. I called a week before and asked for extra pillows. I made the same request during check-in and over the course of 4 days never got them. Speaking of check-in, the 375$ 'incidentals hold' would have been nice to receive advance warning of. No one likes to have a surprise 400$ chunk taken or held out of their account. Also the coffee maker was a sad experience. A real coffee maker is a one time investment. If people can have them in an office, surely a hotel room can manage one.",nan,1,ex3461
expedia,"Great hotel on Michigan Ave just north of the River. Close to Apple Store, Bandera's Restaurant, Andy's Jazz Club , Shaw's Crab House and Joe's Steakhouse. Michael Jordan's Steakhouse off the Lobby. Plenty of cheaper eateries just west of Michigan Avenue. Has great Art Deco pool. My only negative was the weird carpet which is supposed to have a weathered look which was really successful. I thought it was just on my floor and that they must be renovating but it is the carpet theme throughout. Talked to some of the staff and was told this was a conscious choice of decor.",nan,1,ex3462
expedia,Old hotel room too small. Staffs are not friendly.,nan,1,ex3463
expedia,"The rooms were nice - pillows were great! The lobby was very busy and there weren't enough people at the desk to accommodate the line of customers. That was a bit frustrating. However, the staff was friendly.",nan,1,ex3464
expedia,"I really enjoyed my stay. The room was excellent and the staff was exemplary - from the front desk to the bell captain to the concierge, they all made my stay better with their service!",nan,1,ex3465
expedia,"Went for a night out with my daughters who are 4 & 9. The min depth of the pool is 4 ft. and goes to 10 ft. My 9 year old is a great swimmer, and she was not happy in the pool. she complains that the sides Phelps fly me to if she tried to hold on. the room was pretty small and cramped which I know is pretty usual for the area. However we noticed a ton of dust all over the fixtures along the ceiling. We weren't looking for it but it kind of grossed us out none the less. The location is fabulous! Close walking distance to everything.",nan,1,ex3466
expedia,Newly remodeled rooms are beautiful. Proximity to navy pier and lakefront is perfect.,nan,1,ex3467
expedia,"Great location, on the magnificent mile, near rush street and Navy pier. comfortable beds, even the coffee maker and glasses were spotless, most beautiful pool in Chicago. Room was a little small but doable, parking was $67 a day ouch",nan,1,ex3468
expedia,Some elevator issues. Took a while to get up and down the modern tower.,nan,1,ex3469
expedia,"We had a great time at the hotel, definitely memorable way to spend our 25th wedding anniversary!",nan,1,ex3470
expedia,"hotel was nice and close to a lot of attractions we wanted to see. Also very accessible to the red line needed to get to Wrigley field. Only down side was we reserved a double bed room and when we checked in they really didn't care much that they were over booked. To make it right they did send a roll away bed to the room but we were told that they were out of pillows, go figure. The next day we had a great lady name Shayla who was really apologetic and got us into the proper room and really took care of us. I would go back based on the experience with Shayla and because of the location of the hotel.",nan,1,ex3471
expedia,"The hotel was great, very clean, great staff and the room was in mint condition. Located in the heart of Chicago Downtown it was very easy to walk to many restaurants and shops. The only thing that I noticed was odd, was the loudness of the room heater. It was considerably louder than most HVAC systems that I have seen, making sleep a bit tougher than usual.",nan,1,ex3472
expedia,"Hotel in a great location. Starbucks within the hotel! Bob at the Concierges Desk (probably the most important position in the hotel for guests) was wonderful. He was so helpful and has a great personality. My sister-in-law also stayed at this hotel last Spring Break a year ago, and she told me that Bob was so nice and very helpful to her too. The Bellman who looks like a Jamie Fox was so nice and charming; and, wow, he is handsome!! The only drawback to the room was the fan on the air conditioner was always on unless you turned the whole unit off, and it blew directly on you in bed.",nan,1,ex3473
expedia,The Hotel concierge was not friendly but overall the stay was nice.,nan,1,ex3474
expedia,"The overall cleanliness of the hotel was managed well. I was disappointed in four primary areas; there was a $12 charge, plus tax, to use the fitness center, we were in long lines to get access to a room to be told a room was not available and had to stay in the long line again to retrieve a key, check-in staff did not treat everyone in our large party (10) very well, and there was not an adequate level of seating in the lobby area for guests. I've stayed at other hotels on Michigan Ave, have paid less, and received better levels of service. I was expecting more.",nan,1,ex3475
expedia,"Room a bit barren. Bed, TV, empty space. Is this enough info, thanks.",nan,1,ex3476
expedia,"Fine accommodations. Great location. Room was fairly large but sparsely furnished. It looked as though they'd removed a lounge chair and that left a big empty space. Bathroom was average and had absolutely no counter space. Lighting was bad in the bathroom as well. I can't rave or complain about anything; the lobby is small but nice, front desk and bell staff was friendly, rooms were fine. I will say the elevators ran smoothly and the hotel was packed--that's a plus. And, it was quiet. I'd stay here again if the price was right but I wouldn't pay a premium for this hotel. You expect a certain level of service and accommodation at an InterContinental hotel and we're not sure this met expectations, if we'd paid a higher rate we'd be very disappointed.",nan,1,ex3477
expedia,Had a great time at the hotel. Friendly staff; top-notch service; beautiful pool that stays open late.,nan,1,ex3478
expedia,"We've stayed here many times, and love the hotel and location.",nan,1,ex3479
expedia,"Booked this as an unpublished rate/hotel. Asked for a late check in and a king bed. Was given an absolutely huge corner room in the renovated tower on the 31st floor. Spectacular view. Incredibly comfortable bed. I tend to dislike sleeping in hotels and have issues with insomnia, but I fell asleep in a heartbeat. Huge sparkling clean bathroom with a separate tub. We were only staying a night but I didn't want to leave.",nan,1,ex3480
expedia,Would stay again in a heartbeat. Right on mag mile. Starbucks on site a plus.,nan,1,ex3481
expedia,"The room was a bit smaller than I would have predicted or liked. The pool and fitness center were very nice. The hotel staff was very accommodating, however I would not stay here again not would I recommend this hotel to a friend.",nan,1,ex3482
expedia,The entire staff tried to make a guests stay pleasurable. What a nice experience,nan,1,ex3483
expedia,my daughter and Zi were there for a Stylemax Trade Show and it was in an excellent location.,nan,1,ex3484
expedia,they renew the rooms in a top floors which they so nice,nan,1,ex3485
expedia,"We enjoyed our stay and the hotel is excellently sited on Michigan Ave. but it is irritating to be charged for internet access, $15.00/day, and health club access, $12.00/day, at a time when the lowly Motel 6 offers these amenities for free.",nan,1,ex3486
expedia,"I have always been aware that parking is $67 a night, but thought that the Expedia deal included parking, just assumed, was very disappointed to find out when I checked out that I owed for 2 nights parking, wondering how much I really saved by using Expedia?",nan,1,ex3487
expedia,"Very pleasant and courteous stay. Short walk to all business centers, very easy access to cabs as hop on, hop off. They Magnificient Mile is kept very clean and most important very safe. I would defitly go back and this time enjoy as a tourist.",nan,1,ex3488
expedia,"Everything was great! Staff was very nice, helpful and accommodating. Very convenient location to everything in downtown Chicago. Comfy room and don't miss the junior olympic pool and workout facility which is amazing!",nan,1,ex3489
expedia,"I was unimpressed by the room size, very small quarters. The beds were doubles and the bathroom was small as well. The water pressure in the shower was not very strong. The parking price was EXTREMELY overpriced. My best experience was the man in the bell hop at the front of the hotel. He was very kind and generous with his assistance even though he was busy!",nan,1,ex3490
expedia,"I would not recommend this hotel. They charge you for everything. I had to have them lock the mini bar because they said if we move anything they would charge us the full price of the item that was moved. The hotel only allows 3 people to a room (this is not stated on their website). They also charge you for any local calls that you make. They gym is not available to everyone. If you want to use the gym they charge you $12.00 a day. The staff was not friendly. They make you feel like you are not worth their time and that they are better than you. It was unbelieveable. While talking to the staff at registration they kept saying that their hotel is not the same as other hotels, aren't all hotels different?? It was like they were doing us a favour.",nan,1,ex3491
expedia,I reserved three months ago...... Standard Room $210 Rate (with Breakfast) Room was too standard........ The adress is really good for all our schedule. Consierge really good...... (he help us many times) Food was good ++ the hotel facilities are oldies (in the limit) I think they capture our loyalty if they offer an upgrade considering they have lower rates when we check in on march.,nan,1,ex3492
expedia,Very unhelpful staff. Reservation problems. Greed.,nan,1,ex3493
expedia,Very nice hotel. Great location near all the stores.,nan,1,ex3494
expedia,Rooms were small. We had a room with two double beds with 3 people and we were on top of each other all the time. The staff was great. I think paying for internet service in a hotel of this stature is ridiculous.,nan,1,ex3495
expedia,"Compared to other hotels we tried, this room was nicest. Awesome pool. Beware in-room snacks / mini bar calling out for you at outrageous prices.",nan,1,ex3496
expedia,"all in all, nice place to stay. but, our room's hvac was extremely noisy- to the point we had to turn it off to sleep. room was a bit cramped, especially at entrance but view was good and location is excellent. would stay again",nan,1,ex3497
expedia,"Intercontinental is located on a great spot, not far from the train station and directly on The Mile. The hotel overall was very clean and well kept but not kid friendly in any way. It is also old fashioned in the fact that internet is not included and almost everything is an up charge. We actually received a charge for a drink in the refrigerator after it was tipped over which generated an automated charge. The pool was nice, but separated for lap swimming and not a good shallow end for kids. I would probably not stay here again since I travel for business (do not want to pay for internet) or I travel with family (zero kid benefits).",nan,1,ex3498
expedia,"The location is great but the amenities are not too updated. Besides, you have to pay for the wifi.",nan,1,ex3499
expedia,"Beautiful hotel, great staff and perfect location on michigan avenue",nan,1,ex3500
expedia,Fantastic stay! Cab service so convenient. Loved the Magnificent Mile!,nan,1,ex3501
expedia,"Superb location. Great quality hotel. Amazing value when you consider you have the best of Chicago on your doorstep. Stores including Nordstrom, a shopping mall and lots of lovely shops directly opposite. Macys, Bloomingdales, Apple, Nike and another huge mall just down the street. Bit of a squeeze for 4 people in the room with 2 double beds, but it's workable. Breakfast is good (buffet style, lots of options) and is better value to pre-pay than to pay when you're there unless you won't have the breakfast every day. Starbucks in the lobby is open from 6am every day. Beware the usual vastly inflated hotel prices for water, snacks etc from the minibar. Get your supplies from the Walgreens across the street in the Wrigley Building and you'll save a fortune. Pool is superb although some of the guests (understandably) don't appreciate young children having a loud splash-about so it's a good idea to choose your times carefully to avoid the very early mornings or evenings when business people are more likely to be using the facilities. The changing rooms are well equipped and the showers are good (better than shower in room). Didn't use the fitness equipment but there's plenty to choose from. Free wifi if you join the hotel's loyalty scheme while you're there (or if you're already a member of IHG). Bus stop right outside which will take you to all the (amazing) museums. Excellent staff and altogether an extremely pleasant stay. Will be staying here again.",nan,1,ex3502
expedia,"Great location. Bed comfortable. Bath products nice. Nice staff. Room 960. Window drafty. In this day and age, charging for WiFi is just cheesy. Even 2-3 star properties give free Wifi.",nan,1,ex3503
expedia,"Three days in Chicago for sghtseeing, museums, shops and restaurants",nan,1,ex3504
expedia,Enjoyed a Romantic Valentines Day weekend at the hotel. Hotel was centrally located and had great amenities.,nan,1,ex3505
expedia,"We had the King Deluxe in the old tower for a Valentine's Day getaway. Nice enough room, but nothing special for a hotel with such a high rating. Mini fridge was warm, very slow elevators, no sitting furniture other than the bed, no hairdryer until we called, ice located three floors down and was shut off, and the parking is VERY expensive. Most of the staff was very professional, but one was relatively rude when we told him about the fridge. I will definitely pick different similarly rated hotel in the future.",nan,1,ex3506
expedia,Location was very convenient to shopping and dining.,nan,1,ex3507
expedia,The room was very clean and had everything that we needed. The view was marvelous! I could see Michigan Avenue just outside my window. The staff was friendly and helpful. You can't beat the location! I highly recommend it if you need a weekend getaway or if you are staying there on business. I've stayed at hundreds of hotels and this ranks as one of the best!,nan,1,ex3508
expedia,Hotel was lovely; staff was snooty. Just because one has money doesn't mean one is entitled or is a snob. It was difficult to tell who was more distasteful; the clientele or the staff. I'll take my money elsewhere thankyouverymuch.,nan,1,ex3509
expedia,The room was clean but it was a little small. Location is perfect and located near all the wonderful shopping on Michigan Avenue. The hotel robs were very thin and cheap. I would stay at this hotel again.,nan,1,ex3510
expedia,Got asked on my room preference but wasn't always available. 3 out of 3 stays will be enough for me.,nan,1,ex3511
expedia,"It was an ok hotel, but I wouldn't stay again. While it might seem strange, the carpet in the hallways was AWFUL, it looked like a huge mistake, The green and the brown, just horrible. Also, the room was small and the bathroom was dated. And finally, my main complaint is overnight parking was a whopping $67 per night. I thought Vegas was bad at $25.00 per night, but $67 per night is just asinine",nan,1,ex3512
expedia,"it cost 67 for a overnight parking and 39 for 2 and a half hour... If you have a car, never park here!",nan,1,ex3513
expedia,The suites are worth the upgrade. Pretty views of Michigan ave,nan,1,ex3514
expedia,I HAD A HORIBLE EXPERIENCE WITH THIS HOTEL NEVER AGAIN WILL I STAY HERE! I'M STILL WAITING FOR MY REFUND THAT WAS PROMISED,nan,1,ex3515

expedia,Great stay. Excellent location. Professional staff,nan,1,ex3517
expedia,"For example, the front staff was very friendly enough to find out my membership number since I didn't bring it with me.",nan,1,ex3518
expedia,"overall disappointing, the rooms are old and dated, and the hotel staff was not adequately responsive this is far from a 4-star hotel",nan,1,ex3519
expedia,"We checked into our room and it was much smaller than anticipated. It was also dirty. There were stains all over the lampshade and on the windowsill. I called to switch rooms and ask for an upgrade. They were will to change rooms but they weren't willing to give us a discount on an upgrade. We ended up paying for a larger, nicer room, and only after asking them multiple times did they give me $25 off the room. Also, the woman at the front desk forgot to send s cot up to our room. I was surprised at the low quality of the room as this hotel was once one of the better on the mag mile. We stayed away from the newer boutique hotels bc we thought the rooms at IC would be much bigger. We thought wrong. We also had to pay $12 just to use the workout equipment.",nan,1,ex3520
expedia,"Not bad for the price and location. Awesome neighborhood, parking costs were insane. And DON'T even TOUCH the pistachios because they'll charge you for just picking them up!",nan,1,ex3521
expedia,Always an amazing place to stay in Chicago.,nan,1,ex3522
expedia,"Average to below average for this hotel, I dont know the hype about this hotel, nothing spectacular other than it is located in michigan ave heart of the magnificent mile, room is too cramp and be careful looking in your frig, it is rig if one of the drinks is misplace you are going to be charge.",nan,1,ex3523
expedia,Rooms very small,nan,1,ex3524
expedia,We stayed in a two bedroom which was small in size. Very nice indoor pool & workout facility. It is convenient that Starbucks is located next to lobby area. We also had many restaurants at walking distance from hotel.,nan,1,ex3525
expedia,We asked for an accessible room for various space needs and what we received was a disappointment. Housekeeping stopped on day two when we were there and never came back. The room looked as if it hadn't been updated in a while. I could be wrong on this but that's the way it appeared to us. The one bright spot was the location. It was good.,nan,1,ex3526
expedia,"Great hotel in a great location. Very nice rooms, shower, and restaurant. Parking was the most expensive I have ever seen even when compared to Tokyo, London, or NYC.",nan,1,ex3527
expedia,"The hotel its situated in a very convenient location, quick five minute walk to Millenium Park and all of its attractions. The service is pretty good, no complains for that aspect at all. I must say that valet parking its a bit pricey, and there is no park your self. You can still park In the street at your own risk, and then walk to the hotel. The breakfast was included with our room and it was good.",nan,1,ex3528
expedia,"I booked a 2 night getaway at this hotel for my kids and myself, mainly because of location and that it has a pool.The hotel staff was very courteous upon checking in. Once inside the average sized room I noticed there wasn't enough towels and the the window shade was broken. I called the front desk and alerted them to these two things. The receptionist told me she was going to let housekeeping know we needed more towels and let maintenance know about the window shade. Housekeeping came within the next few minutes with more towels but maintenance never came, neither day. It was a little disappointing because we had a good view of Michigan Ave and I like natural light. The pool was bigger than expected but I didn't like there wasnt enough room for open swim or playing. The six lanes were set up for laps. Maybe a few lane markers could be taken out so kids can have room to play and really enjoy the pool. The location of the hotel is perfect. You will be in the thick of it all. Steps away from mass shopping and restaurants. All in all we enjoyed our little getaway from the norm.",nan,1,ex3529
expedia,The hotel staff was very accommodating for our needs and requests. The room was clean and comfortable.,nan,1,ex3530

expedia,We thoroughly enjoyed our stay--it was a return visit.,nan,1,ex3544
expedia,"Attended a family wedding and stayed the weekend. While everything about the hotel is great, at peak times, they were obviously understaffed, and the elevators need a waiting area. Both are extremely slow at the worst times.",nan,1,ex3545

expedia,"Overall we liked the room, the location and the service was really great. The only thing that bummed me out was the pool area- the pool only had swimming lanes built in, so it wasn't set up for a free-swim situation, and there was no hot tub- something I think they need there. Otherwise, a nice place.",nan,1,ex3547

expedia,Great hotel in a fantastic location!,nan,1,ex3550
expedia,Everything was great but the air conditioning unit was so noisy we had to turn the heat off even though it was the coldest time of the year. Bathtub was so annoying to adjust temperature I am actually writing about it. Everything else about the hotel was superb. Complimentary Starbucks vouchers for 2 free drinks at the Starbucks located in the lobby. The bar was more than accommodating for the 4 wine glasses we needed.,nan,1,ex3551

Definitely noticed some wear and tear in the bathroom area, could be better.....

The Historic part of the hotel is beautiful, almost Castle like, very nice....",nan,1,ex3553
expedia,"I really enjoyed my stay. The hotel was in a great location, and the staff was extremely friendly and helpful.",nan,1,ex3554
expedia,"Hotel is fine. We were only there for sleeping. Staff is friendly. Hotel is immaculate. Only complaint is size of elevators and wait to get one. There were lines to get on one of the four elevators almost constantly and they only held 6-8 people and if there was a bellhop with a luggage cart, only 2 or 3 could fit. A minor inconvenience, but and inconvenience nonetheless. No complaints otherwise. Checkin was fast and easy and very friendly staff.",nan,1,ex3555
expedia,"We were celebrating our anniversary! We had a king suite overlooking Michigan ave. The room was absolutely beautiful! Very clean! I'm very paticular and was very happy! My only complaint...and its a big one, is that the bedding (the blanket)looked and felt like a mattress pad.The one that's between the sheets I found that to be really gross for such a high end hotel!",nan,1,ex3556
expedia,Did not like the service at front desk,nan,1,ex3557

expedia,"Just a night out away from the kids. Great location for restaurants and things to do. Some of the fixtures in the room were in need of replacing (hook in the bathroom, tub faucet) but nothing that would make our stay less enjoyable. Very quiet despite loud location, comfortable, clean, and nice and friendly staff.",nan,1,ex3559
expedia,The room was perfect for our New Years stay in Chicago. Fitness area and pool were great. We would definitely stay here again. Only downside was the $65 per day parking fee.,nan,1,ex3560
expedia,The experience was great. We were there with our extended family which included 2 adults and 2 children. The children loved the pool. They love to swim. The location of the hotel was excellent for us to walk on Michigan Avenue to the Watertower and several restaurants. All employees were friendly and were very helpful.,nan,1,ex3561
expedia,We stayed in an updated room. The rooms are not spacious but fine for a family of 4 staying one night. Beds were very comfortable. There was usually a line for the elevator but it was a very busy time over holiday break. Pool was great for the kids. Loved the location of hotel.,nan,1,ex3562
expedia,"Simply stated, the hotel is unable to host the amount of rooms available. There were times where we literally waited for elevators between 10-20 minutes, because they were so slow or due to over crowding. also, for some unknown reason, we were charged to use their fitness area? How the hell is that possible as it is already a sunk cost??",nan,1,ex3563
expedia,"I came, I stayed. The guy who checked us in was nice (Elijah?). Other than that, the hotel staff pretty much was not seen or present.",nan,1,ex3564
expedia,"At check in, the first room smelled damp, so when requesting another room it was not ready till 9:00 that night. I would say the location was great. In this hotel be aware that you have to pay to workout.",nan,1,ex3565
expedia,"Great location, very nice hotel. We'd stay again.",nan,1,ex3566
expedia,Bathroom amenities at a minimal. They could offer a cotton ball or q tip. Asked for extra robes. Waited 20 min called again housekeeping said never got call too another 10 minutes,nan,1,ex3567
expedia,"Everything was great. We went for NYE! It's located near all of my favorite shoppes and restaurants. I hated that the room didn't have a fridge or a microwave, other than that I'd stay here again.",nan,1,ex3568
expedia,Very clean room and helpful staff. Convenient location right on the Magnifcent Mile.,nan,1,ex3569
expedia,"The elevators took forever, front desk staff rude, valet slow, overall rundown and appeared worn, elevators confusing being unable to get some floors from certain elevators due to renovations at hotel with poor signage and no way finding instructions given. Great location on Michigan ave but that was it.",nan,1,ex3570
expedia,All great,nan,1,ex3571
expedia,"The hotel is in a great location. You walk out and your on Michigan Avenue. We were lucky enough to get a view of Michigan Avenue from our hotel room. The only compliant about the room that I have is that the bathroom did not have an exhaust fan. It was extremely hot to the point where we turned of the heat in the room becuase we were sweating while we were getting ready. The pool is nice water is heated and is very clean. The only other problem was the check in/check out, the line was extremely long and there were only two attendants working to assist customers. All in all the hotel was very clean and would stay here again.",nan,1,ex3572
expedia,Was very surprised at the size of the room. It was very spacious and an overall great experience!,nan,1,ex3573
expedia,Perfect location for Magnificent Mile. Great price for the luxury. Only negative was poor wifi quality.,nan,1,ex3574
expedia,This was a one night getaway for our 30th wedding anniversary and this hotel was perfect. The room was very clean and comfortable. The location on Michigan Avenue is excellent. Service was prompt and friendly. The room was very clean and well appointed. It was fairly small but plenty of room for two. The bathroom was very clean and updated. Good partial view of Lake Michigan from the 31st floor. The room was very quiet even though it was right next to the elevator. There were only 7 guest rooms on our floor so there wasn't much traffic. We paid extra so breakfast was included. It was excellent. Food was delicious with a good variety and impeccable service from the staff. We highly recommend this hotel.,nan,1,ex3575
expedia,Very busy at check in and out. Staff seemed a tad overwhelmed and construction was going on in the building which could have factored into things. Thought the pool could have stayed open a bit longer thatn 10.,nan,1,ex3576
expedia,Find him a comfortable bed and a quiet room and smelled wonderful and his breakfast is excellent and wonderful price to book from expedia and deserves five stars .,nan,1,ex3577
expedia,Good hotel.... Great location On Michigan Ave ..... Makes sure you eat at geno's pizza .... Read details mini bar if item is move you are charged ..... Parking is $65 but great service and car out of the weather. . Resonabe nightly hotel rates.,nan,1,ex3578
expedia,The staff never asked us if we needed anything. I'm talking about 6 rooms and 21 people.,nan,1,ex3579
expedia,"Great location - close to shopping on magnificent mile, ice skating at millennium park and not to far from a couple of L stops of you want to venture out to other Chicago neighborhoods. Bed was very comfortable!",nan,1,ex3580
expedia,"$65 parking, remember .",nan,1,ex3581
expedia,My daughter and I really enjoyed the history behind this hotel. There is a free recorded walking tour you can take to learn about the history. There has been lots of great restoration done to this hotel.,nan,1,ex3582
expedia,It was bit on the small side but perfect for our needs. We were pleasantly surprised that the breakfast that was included was one of the best we ever had. The bed was very comfortable and the pool was amazing with full of historical beauty and elegance.,nan,1,ex3583
expedia,Terrible hotel and staff is rude! They charge more for less!! The concierge service is awfull and disristpectfull will never use intercontinental in chicago agai,nan,1,ex3584
expedia,It was my 25th wedding anniversary and we had to wait 1 1/2 hrs for our luggage I finally went down and got it myself. There was a line at the elevators all the time even though there was 4 of them. I have stayed on Michigan Ave at least 12 times on different hotels and I won't go back to this one. Just wish I didn't have to figure that out on my anniversary.,nan,1,ex3585
expedia,Got super faded and met zeds dead. Hotel wasn't bad coulda been bigger,nan,1,ex3586
expedia,Excelente,nan,1,ex3587
expedia,"Excellent location, great hotel. Check-in team leaves allot to be desired. It took us 4 hours to get a room, and took 3 attempts. Each time we were told to simply wait, and a bellman would get our bags and move us to a new room. No one showed. I've stayed here sevenl times, but this was the worst. We feel one of our three days was wasted.",nan,1,ex3588
expedia,The lobby is unimpressive. Room was well-equipped. Location great.,nan,1,ex3589
expedia,You can't beat the location for downtown. The hotel is old but has charm and was well maintained.,nan,1,ex3590
expedia,"this is a great location for shopping, the parks and many dinner options. great combination of an older formal setting with updated beds and bathrooms and a very friendly staff. the pool is awesome!",nan,1,ex3591
expedia,"We have just returned from a 5 night stay. Location is amazing, perfect for shopping, close to great restaurants. Hotel was clean, rooms were a little small for 4 of us, but no big deal. Food in bar was great, waiting staff were attentive and friendly. Bar staff not so friendly, especially one gentlemen. Shame! Reception staff great, friendly and helpful. Thank you for an amazing stay. We have made some fantastic memories.",nan,1,ex3592
expedia,"We stayed here for New Years. Great location and luxury at an affordable price. My only negative is that this place is busy! We needed to wait in line for the elevators, service, and coffee shop.",nan,1,ex3593
expedia,I had my 8 y/o grandson with me and everyone made sure he had a good time! Very helpful! I stayed there with my son 20 years ago and also for a conference. Always a great experience!,nan,1,ex3594
expedia,"Wonderful location, hotel staff was absolutely amazing and helpful. Would stay again for sure",nan,1,ex3595
expedia,"Check-in was quick. Receptionist explained services offered and room was ready early which allowed us to relax for a few minutes before sightseeing. Room was very clean, comfortable and quiet.",nan,1,ex3596
expedia,Loved it.Very nice experience.I would love to come back.,nan,1,ex3597
expedia,Was great,nan,1,ex3598
expedia,"Very nice in many ways, but especially appreciated the friendly and smiling staff!",nan,1,ex3599
expedia,Had a great time! Kids went swimming pool is enormous that was a plus. Hotel is near everything great food restaurants mag mile shopping.,nan,1,ex3600
expedia,The room got warm so we put the air conditioning on but it was loud and never shut off. Staff very helpful.,nan,1,ex3601
expedia,Shower had mold. Elevators took excessive time to get and move in. Charged me for checkout. Terrible time . Was here 2 years ago and it has taken 10 steps backward,nan,1,ex3602
expedia,Got a room on expedia for $103 after-tax for a Monday night before Christmas. Great overnight vacation while back in the Chicago suburbs.,nan,1,ex3603
expedia,"When you get a good price on this, grab it. Spacious suite, huge buffet breakfast pool jacuzzi, very clean, and for a family of four...great deal",nan,1,ex3604
expedia,"It was exactly what I had hoped for, the comfort of home. Everyone I dealt with were personal, friendly, and helpful. I would recommend this hotel to anyone who inquires. I look forward to visiting Intercontinental Chicago, my son lives in Chicago and I will be back. Thank you for a wonderful experience.",nan,1,ex3605
expedia,Long lines at check in. Staff was not friend or helpful,nan,1,ex3606
expedia,"Fantastic location. Front desk helpful. Great pool to swim in, we enjoyed it.",nan,1,ex3607
expedia,Night downtown with the kids to enjoy the pool and see the lights. Service was friendly and very responsive. Super comfy bed!,nan,1,ex3608
expedia,I requested a handicap assessible bathroom at the time of booking the room. There were hand rails near the bath tub but the toilet was too low and made it difficult for us to use. The room itself was nice but smaller than it appeared in the pictures seen on line.,nan,1,ex3609
expedia,great location for shops in Michigan and restaurants. Park the car and walk everywhere from here.,nan,1,ex3610
expedia,The location is great. Hotel room with double beds was not ready even an hour after checkin time. There was a wedding there and the music on our floor felt like we were at wedding - music finally stopped at around 11 pm. We were on the 9th floor. The indoor pool was warm and filled with lots of kids. They was someone on staff but the pool area was left messy with no housekeeping cleaning the area neat.,nan,1,ex3611
expedia,"We arrived around 4:00PM and the the valet outside was quick and took our car right away. The check-in process was long and arduous. The line of people that was out the door, and six or seven reservation agents were either busy with their head buried in the computer or vying with the manager to go on break. While waiting in-line, I went to find an ATM which required the assistance of three different people to find. Tough to tip your bell boys if you can't find an ATM. Eventually we were checked-in and then headed up to the room that we had reserved. We got a great rate through hotels.com - but overall the stay was poor. We ordered room service for dinner whose food quality was just beyond passable, yet unacceptable at a price of $59 for spaghetti and water!) The next morning we ordered pancakes and a belgain waffle which was so poor that we returned the pancakes. On check-out we were hit with unexpected charges. The room-service group said that they were going to remove the charge for the pancakes, but they did not, and then I saw a charge on my account for $65 for the overnight parking! All-in-all, a pretty disappointing experience at the Intercontinental. If I had paid full price for this room, I would have lost it.",nan,1,ex3612
expedia,"Called ahead for early check-in, gave arrival time and they confirmed. Upon arrival, we waited in line 30 people deep, 20 minutes, to check-in. Room wasn't ready. We were advised via text that a room was ready twenty minutes after hotel check-in time. Stood in another line for 15 mins. Realized as I left desk that I had received only two room keys instead of the four keys I had just requested. Concierge wouldn't help me. I stood in line again for 15 minutes. No acknowledgement of error from desk clerk, or sincere apology for inconvenience. Room for four was narrow and small. Three bath towels, no wash clothes and no hand towels. Called for housekeeping to bring ASAP. However, 45 mins later, made a second call requesting the same, and 15 mins later towels arrived. Brunch was wonderful, although billing was incorrect and had to fix that. Bellmen was great, wait staff/hostess at brunch was great. But....Management was no where to be seen with the above errors, long lines, chaos. I couldn't recommend this hotel because the hassle-factors were too high.",nan,1,ex3613
expedia,"Excellent location for shopping and sight seeing. Excellent and knowledgeable staff. The only complaint would be the wait for elevators, however this was occasional and could be excused since it only became an issue during the 2days prior to Christmas eve (high occupancy) Would choose again",nan,1,ex3614
expedia,"Service was abysmal, updated rooms were small and construction quality was poor. Older rooms were comfortable but in need of an update and the windows were filthy, blocking our somewhat decent view of downtown Chicago.",nan,1,ex3615
expedia,We had a 2-hour delay getting into our room at 5:30 pm check-in. We didn't get into our room until 7:30 pm. We had to wait in line again for 30 minutes just to get our keys at 7:30 pm.,nan,1,ex3616
expedia,Room had a view of the alley. It took the front desk a long time to check us in. A bit overpriced.,nan,1,ex3617
expedia,STAY WAS OK. Room was not ready at check in time and there were many guests waiting for a room and had to wait to check in. This was difficult for those of us with reservations for dinner!,nan,1,ex3618
expedia,"Great staff, very accomodating.. Great location..",nan,1,ex3619
expedia,Good stay!,nan,1,ex3620

expedia,Very interesting historic hotel with great reconstruction to detail.,nan,1,ex3622
expedia,"Excellent hotel. Had a very romantic stay with the gf here. Awesome pool, friendly staff, accommodating valet service, and a great location for doing downtown Chicago.",nan,1,ex3623
expedia,InterContinental Chicago Magnificent Mile.. Michael Jordon restaurant was very nice too. food was fantastic... Late check out..,nan,1,ex3624
expedia,"We stayed here during the holidays and chose this hotel mostly because of the great rate we got. We were able to get 3 rooms, enabling us to spread out and be comfortable. Great location, comfortable rooms and beds, clean with good service.",nan,1,ex3625
expedia,"We enjoyed the Intercontinental very much. Every year we spend the weekend before Christmas in Chicago, and every year we choose a different downtown hotel. We've always been lucky & this year is no exception: great price, great service, great atmosphere, great location! Thank you Intercontinental for a wonderful stay! PS - the old pool is amazing!",nan,1,ex3626
expedia,"Visited Chicago to look at wedding dresses with our daughter. Hotel location was perfect, Michigan Avenue a block from the Tribune building. Stayed in the historic tower which was charming. Fitness center with 1930's pool was very nice. Very comfortable, would stay again without reservation. Only shocker was the $65 a night parking. Management was very responsive to the one little problem we had getting a bag to the room from the valet.",nan,1,ex3627
expedia,"Stayed at the Intercontinental for one night during Christmas week. Would give it 3.5/5. Location was great, staff extremely polite. Room was adequate, though could use a little work. Wallpaper was peeling off at the seams. Tube-shaped pillows not the most comfortable. Was very warm, had to blow cold air most of the night (Chicago in December?) to balance room temp. For one night in the city though it was a decent stay for the money. Starbucks entrance from lobby was a big plus in the morning. One note, I pre-booked overnight parking down the street from an online site and saved $37. The hotel valet is $67, pretty steep...",nan,1,ex3628
expedia,"We had a great family get away for the weekend at Christmas time. The location couldn't be more perfect, right in the middle of Michigan Avenue attractions/shopping. We used the pool and room service for late night chocolate chip cookies in bed, a huge hit with our 3 and 5 year olds! The check in desk staff couldn't have been more efficient or accommodating during a very busy holiday weekend. Overall a great weekend getaway!",nan,1,ex3629
expedia,Great location but small rooms and housekeeping staff weren't welcoming. The checkin staff were very personable and friendly! Gorgeous pool but a little hard to get into for small kids and the elderly!,nan,1,ex3630
expedia,"Keys to the room had be remade 3 times. Lack of elevator capacity and also often long lines in the reception area. Rooms ok, but not great.",nan,1,ex3631
expedia,Check in was delayed 2 hours. Room was mediocre. You can find better for similar price in area. Over 20 min wait for bell stand and valet pickup. Don't stay here,nan,1,ex3632
expedia,"Very spacious room,very clean. Busy location but very helpful staff",nan,1,ex3633
expedia,"Great room and lobby. I upgraded to a room with a view of Michigan Ave which didn't happen. Nonetheless, it was a great price.",nan,1,ex3634
expedia,they did not have two doubles as requested given a queen with a roll away very tight could not get in bathroom. gave us 1 morning of breakfast but did not makeup for room.,nan,1,ex3635
expedia,"Not so friendly staff, but good location.",nan,1,ex3636
expedia,The hotel was wonderful and the room was great. Very happy with my stay and would highly recommend,nan,1,ex3637
expedia,The swimming pool and entrance to the hotel is elegant.,nan,1,ex3638
expedia,"As other reviewers have noted, room is rather small. Staff friendly and efficient. The incidental charges are outrageous. My cellphone temporarily had a problem and I used the hotel phone for a long distance call to Miami of no more than 5 minutes. Was charged $30.00 for the call. Charges for wifi start at $15.00/day. Although I did not have a car, the posted rate for parking was $65.00/day.",nan,1,ex3639
expedia,"Great location on Michigan Ave, service was impeccable, amenities were great. Only complaints are no lower-priced eating options in hotel (even in the bar) and no microwave in room.",nan,1,ex3640
expedia,We were supposed to have two beds but when we checked in they said they only has king size bed - and one rol away. Luckly - we were able to secure a second roll away = but it a rely fit in the room. Hotel was in a good location - but if you are used to staying in 4 or 5 star hotels you might be disappointed.,nan,1,ex3641
expedia,Excellent location and great hotel,nan,1,ex3642
expedia,"Wew arrived in the early morning hours, 4 AM, and were still greeted with a wide awake and gracious clerk at check in. She was very helpful, and efficient considering the hour. She probably recognized the ""traveler fatigue"", and proceeded accordingly. We are planning another trip to Chicago in the spring, and will most likely stay at the Intercontinental. Everyone we encountered from the front desk clereks, concierge, bell captain, housekeeping, and valet was gracious, and made our stay there a wonderful experience.",nan,1,ex3643
expedia,I was disappointed that neither of the rooms I requested were ready at check-in. I was there at 4pm and a long line was formed to do the same. Your staff worked quickly to help everyone. I did accept a change of bedding for one room (2 doubles to a king with roll-a-way). My deluxe suite would not be ready for an hour or so. As we had reservations for dinner at 6:15 p.m. I was inconvenienced to use a friend's room to clean up. I realize that the hotel was busy due to the holiday season but I had thought I would be able to get into my room to freshen up before my dinner plans. Jeryl Lundberg,nan,1,ex3644
expedia,Rooms are very small compared to other hotels.,nan,1,ex3645
expedia,Parking was a problem for us after traveling 600+ miles. Did not know where the nearest parking area was,nan,1,ex3646
expedia,"We have stayed at the Intercontinental before yet we were on the nice side. There are 2 towers and one is much, much nicer than the other. This stay we had a very cramped room that was no better than a 2 1/2 star hotel. Our shower curtain was ripped and hanging off, the bathroom was subpar. Overall, the room was way below expectations for a ""4 star"" hotel. The location is great...close to everything. Staff was very friendly as well. If booking, request the updated tower! Kind of disappointed....",nan,1,ex3647
expedia,"the IH treated us like second class citizens because we booked on Hotels.com. We were stuck in the north tower which has very tiny rooms, even smaller than the surrounding boutique hotels. We won't be returning. Hotels.com should explain the room you are selecting at the time of your reservation. The Superior Room equals the north tower and means you will get a cramped room. The IH manager couldn't confirm that they offer any of their larger rooms on Hotels.com. Buyer beware!",nan,1,ex3648
expedia,It was great location and hotel. Would def go back,nan,1,ex3649
expedia,The hotel and staff were kind and courteous. Valet parking was prompt and very convenient.,nan,1,ex3650
expedia,It was a very nice stay in a beautiful hotel at a great location on Mich. Ave. We've stayed there before and will do so again.,nan,1,ex3651
expedia,"This stay was a gift I gave my daughter. it was a romantic get away. They loved it and raved about it. They asked to have their room changed to the old historic section of the hotel which had more charm and character. It was like going back in time , but with all the modern conveniences and perks. The location in Chicago was perfect. They can't wait to stay there again.",nan,1,ex3652
expedia,"The first room that we were given had a door connecting it to the room next door. It quickly became apparent that there was not much insulation between the rooms as we could hear the conversation of our neighbors. I found this surprising for such a nice hotel. However, after asking the front desk, they gave us a new room without a connecting door.",nan,1,ex3653
expedia,Awesome location. Very comfortable bed. Nice pool. Helpful staff. Bus system easily accessed.,nan,1,ex3654
expedia,"Great hotel experience. By going mid-week, the cost was extremely reasonable.",nan,1,ex3655
expedia,This is a beautiful hotel. No doubt. I know my room was discounted and in hide sight I should have said something at the time. But I have thought about it and I need to speak up. Room 469 should not be used for occupancy. It was SO loud due to some mechanical system that sits directly outside the window. I literally could not sleep. I am a very experienced traveler with tons of international experience so I feel I am qualified to compare. This very attractive rate will interest the likes of tourists and young families. I promise they will have a bad experience/memories if they are given this room to sleep. This is the first time I have ever responded to any review request with anything but a positive comment. But I wish management would consider making Room 469 a utility closet. Thanks.,nan,1,ex3656
expedia,Parking is expensive and everything is an extra charge. But nice.,nan,1,ex3657
expedia,The hotel was nice in the lobby and room. The lobby Christmas decorations was beautiful.,nan,1,ex3658
expedia,"They didn't have our reservation when we arrived so the check-in was quite delayed. Apparently the communication between Hotels.com and the Hotel Intercontinental had a breakdown. I left my phone in the car with the confirmation email. When I went to get my phone from the car to supply the confirmation number, the retrieval was delayed because the Valet had an accident with my wife's brand new BMW. The overall stay was nice but I think I'll be parking my own vehicle unless I have rental cars. Off to the Body Shop.",nan,1,ex3659
expedia,The room was nice and clean and the people were friendly. The hallways and elevator lobbies were a little run down and not very clean. There was a half eaten slice of pizza on the floor in the elevator lobby and someones dinner dishes sat in the hallway for hours.,nan,1,ex3660
expedia,Great location. Nearby parking is expensive. Hotel shows some signs of age but is generally well kept. Pillows on the bed were too thick and gave me a sore neck.,nan,1,ex3661
expedia,"Great stay, as always! Can't beat the location for shopping convenience. A fun place to stay as there is lots of activity and the close proximity to stores and restaurants is perfect!",nan,1,ex3662
expedia,"Friendly staff, everyone was attentive, room was great. Only had one small issue. I placed my order for breakfast room service on the door knob at least an hour before the deadline and found it still hanging on my door in the morning when I looked down the hall to see if my food was coming yet after it was an hour late. It was minor compared to the great service otherwise.",nan,1,ex3663
expedia,"Beautiful hotel with traditional hospitality and comfortable contemporary rooms. Amenities fantastic, even a small area in the mini frig for personal items. Well appointed and well thought out.",nan,1,ex3664
expedia,"I went to a concert, that was great. Great location",nan,1,ex3665
expedia,"On an overnight stay with friends, we enjoyed viewing the Christmas decorations, seeing a play, and relishing the excellent food experiences that Chicago has to offer. The hotel location is outstanding and convenient. Our room was quite large, most comfortable, and quiet. We needed non-down bedding because of allergies, and we were delighted with the bedding and the firmness of the mattresses. The bathroom was also large, with both a tub and a stand-up shower.",nan,1,ex3666
expedia,"Short stay with my son, bit of Xmas shopping, sightseeing etc",nan,1,ex3667
expedia,Over rated I got the feeling that the lobby was in a mall food court.,nan,1,ex3668
expedia,They overbooked the first night and had to move us to trump towers. Not complaining about that. Staff at the intercontinental was great.,nan,1,ex3669
expedia,"Great location, would easily recommand a friend. Easy access to everything. Cleanliness. Friendly. And good value",nan,1,ex3670
expedia,Overall very nice. Wish they had a moderately priced resturaunt on site. Also the goodies in the room should be under lock and key with a better way of keeping track...we were charged for OJ and never touched any of them.,nan,1,ex3671
expedia,Received double beds wanted queen had to use my cell phone phone didn't work was left on hold for 40 minutes would not let my wife up to room after 1 she called me on cell to get dress and come down to lobby,nan,1,ex3672
expedia,The location is perfect for downtown shopping and fun. One issue was they wanted to charge extra for both wifi and the workout facilities.,nan,1,ex3673
expedia,Staff very helpful...room very small but nice Had a beautiful view of all the air conditioners on a roof Since it was only one night and I grew up in the city it was fine,nan,1,ex3674
expedia,The service was very good but the rooms were very small. The photos make them look a lot bigger. I actually called the reception when we got to our room because it was so small and I thought it would be bigger based on the photos at hotels.com The room I booked was the superior king. Maybe the deluxe rooms are bigger?,nan,1,ex3675
expedia,"Great location, close to shopping and restaurants. The basic rooms are very tiny not great for more than two guests. Staff very courteous and friendly.",nan,1,ex3676

expedia,"The hotel staff was well-trained, friendly, and very helpful. Thisi is our 6th visit and certainly will not be our last. These comments apply to the entire staff.",nan,1,ex3680
expedia,"I was very displeased when upon check-in, I was informed the room I had reserved (two people, two beds) was not available. I was told since I had booked through a third party, they weren't required to honor my confirmation. I ended up with one king size bed, which was not at all what I wanted. I was told I could have a roll away bed brought to the room. Again, not at all what I wanted. The next morning, I really wanted food... the area that had once been a very nice dining area, is now a Starbucks. (not at all what I wanted for breakfast)",nan,1,ex3681
expedia,"My wife and I were looking for a place to stay the Wednesday night before Thanksgiving in order to be close enough to walk to State Street for the parade. The Intercontinental was the perfect location. A 15 minute walk down Michigan Avenue to Randolph then to State Street and we had a great view of the parade. The hotel is very comfortable and clean. We had drinks and appetizers at Michael Jordan's restaurant bar in the lobby, the bar tenders provided superior service and the restaurant menu is available at the bar, a good option if the restaurant wait is excessive.",nan,1,ex3682
expedia,"Great hotel, perfect location, staff friendly and helpful. Room clean and well appointed. Breakfast was included in our stay, excellent in quality and presentation.",nan,1,ex3683

expedia,"When I checked in they only had one person working the checking in desk although they had room for 10, there was only one person in front of me checking out and they had a dispute with their bill so it took over 10 minutes before I was helped. The rooms are extremely small. The pool area is not clean, there was water all over the floor which made for a hazardous experience at the pool.",nan,1,ex3686
expedia,"Great hotel, in a great location. Rooms a little on the small side, but clean and comfortable.",nan,1,ex3687
expedia,"The hotel is a bit worn out and in need of a refresh. Faded carpets; small threadbare towels you expect to find in a two-star hotel; and a saggy old arm-chair in the deluxe room. The shower/bath combo was also two-star stuff, complete with erratic caulking. At least the shower curtain didn't stick to me. Bed was comfortable and the location and view was fantastic.",nan,1,ex3688
expedia,Room was very small..felt a lilittle claustrophobic..,nan,1,ex3689
expedia,"My airplane delayed and I arrived at Intercontinental hotel 2am in the morning. I was tired. The Intercontinental hotel manager was especially kind and gave me a really very nice big room at high floor. The room is more like a junior suite with nice sitting area , sofa and desk. The bath room is all marble with both tub and glass shower. All elegant and well designed. the towel was fluffy. The bed was fantastic. I slept soundly after a day of hassle in traveling. The hotel manager also give me a complimentary coupon of Starbucks fresh brewed coffee. Next morning , I picked up a nice cup of hot coffee, walk out of Hotel , it is right on Chicago's Magnificent Mile. I Walk to AON center up to the 80th floor, Mid American Club for breakfast and enjoyed the wonderful view of Lake Michigan and awesome city skyline.I walk back in pleasant sunshine on Michigan ave which was lined with beautiful shops. I stayed at the same Intercontinental during 2013 Christmas holiday with my daughter. I reserved a suite. I was pleasantly surprised, the hotel gave us the 2 bed room suite occupied the hotel's entire top floor with living room and private elevator.

Never had any problems. this time stayed in the 'Newer' side of the hotel, still very nice however the rooms are a bit smaller and therefore more crowded, also the carpet in the halls is amongst the ugliest carpets I have ever seen. Still a great place to stay, and we'll likely stay here again for our family getaways to downtown. BEST SWIMMING POOL IN THE CITY.",nan,1,ex3693

expedia,BATHROOM room 529 not designed well. Registration can not find my reservation that was done through Expedia. Hotel personnel suggested I need to correct this error. I have been using for several years now. I go to Europe at least twice a year and do not have a problem. Do not put a blame on me when Conrad have incompetent personnel.,nan,1,ex3701
expedia,Room was very comfortable - lots of lobby room to relax in.,nan,1,ex3702
expedia,The check in staff were awesome. Upon check in they gave an updated weather forecast that instantly took care of the fear I had of spending a rainy day in Chicago. The cleaning staff provided me with extra bottles of water which is always a plus. The bathroom did leave me a little uncomfortable as their was hair in the shower faucet and a strand of hair on top of the comforter. The room size was great. The view was great. The staff was great.,nan,1,ex3703
expedia,"We planed to look around navy pier and millenium park, and to cruise in Chicago River. We parked our car at public parking lot with a reasonable price, which was just across this hotel. We took a taxi to move to the Loop one time because of rain, but would never do that if the weather was fine. The location of this hotel is so convenient that walking is just enough to look around the center of Chicago. The room was average but clean, and complimentary apples and sample breads for breakfast was also helpful for us. Thanks to this hotel, our trip was more enjoyable!",nan,1,ex3704
expedia,Great Hotel Great Location Great staff and beautiful room,nan,1,ex3705

And rooms were ready. There is an enclosed walkway to a shopping mall. So many great restaurants within one block of the hotel. Joe's Stone Crab is must visit. If you are a foodie, then another must visit is Eataly around the corner for imported food items, including chocolates, and many dining options upstairs. Nice, large bathroom with separate water closet. Would definitely stay at the Conrad in the future.",nan,1,ex3710

We have been coming to the city for about five years, and The Conrad is now in a tie with our favorite hotel downtown!",nan,1,ex3715
expedia,"The Conrad Chicago is a beautiful hotel & has everything you would expect from a 4 star hotel.

Location can't be beat - it's perfect.",nan,1,ex3716

expedia,"Registered with suffix Roman Numeral 3 to correspond to cred card. My wife checked in early; told no reservation. Asked If any rooms available; told would have to check w/ superv. No superv or given answer. My wife stepped away to accommodate other guests to register. I pulled off toll rd to find hotel's 3 #. Reserv under 3 rather than first letter of last name.

expedia,The room service response time was horrible. There were three phones in my room and only one worked which was in the bathrroom. I booked the room for a double bed. I received a one bed. The hotel didn't have any other rooms. Not even a suite. I was very displeased and will not stay at the Conrad chicago ever again. I need to be compensated for not meeting my specifications.

expedia,"Very convenient location, near shopping mall and public transportation. Great service, clean room, good view",nan,1,ex3737
expedia,Parking was an ease. If you're like me and can't afford valet then this hotel is great. Self parking is literally right across from the hotel so you don't have to go far. Plus the street wasn't too busy when I was there so I wasn't waiting forever to turn into the parking ramp. Room was great nice and spacious. overall experience with this hotel was amazing,nan,1,ex3738
expedia,"The Conrad is a very nice hotel for the price. It's really nice hotel, period, but given I was able to book this for such a reasonable rate and be right downtown is amazing.

expedia,Great location. Luxurious room. Great staff. What more could you want,nan,1,ex3741
expedia,My daughter and I went to Chicago for a long weekend vacation. Our stay at the Conrad Chicago was excellent from the moment we were greeted by Mauricio.

expedia,"A block from Michigan Ave and connected to a mall, this hotel is perfect for anyone who wants to shop in Chicago. The room was nice and clean, the only complaint is that the minifridge didn't work very well and all of their appliances were compatible with the old apple chargers (4/4s), but that's knit-picking. The workout room was AMAZING. Lots of treadmills/elipticals, free weights and even some machines and medicine balls.",nan,1,ex3749
expedia,"It was very sofisticated, comfort and relax stay in US. Conrad is located in Downtown's safe area, it is also very convinient to enjoy Jazz or Blues at night though I visited Chicao in business. It is highy recomended to book.",nan,1,ex3750
expedia,"We try to stay at different hotels when we visit Chicago. But this one is going to be tough to beat. We did stay at the "" the tall shiny one on Wacker a few years ago and all I can say is the Conrad is right up in that category.",nan,1,ex3751
expedia,"I booked through Expedia with one rate, at checkout they had charged me a different (higher) rate. Thankfully I caught it and they resolved the issue quickly. The hotel is really pretty, has a boutique feel. The room was large, there was a shower stall and bath tub rather than a typical shower/tub combination. The beds were really comfortable and there were enough pillows for 4 other people to stay with me! It was perfect. I grabbed a yummy latte on my way out of town at the coffee shop in the lobby, passed on the yummy looking baked goods though.",nan,1,ex3752

Also told me I could park across the street in the parking garage instead of paying extra for the valet to park it in the same garage. They even put it on your hotel bill for you. We will definitely stay there again.,nan,1,ex3754
expedia,"Very nice hotel, convenient location and will be returning!",nan,1,ex3755
expedia,Hotel was overbooked and had no rooms. They made arrangements at a nearby hotel and sent me off with a voucher and cover letter to cover the 1 night stay. I chose to walk even though it was frigid. The Conrad had no cabs waiting and the Bellman was absent. The staff was apologetic and very effective.,nan,1,ex3756
expedia,The Conrad is everything that one looks for in a fine hotel. Great staff. Superb location. Wonderful rooms. I would recommend to anyone.,nan,1,ex3757

expedia,"The customer service was great. The rooms were clean and very comfortable. The food was good. One draw back - room service and the restuarant are highly over priced. I ordered two waffles, coffee and a juice and the bill was $60.00 with tip! Otherwise it really is a fantastic hotel.",nan,1,ex3768

expedia,"The hotel was beautiful. Found a GREAT rate thru hotels.com. The woman who checked us in was rude but all other staff was amazing and pleasant. I just wasn't expecting the $100+ fee for incidentals/per night. I think that's excessive. Most hotels have a flat rate that doesn't exceed $100....I just I should've inquired. Otherwise everything was great! I love Chicago. Many tourist attractions were in walking distance. I will be back in Chicago for vacation ASAP and if the price is right, I'll stay at the Conrad P.S. I really like that they provided qtips and cotton balls in the bathrooms! lol",nan,1,ex3774
expedia,"It is a great hotel, overall the staff was very service oriented, helped a lot on recomendations on the area attractions and restaurants, except for the bar tender that was rude to us and in a bad mood all time we spent at the bar, and we received the same comments from a couple that were sitting next to us.

expedia,Awesome hotel and staff. Everything about is perfect!!!,nan,1,ex3778
expedia,"The hotel is in good shape in general and well located. Although the restaurant is weak in terms of service quality and variety of choices, the overall service quality of the hotel is very good. It has 2 entrances, one for cars and one for the pedestrians (via a small shopping mall), which makes it convenient as the weather in Chicago is not welcoming in winter. The shops, cafes, restaurants and other points of interest makes it perfect for staying. As a usual Conrad guest, I would recommend it highly.",nan,1,ex3779

expedia,"One of the best locations in Chicago. It's even connected to shopping that leads you onto Michigan AVE. They have a nice lobby bar and terrace.

A great stay though and would 100% recommend.",nan,1,ex3789

I had requested that the room be cleaned while we were out for the procedure bc I would need to return to rest. Didn't happen. Waited over an hour in the lobby while they sent someone up. Finally gave up and went to rest bc I was exhausted. They gave us dessert vouchers for our troubles. Dessert vouchers? Really? That's exceptional service?,nan,1,ex3793

My trip was extended a day but when I called to extend a day - was told NO we don't have availability, no problem went to Expedia and started to look for another hotel, and low and behold there was a listing for rooms available at the Conrad.

expedia,"Clean, well located and accommodating. I would prefer not to add any more at this time.",nan,1,ex3817
expedia,Excellent hotel. Great staff! You can't go wrong with this one.,nan,1,ex3818
expedia,"Last minute, we decided to take advantage of a nice January weekend and head into the city. We booked a room last minute and because it was a slower time during the year, were able to secure a wonderful room at the Conrad. We will definitely return.",nan,1,ex3819
expedia,This hotel has always served us well for a weekend getaway. The location is perfect and provides close access to dining and entertainment.,nan,1,ex3820
expedia,Great service. All staff were very friendly and helpful. Nice bathroom with separate shower and large tub. Location is great and connected to the Nordstrom mall on Michigan Avenue.,nan,1,ex3821
expedia,"Everything was fantastic. It's hard to wrap my head around a $69 valet parking fee for one night. Room service was fast. Called to have them remove the cart and no one ever came. Needless to say I put it in the hallway. Breakfast was really good. Pillow menu was a nice touch. TV instructions could be easier to understand. However, it was cold and you can text the valet to bring your car around. By the time you're checked out your car is nice aND warm. I would stay here again especially if they lower the valet price.",nan,1,ex3822
expedia,"Perfect stay, very good location, nice room, friendly staff",nan,1,ex3823

expedia,Very clean and impressibe accomodations. Cool 5th floor lobbt. Within walking distance to great restaurants.,nan,1,ex3828
expedia,"When I checked in at the front desk, I was told, I had requested a accessible room, I told them that was incorrect, that I asked for a regular room with double beds. I said, but I booked a regular room, the gentleman said well that's not what we have down for you. He said, you booked it through Expedia, that I would have to take it up with Expedia. I told him I booked through Hotel.com. The gentleman said he had a regular room with double beds, I said I will take it, he said he would have to charge me an extra $.. The rooms were going for the same price, why the extra $10. Upon checking out, I was charged $ for parking, in which I did not drive to Chicago, a real nightmare for my Christmas getaway. While standing line, I heard other people complaining about their billing. I was refunded my $.. dollars but I will Never stay at the Conrad hotel again.",nan,1,ex3829
expedia,"Great location, good staff and service.",nan,1,ex3830
expedia,Nice property in a good location. King suite was nicely equipped and decorated. It was clean. The staff were pleasant and tried to be helpful. The service however had numerous missteps. Arrived early with prior notification. Had to wait over 3 hours for a room on a Sunday. Stored baggage was to be delivered to room when ready. Luggage misplaced and not delivered for over 1/2 hour after arriving at room. No bedding in the room for pullout couch. Calling for bedding at 10:30pm when discovered yielded another 1/2 hour wait. Candy found in unmade pullout couch.,nan,1,ex3831
expedia,Great Hotel in the best area. You can go north or south a few blocks and get to anything.,nan,1,ex3832
expedia,Comfortable rooms. Great amenities and hotel service. Location is perfect for shopping.,nan,1,ex3833
expedia,We travel to chicago often and have stayed at several hotels. This location was excellent and the rooms were very spacious. The Conrad is at the top of our list. We will definitely return.,nan,1,ex3834
expedia,Peaceful,nan,1,ex3835
expedia,"Really nice to go from your room to Nordstrom without going outside when it is freezing! And when you do go outside, its a quick walk across the street to many more stores and restaurants.",nan,1,ex3836
expedia,"The Conrad was perfect for my business trip. It was very clean and quiet, and in a great location, near restaurants and the train. At the time, there was construction on the hotel, so one of the elevators was out of use, but other than that the stay was very hassle-free.",nan,1,ex3837
expedia,Perfectly priced,nan,1,ex3838
expedia,"Beautiful hotel, wonderful service. Have stayed in pricier hotels with higher acclaim, will never stay anywhere else in Chicago. Clean, beautiful, perfect location right off of Michigan Ave. A FANTASTIC hotel.",nan,1,ex3839
expedia,"Very nice hotel. The conbstruction was a small problem, but overall wonderful stay.",nan,1,ex3840
expedia,Great location! Access to everything. Rooms were fantastic!,nan,1,ex3841
expedia,"Beautiful hotel in what is, in my opinion, one of the best locations in Chicago! Service is top notch, and the bed is extremely comfy. We downloaded the concierge app, and that was really helpful too!",nan,1,ex3842
expedia,"This was our second time staying here, and looking for many more in the future. Staff was super friendly and the location was perfect for what we love to do while visiting.",nan,1,ex3843
expedia,Just an average Chicago hotel I was expecting much more since it was Conrad hotel,nan,1,ex3844
expedia,"Great place, great location, great service",nan,1,ex3845
expedia,"I found the Conrad very standard but the price was luxurious. I expected a higher standard for the expense. Greeting was poor, nobody assisted me with my bags and I felt like a second class customer. As an international guest, I used a travel money card and nobody explained that my line of credit would be tied up with a hold on the funds well past my complete settlement of the bill. If I'd known this I would have used a different type of card. I had no access to my funds for several days follwing check out because the room fee plus $100 per day was not cleared immediately. Conrad blamed the bank and the bank blamed Conrad.",nan,1,ex3846
expedia,"Great Hotel for a family stay in Chicago. This review is of a King Junior Suite - cant comment on a standard hotel room but the suite was perfect. The Hotel is impeccably clean, the suites are very roomy and comfortable. Nice Fitness Center, great location. Really, the only downside considering this is a luxury hotel is the absence of a pool or hot tub.",nan,1,ex3847
expedia,"I've traveled the world over and usually stay in four or five star hotels. I'm pretty demanding, but not unreasonably so. This hotel and staff exceeded my expectations in every area. I just can't say enough good things about the Conrad! High ups, guys.",nan,1,ex3848
expedia,"First time stay at a Conrad and in this location of CHI. Would definitely return. the only downfall was the lounge and the bar service. Very slow, non responsive to the arrival of customers and the staff on all 3 nights were obvioulsy very new or just not very good in the service industry.",nan,1,ex3849
expedia,Everything was good exempt I booked a handicap room on accident and the shower was a pain because water leaked everywhere. Other then that I love the location. Everything was very comfortable and the staff was very friendly.,nan,1,ex3850
expedia,"Excellent hotel, excellent location. Would definitely stay again. If i'm picking fault, the only thing I would change would be adding a bath to the bathroom (there is only shower).",nan,1,ex3851
expedia,"Great location, nice price and lovely rooms, bathrooms might need a little updating but even then, the rooms were still great. Will stay there again next time we are in town. The location alone make it a must and such a great atmosphere inside the lobby.",nan,1,ex3852
expedia,"Hotel was nice, room service was very poor. 3 of 6 meals had major issues. Rooms were comfortable. One of the ladies at the front desk was quite rude.",nan,1,ex3853
expedia,Could have used an extra towel,nan,1,ex3854
expedia,"i have stayed at several hotels in the city over the last 12 years and this one is now my favorite, will definitely be coming back if I am able to get the great deal I received on Hotels.com. This hotel has everything and then some, and the area is perfect for all the city has to offer in entertainment, food and shopping.",nan,1,ex3855
expedia,"My three daughters and I come every year for our annual Xmas shopping/bonding weekend. We wait all year for our time away. This is the second year we've stayed at the Conrad. Love, love love it. Very convenient to Michigan Ave. and everyone always wonderful. See you next year!",nan,1,ex3856
expedia,Great location. Attached to a mall which leads out to Michigan Ave so great shopping and nice restaurants are only minutes away. Wonderful breakfast menu. The only downside is the parking rate which was more than the daily rate for my rental car but this is typical for this Chicago neighborhood. And you really don't need a car because you can walk to everything.,nan,1,ex3857
expedia,Peanut butter stuffed French toast was awesome! Close to shopping.,nan,1,ex3858
expedia,Delivered what was promised. Staff was friendly.,nan,1,ex3859
expedia,"We decided to go downtown at the last minute. We got a great price and requested a room along with Michigan Avenue so we could view the light parade from our room. We go the room we requested and had a great view of the parade. The room was clean, modern and had everything stocked that you might need. The staff was friendly. I would book this hotel the next time we decide to take a weekend trip to the city",nan,1,ex3860
expedia,Amazing location. Had a great stay while celebrating our anniversary.,nan,1,ex3861
expedia,Great hotel overall. The bar and restaurant were a bit pricey. Nice room with comfy bed and the bathroom was plenty big.,nan,1,ex3862
expedia,"The Conrad has always been a great choice of hotels for family trips to Chicago. The rooms and amenities have always exceeded my expectations. Also, the proximity to shopping on Michigan Avenue is excellent and the connection to North Bridge mall is good during cold weather. There are an abundance of restaurants and pubs in the area providing a great variety of food and entertainment options. Great location stay for the Magnificent Mile Light Festival.",nan,1,ex3863
expedia,Curbside check in was a breeze even with all the chaos of the Downtown Festival of Lights parade. Don't mistake The Conrad Hotel for The Marriott like several of us did this day bcuz they are adjacent to one another and their curbside seems awefully familiar. Other than that this Hotel rates a 10!,nan,1,ex3864
expedia,"Hotel was clean, comfortable and quiet. I believe it was newly renovated. I would definitely stay here again.",nan,1,ex3865
expedia,Everything was great!,nan,1,ex3866

expedia,"It was a great place to stay, and would recommend it to anyone for a getaway stay!!!",nan,1,ex3869
expedia,Very chic yet comfortable hotel conveniently located on Michigan Ave. Staff are very friendly & helpful. I've stayed in several hotels in Chicago but this is definitely my favourite.,nan,1,ex3870
expedia,We had a great experience at the Conrad. My husband and I went for a weekend trip and were very impressed with the staff and vibe at the hotel. The beds were comfortable and we were able to walk to tons if restaurants/bars.,nan,1,ex3871
expedia,Excellent location on Michigan Ave.; awesome service! Thanks,nan,1,ex3872
expedia,"From start to finish, it was a lovely stay. Super friendly and helpful staff. Great amenities. Superb location.",nan,1,ex3873
expedia,"The restaurant is small, but the food is good. Lobby is beautiful, concierge service was excellent and people from the front desk too.",nan,1,ex3874
expedia,"I love staying at Contads. Beautiful hotel, well-trained staff, nice amenities. I have ti say, though, these negatives were disappointing: the entrance through the mall takes too long, the tv in the room malfunctioned in an annoying way(horrible feedback when turningit on--until you change to a station; facilities guy said its true of all in hotel), lights in bathroom buzzed when on. I'd stay again but these weee drawbacks.",nan,1,ex3875
expedia,"The only minor issue was the toilet handle being very loose and sometimes made it hard to flush the toilet. Other than that the room was very nice, the location was great and all service was outstanding. We really enjoyed our trip.",nan,1,ex3876
expedia,"From check-in the check-out, this hotel offered excellent service and comfort. We had a large room on the 16th floor. The bathroom was especially well-finished with a sunken bathtub and separate toilet area. The bed was very comfortable, and housekeeping staff did a great job each day refreshing the room. The Conrad is in a central location in downtown Chicago. Concierge staff was helpful with recommendations. Thanks for the daily fresh, green apples! Nice details throughout.",nan,1,ex3877
expedia,Very central hotel. Our room was spacious and pleasant. Staff friendly and helpful.,nan,1,ex3878
expedia,Great stay.. If your looking for quality look no further.,nan,1,ex3879
expedia,Great stay. Convenient location. Highly recommend!,nan,1,ex3880
expedia,What a perfect location for shopping. Not impressed with the food choices in hotel but surrounded by plenty of other choices. Bartender could be a little more polite!,nan,1,ex3881
expedia,"Hotel is in a great location downtown and attached to a mall. Water Tower place is just a short walk away. Very attentive staff and very nice rooms......but no coffee maker in the room. A Bose sound system on the TV, but no coffee maker.",nan,1,ex3882
expedia,All was amazing except for 2 minor issues: The room stayed a bit warm and the heating/air conditioning unit wasn't able to bring the room to desired temperature. The 2nd issue was the fact that the front desk staff answered and helped people who called in while there was a line of people waiting at the desk to be helped.,nan,1,ex3883
expedia,Fantastic deal on a terrific hotel made for a great weekend on the mile in Chicago. Ideal location.,nan,1,ex3884
expedia,"My boyfriend and I stayed for one night for our anniversary. We had such a wonderful time, I wish we would have stayed longer. The hotel is modern, immaculately clean, beautifully decorated and just all-around excellent. The front desk staff was friendly and courteous, the restaurant and bar staff was polite and attentive, and the hotel had some terrific amenities. The hotel is located above a mall and right next to Michigan Ave. shopping. Perfect location! The hotel room (king bed for two) was spacious, clean, and comfortable. The decor was beautiful. The bathroom was huge and I'd even say glamorous. The giant bathtub prompted my boyfriend to take his first bubblebath in several years. The bed was large and very comfortable, and most importantly, the room was very quiet. There was a large TV with cable and available DVDs, a Bose stereo system, and a mini fridge. The hotel also offered free wifi, which was nice. There were some other perks offered (pillow bar (!), mini bar stuff, room service, etc.) that we didnt take advantage of, but it is nice to know a lot of things were readily available at our request. I loved the Conrad Chicago and will most definitely return for another stay. A fantastic hotel in a perfect location!",nan,1,ex3885
expedia,Awesome! Great price! Great location. Definitely will be back! Bar and common areas were beautiful!,nan,1,ex3886
expedia,We liked the hotel very much. Our stay was short but very nice and the customer service was great!,nan,1,ex3887
expedia,The perfect place in winter It is on top of the mall It's seems a bit old And if you don't pay for good view the view will be bad But I know I will come again,nan,1,ex3888
expedia,"Really nice hotel, close to the action, yet you feel you have a reprieve from the mayhem of Michigan ave.",nan,1,ex3889
expedia,"Spacious room, average front desk , good location. Hotel bar staff were bland and unapproachable ; friendly housekeeping. Gym is well equipped.",nan,1,ex3890
expedia,"Came to the Conrad after a weekend at the Courtyard Marriott on Ontario. Only made the change because the rate offered by the Conrad was so attractive. Didn't expect the beautiful room, comfy bed and spectacular bathroom. Location is perfect. Only disappointment was the view . . . but given the rate we were paying, I really couldn't complain.",nan,1,ex3891
expedia,"I spent five days in the Conrad in October while attending a conference at a neighbouring hotel. I chose to stay at the Conrad, rather than the conference hotel, based on reviews I read online and believe me I made the right choice. I received excellent service from every employee I dealt with, and the facilities were both comfortable and attractive. My only quibble is the price of some of the onsite food, particularly breakfast items. 6$ for a mug of tea!",nan,1,ex3892
expedia,Perfect location for us. The service really was first rate. Very pleased with everything.,nan,1,ex3893
expedia,The parking expense was more than I had in CA so that was disappointing,nan,1,ex3894
expedia,"I chose the Conrad Chicago for a short stay in July. The trip was special as it was my mother's first time in Chicago. I wanted a hotel that was not only premium, but in a great location as well. I was definitely pleased to see how beautiful the hotel is. The outdoor terrace not only lovely, but a great place to take pictures. The room was spotless and the bathroom was spacious with a separate room for the toilet. All in all, we had a fantastic time and I look forward to staying at the Conrad again.",nan,1,ex3895
expedia,"We really enjoyed our stay The rooms are quite large and the bathrooms are wonderful! The showers are huge. Staff is very friendly. Although there was free coffee in the lobby, I wish there were coffee makers in the rooms. I wish you didn't have to take two different elevators to go from the street entrance on Rush to your room. It is very convenient to have the Shops at North Bridge Mall attached to the hotel. We would definitely recommend this hotel.",nan,1,ex3896
expedia,"Spur of the moment trip to Chicago. Booked room on expedia. Most likely the worst room at the Conrad. Extremely small with only a single small window in the corner. I feel that when I book on expedia, Conrad gives the worst room. Hotel was not full so we could have been offered a different room. Sound in the tv is terrible.",nan,1,ex3897
expedia,"Got such a good rate from Expedia I was worried the hotel wouldn't be so good, but it was excellent - in location, standard, quietness, service. Everything was all we could have asked for - and because we booked through Expedia we got free breakfast vouchers - something we weren't expecting but was a lovely finishing touch. Would definitely use again.",nan,1,ex3898
expedia,"The location of this hotel is excellent. Right off of Michigan Avenue in the heart of the Magnificent Mile. The lobby area is very nice and a great place to unwnd after a long day of shopping. The room was nicely appointed, although we had some issues with the toilet. After two attempts to fix it, they moved us to another room and we had no issues. I would certainly stay at this hotel again the next time I am in Chicago!",nan,1,ex3899
expedia,"We were there for the Chicago Marathon and not in the hotel much. But it was very nice, clean and super comfortable. Great location in downtown Chicago.",nan,1,ex3900
expedia,"Really nice hotel in a wonderful location. First trip to Chicago and found this to be a good homebase. High-end hotel without the stuffiness. The staff were very attentive and friendly. A little disappointed the windows don't open at all, but on the otherside they were so well-sealed there was very little noise (nearby construction, outside music at bar etc.). Made it a very restful oasis in a busy city. Large bath with separate WC and comfy tub. Easy walk to groceries (including Trader Joes).",nan,1,ex3901
expedia,Great hotel in the heart of the city. The room was the cleanest and most comfortable in Chicago. Great value for the price,nan,1,ex3902
expedia,Das Hotel liegt im Herzen von Chicago und viel kann zu Fuss erreicht werden. Best French Toast in town!!!,nan,1,ex3903
expedia,"Nice hotel. Location is excellent (right on the magnificent mile next to Nordstroms) and rooms are large, quiet and comfortable. I don't know if all the rooms are handicapped accessible but ours was. For the location and niceness of the hotel, the price was fantastic. The staff were friendly and helpful.",nan,1,ex3904
expedia,Great place!,nan,1,ex3905
expedia,The best hotel and location in chicago! We had such a wonderful time here. We will defently be back.,nan,1,ex3906
expedia,The hotel was the best I have stayed at in Chicago. Being from Chicago it is hard to surprise me but the Conrad did just that. Jes at the front desk was fantastic and our room was beyond what we imaged. Our new hotel when we go home!,nan,1,ex3907
expedia,All was great. The location was pretty ideal and the restaurant had a nice breakfast and great service. Outdoor cityscape with movie running and dinner location was fun to see.,nan,1,ex3908
expedia,Perfect location. Get a top room otherwise your view will not be worth the price.,nan,1,ex3909
expedia,"The hotel staff was so nice, they went out of their way to make sure we had everything we needed. Great location. Very nice hotel.",nan,1,ex3910
expedia,This hotel seems to want to save on onduty staff. The hotel was clean and comfortable however whenever you looked for anyone on the staff they were hard to find. They had few people anywhere. Only one or two people were ever at the front desk even when very busy.,nan,1,ex3911
expedia,We were very pleased with our hotel. Nice and clean. Easy access. The restaurant is on the pricey side. Overall enjoyed our stay very much.,nan,1,ex3912
expedia,"I had a great stay at this hotel. Location is fantastic, minutes from a ton of restaurants, shopping, and the subway. Service is on par with a hotel of this caiber. Friendly staff from concierge to front desk to housekeeping. Room condition was immaculate though decor is a bit conservative. Bathroom is huge and beds ultra comfy. At $200 a night out the door, this was a great deal in my opinion. I would stay here again.",nan,1,ex3913
expedia,We love the Conrad. Customer service is the best. Comfortable beds. Great space. Close to dining and shopping. Easy access to Nordstroms! This is our favorite hotel in Chicago!,nan,1,ex3914
expedia,"Bed was comfortable, bathroom was nice and big. View was kind of terrible, but that's okay. The location is great if you like to shop and close to the El. Would stay here again in a heartbeat.",nan,1,ex3915
expedia,"property was excellent and well situated. Staff were all efficient, friendly and helpful. My only complaint was that the fitness room did not have the cardio equipment that I prefer (generally found in fitness centers) but was open 24 hours and otherwise well equipped.",nan,1,ex3916
expedia,Beautiful hotel...wonderful staff...they kindly extended my check out time to accommodate my needs!,nan,1,ex3917
expedia,"I had never stayed at a Conrad before and if I could, I would exclusively stay there from now on. The staff was incredibly friendly, the room was incredible and I can't wait to go back!",nan,1,ex3918
expedia,We stay in the city 4 or 5 times a year for a quick getaway.....with the exception of possibly The Trump....I think The Conrad is our our new favorite. It might not have the views that Trump has but at half the price who cares. The rooms are just as nice and for a $14 upgrade on here the room was huge. Not a complaint....room was spotless and the bed/pillows were outstanding. Highly recommend The Conrad.,nan,1,ex3919
expedia,Property's great but they would not accept Hilton Honors because we booked through hotels.com. Too bad. - all other hotels accept for rooms service and restaurant charges..,nan,1,ex3920
expedia,I was able to purchase a suite for the weekend and it was so amazing especially at night. The view cannot be beat.,nan,1,ex3921
expedia,Overall a great experience. My wife and I had a great weekend in Chicago. Lots of great restaurants close by. Breakfast in the Terrace room was fantastic.,nan,1,ex3922
expedia,This place is amazing. It had everything we needed and wanted and even more. The staff was extremely helpful and kind. I would recommend this place to everyone. Is was by far the best hotel I have ever stayed in. All I can say is wow!,nan,1,ex3923
expedia,The rooms were very clean although they seemed to be somewhat dated (the carpet was showing wear). Staff was pleasant. Breakfast was good. There was always quite a wait for service in the bar and we were disappointed that there were no in room movies to watch.,nan,1,ex3924
expedia,Staff was very gracious. Room was lovely. Would definitely come back.,nan,1,ex3925
expedia,"Overall my stay was pleasant. The hotel looked very elegant, renovated and nice. I can't give 5 stars because my husband and I ordered room service on our first night, and it was just horrible. We ordered wings, gumbo, and s'mores. All 3 dishes were absolutely disgusting. They gave us 6 small buffalo wings, which were all dry and gross. The salty gumbo came with a spoonful of rice.... smaller than a child's serving...actually, smaller than a baby's serving. And the dessert, the ""s'mores"" came frozen with rock hard graham crackers. We spent nearly a benjamin for service that included 6 wings, salty gumbo with a dab of rice, and frozen/thawing s'mores. The hotel has nice staff and like I said before... it was clean and elegant... but I can't get the room service incident out of my mind.",nan,1,ex3926
expedia,Good value for the location. Staff friendly. No complaints here.,nan,1,ex3927
expedia,Wasn't impressed with room. Matt (pink Floyd) at front desk was awesome!,nan,1,ex3928
expedia,Great stay! Really cool room. The staff was friendly and helpful.,nan,1,ex3929
expedia,Very pleasant experience. The staff were very friendly and helpful.,nan,1,ex3930
expedia,"Very good. Concierge was great, desk personnel...there is room to improve. Chucks, food was yummy! Service a bit slow, but over all our experience was great.",nan,1,ex3931
expedia,"Perfect location in the middle of everything, and the staff were fabulous, especially the concierge. No matter how many times we came down to them with questions they always had an answer and a smile ready for us. The only issue was the shower which made terrifying angry noises if you turned up the hot water too fast (or at all), but the hot water still worked so other than the scary noises it was fine. Good hotel, loved it",nan,1,ex3932
expedia,"I recently stayed 4 nights at the Hard Rock Hotel, in Chicago. When I walked into my room, I was blown away. I stayed in room 2204, and it was amazing. Due to a bit of noise from the pipes (completely our of the hotels control), I was moved (reluctantly, because I loved my room). But then I went to 3101, and WOW again. The views, the feel of the rooms, and the sizes in both were simply great. As luck would have it, there was a small issue with the tub (did I mention there was a shower AND a tub in the suite? Pretty Nice.) The Hard Rock did everything they could to fix it, but they ultimately needed better access. Now, I'm pretty easy going, they could have moved me back to the first room and I would have been pleased. BUT NO. They UPGRADED me a SECOND time. I was moved to room 3502, which had a clear view of the river, TWO bathrooms, a living room, OH AND A POOL TABLE & PAC MAN MACHINE. Needless to say, overall, I'm equally impressed and awed with their facilities as I am with their customer service. I'll be returning again.",nan,1,ex3933
expedia,"We checked in Friday at 1PM and they had both of our rooms ready. We used the valet, and aside from a little google maps GPS trouble it was pretty easy to find! The valet was awesome, even ran to my car to grab my contacts box when I got to the room and realized I forgot it! The front desk staff was fantastic! Greeted our group with smiles even though we had Packer gear on for the draft. The gentleman that took all of our luggage up to our room came in and hung everything up and put our bags on fold out shelves (got a nice little tip for that!). Both rooms we got were very clean and in great condition. The water pressure was phenomenal. The only thing that was wrong was the toilet ran, but it wasn't too bad considering we basically got the rooms just to sleep! Overall I will definitely be back when I come to Chicago in August. I can't wait!",nan,1,ex3934
expedia,Old dirty hotel. My allergies were off the chart. There was an old rotten bottle of milk in the refrigerator. There was dirt in the corners and behind the doors. hotel in bad need of updates,nan,1,ex3935
expedia,"I was not very impressed with the hotel or the staff. They did not seem friendly & when I asked them several questions it was quick short answers (there was no other hotel guests around or waiting to be helped). It was too dark in the hallways for us to see the room numbers clearly without getting up close to the doors. They did not ask how my stay was when I checked out. The refrigerator was stocked full of items & if you moved any of the items you were automatically charged, I had brought my own water with me. If you did not use the item, you had to go down to have them remove the charge.",nan,1,ex3936
expedia,Rattling pipes through out the night.. Loose floor tiles in shower and bathroom floor.. I could not get no sleep,nan,1,ex3937

expedia,"several noises on the room didn't let me sleep well so, i give them a 5 out of 10",nan,1,ex3939
expedia,Large outdated grey rooms without any charm. Poor service for the astronomic prices they charge. The room service is a disaster. Nobody answer the phone to take your order. Poor service for breakfast. I was waiting for long time to be attended. The food is horrible. The only positive point is the location.,nan,1,ex3940
expedia,We spent three nights at Hard Rock. We wanted to be close to the Symphony. Car park cost $65 per night! WOW!! The staff seemed to be indifferent. The room needed a real cleaning. The mattress on the bed was falling apart. It dipped in the middle. The stuffing was coming out. I was glad when it was time to move on.,nan,1,ex3941
expedia,"Stayed for three nights this week, and I had a pretty good experience. The first night was unusually noisy (inside and out), so I had a tough time getting any decent sleep. The next two nights were much better, for some reason. The front desk staff is very helpful, and the maids did a great job of cleaning the rooms promptly and thoroughly. Prices seem a little high for what you get, because the rooms are not really out of the ordinary. I have stayed at several different places across Chicago, and this one is probably not in my top three. Still, the location is great, the rooms are clean, and the staff is friendly, so don't count them out if you get a chance to visit.",nan,1,ex3942
expedia,"Hard Rock Hotel is close to Subway and good dining. Giordano's and Billy Goat Tavern nearby. Save, and good location.",nan,1,ex3943
expedia,Was disappointed there wasn't a Hard Rock Cafe inside the hotel.,nan,1,ex3944
expedia,"Stayed at Hard Rock Hotel, and staff could not have been more accommodating. We arrived early and needed you luggage held when leaving, they took very good care of us. I will be staying here again next time I visit Chicago. Room was very clean and comfortable. Loved the Rock n Roll themed items throughout the hotel.",nan,1,ex3945
expedia,"First room was way two small, parking was crazy expensive. Got moved up to a larger room due to helpful accommodating staff.",nan,1,ex3946
expedia,"We came from St Louis for the weekend to see a show on the Near South Side. Although this hotel was more expensive than others closer to the venue, the extra price was well worth it. The area was clean, safe, and well-lit. We parked in a nearby parking garage and walked to the hotel late at night (midnight) with no worries. A CVS Pharmacy and Pop Mart within a few block radius made picking up any incidentals cheap and easy. The hotel had tons of amenities, such as valet parking and its own parking garage (with in and out privileges, but was also within walking distance from public transportation and other garages. The staff was friendly and helpful, the rooms clean and included extras (mini fridge, iron and ironing board, plus others upon request). Many attractions within easy walking distance, and others accessible through public transportation (also within walking distance). The area around the hotel is clean and safe--we had no concerns regarding walking from a nearby garage to the hotel late at night.",nan,1,ex3947
expedia,"Our stay at the Hard Rock was great. The room was modern, clean, and comfortable, however; it was in need of some repairs (loose bathroom tiles, drafty windows, etc). The hotel is in a very convenient location and is close to many great restaurants and stores. The staff was extremely friendly and helpful!",nan,1,ex3948
expedia,"While this Hard Rock Hotel was great location, great price, you need to keep in mind about other things not included. Parking is a main thing if you drove. The hotel rents out fridge and wireless access is not free unless you purchased it as part of your room reservation. Overall, it's a nice place to stay.",nan,1,ex3949
expedia,The overall stay was great. The only concern was the bed mattress was a bit to firm for me. The pillows were to soft.,nan,1,ex3950
expedia,"Giordanos pizza, sweetwater tavern and Garrett's are right across the street. Several other food places and convenient stores are there as well. We walked to Millennium Park, Sheds Aquarium, and the Field Museum. Our room was clean and the staff was very nice. I would recommend buying your own parking from one of the nearby parking garages as we found 65 a night a bit on the high side. That being said, we would definitely stay here again.",nan,1,ex3951

expedia,"En el sitio perfecto para poder ver las zonas importantes de chicago, muy limpio comodo y muy buen servicio",nan,1,ex3953
expedia,The staff were very helpful; the room was clean and quiet. Our only problem was with a clogged toilet. It took two tries to get someone to fix it. . . two early morning calls. At check-out there were two incorrect items on our bill: one for overnight parking (we had arrived by train/taxi) and one for items from the snack tray (we didn't use anything). They were corrected . . .but still. Isn't this an old trick?,nan,1,ex3954
expedia,Only bad thing was couldnt adjust temperature. Was located close to all points we wanted to visit.,nan,1,ex3955
expedia,The hotel was nice. We reserved a city view room but the view wasn't as city as we expected. We were on the 12th floor but we didn't really get to see much of the city. The room was quite warm and we tried to get it to cool down but the fan wasn't working.,nan,1,ex3956
expedia,"Hotel room temp could not be regulated, bathroom had hair on the floor before we moved a thing into it. We reserved the hotel with (5) known guests in the room. You would think there would be 5 towels and 5 places to sleep but there was not. Had to ask for both.",nan,1,ex3957
expedia,"The staff was very nice and friendly. ..they made the stay for me and my 16 year old daughter very enjoyable. Restaurant was nice too. Drinks at the nearby bar were very pricey, however, so I'd recommend another watering hole if you were so inclined.",nan,1,ex3958
expedia,First we were given a room that was already occupied. Our second room developed a leak while we were at dinner. The third room was good. The elevators are irregular and slow enough to make you late.,nan,1,ex3959
expedia,Good location. Good price through Expedia. In room Internet not available to Expedia customers. TV Cable was slow (audio and video did not align). Shampoo was used. They leave ads on your phone in the middle of the night. Very friendly staff though.,nan,1,ex3960
expedia,"Super nice staff, clean room enjoyed the entire experience",nan,1,ex3961
expedia,The husband and I enjoyed a romantic getaway is Chicago.,nan,1,ex3962
expedia,"all in all, the HRH is just what the doctor ordered for our stay in chicago. we wanted central location and the HRH is perfect! The bell staff was helpful and friendly. the front desk staff- not so much!",nan,1,ex3963
expedia,"I booked a room with a ""city veiw."" My city view was the top of a lower roof and the side of another building, nothing else could be seen. The hotel staff was very accomidating and switched me to a different room. When we got to that room it was evident that someone had been smoking in it. Again, the hotel staff was concerned and told me they would try to do something about it. Another thing was that my entire floor smelled like smoke when we came back at the end of the day. When I called the hotel staff they actually sent someone up to our floor to investigate and knocking on doors to find out who was smoking in their room so THANK YOU for that. I was impressed! After that I never smelled smoke the whole time we were there.",nan,1,ex3964
expedia,"Great check-in to start with. Loved the location of our room, very comfortable and I will say the best bed I have slept in for a hotel!",nan,1,ex3965
expedia,I love the hotel clean nice staff was good restaurant I'm good condition I will defnetly recomemd it very good location close to everything Michigan street is the street you want be on when you visit chicago,nan,1,ex3966
expedia,"I've probably spent around two months all told at the Hard Rock Chicago over the last year-and-a-half. My experience has been consistently very good, and the location is excellent.",nan,1,ex3967
expedia,Also paid $120 in parking to wait 25 minutes for my car. They said it was on its way and I watched people check out before me have their cars. I tipped very well every time and don't expect better service but when told my car wld be there 15 mins I expected it sooner and before people that checked out after me. My husband and i were the last ones standing in the cold. Believe me the valet guy that brought my car didn't suffer but I will no longer stay there.,nan,1,ex3968
expedia,"Will not stay at a Hard Rock Hotel again. Felt its ridiculous to be charged additional parking fee(an extremely high amount) on top of room charges. Parking should come with the establishment u are staying at, not be an additional fee.",nan,1,ex3969
expedia,"Personnell was professional and courteous although room condition was marginal...ripped curtains, stains on curtains and walls.",nan,1,ex3970
expedia,Hotel was fine. Valet parking was not very timely. We waited about 45 minutes to get our car when trying to leave. We called and were told it would be 10-15 minutes and ended up being 45 minutes.,nan,1,ex3971
expedia,No insulation...could hear everything in the hallway.,nan,1,ex3972
expedia,"I've stayed at 8 or more 4 star hotels in downtown Chicago and quite honestly many are a tad over rated. The Hard Rock was nice but it started out a little rough. I booked a King Tower room which is supposed to be a bi-level room with a king size bed. Well when I opened the door I was greeted by a full size bed that was less than 2ft away, next to the bed were 3 steps that led down into a sitting area with a couch and table. A horribly designed matchbox of a room. The view wasn't at all worth that struggle and the nice front desk hosts were all smiles when assuring me I'd love it. I didn't love and fortunately they quickly sent up keys to another room. Beware of the 36th floor. I was moved to the 14the floor in a standard room with a king bed and that was just fine. Of course no adjustment to my bill, like I don't know that the room I booked costs more.The bathrooms are quite nice though and the hotel bar and restaurant LOOKED nice.",nan,1,ex3973
expedia,"The staff was terrific from the parking attendants to the front desk staff, to the wait staff in Chuck's. Thoroughly enjoyed our stay.",nan,1,ex3974
expedia,In Chicago for a national conference with great location and amenities.,nan,1,ex3975
expedia,"We strayed here for a date night. The hotel was gorgeous, the staff was great, and the location was amazing!!",nan,1,ex3976
expedia,"This was my first time staying at The Hard Rock Hotel and I absolutely LOVED it !! The room was a great size with an awesome bathroom. The hotel was clean and not filled with rowdy guest. The concierge gave great directions to local eateries and shopping locations. Beware of the extra $50 charge after your check out. The extra charge is dropped after 3-5 business days but, I'm just giving a heads up. Parking is another story. Chicago has horrible parking options. We parked in a parking garage behind the hotel and the cost was $42 a day !!! *Thumbs down* but, it is better than paying $60 for the hotel valet. Overall, this is a great hotel. I would definitely stay again only in another city with better parking. lol",nan,1,ex3977
expedia,"The hotel is soo old and there are a lot of noises. Also, there is a construction site right next to the hotel so sleeping was almost impossible for me and I was in the 25th floor. Basically, I will not stay at this hotel next time. Otherwise everything was great",nan,1,ex3978
expedia,Drapes were shredding/torn needs a little attention but was pleasant and great value. A lot of construction so noisy in am,nan,1,ex3979
expedia,A great 4 nights in Chicago. All was fantastic... especially Kyle working at Chuck's and the housekeeping service was awesome.,nan,1,ex3980
expedia,"My husband and I stayed here on a little getaway. The Hotel staff were very friendly, helpful, and courteous. The bartender and waitress in the restaurant were especially nice! The room was large, bed was very comfy, temperature was good, and room and bathroom were spotless! The entire facility seemed very clean. We were on the 23rd floor, and the street noise in the morning was the only complaint I have. We were within walking distance of the Milennium Park, shopping on the Magnificent Mile, and the Theater District. We walked to all of these places/areas with ease. We will definitely go back, but may try for a room on a higher floor.",nan,1,ex3981
expedia,"Hotel is ok. Almost everything in the room had an issue--bulbs burnt out, coffee maker broken, curtains would not close, toilet would not flush, mini bar never restocked. I reported each one of these issues and no one responded--nothing fixed. To top it off, I was seriously ill the last night--with a faulty toilet--and had to stay an extra night. It cost me almost the same for one more night than the entire three I had already paid for. I did not expect to get a night free, but felt taken advantage of. I could not sit up without getting ill so had no hope of checking out on time. I realize rates change, but that was ridiculous--have a little compassion. One dicounted night is not going to bankrupt an international hotel chain. But it does make for a bad review. Could be praising their consideration right now.",nan,1,ex3982
expedia,"This was an awesome hotel. It was so close to everything, so nice and clean and updated! The staff was very friendly and helpful. Chucks was a great place to eat! The only downside was that we couldn't adjust the room temperature so it was a little warm for us. But all in all it was a great hotel that I will definitely stay at again!",nan,1,ex3983
expedia,"I had one night in the hotel and arrived for check in around 11am in case a room happened to be available. There was, and the friendly front desk agent upgraded my room with no extra charge. He placed me in a corner room on the 7th floor that had fantastic views!! I LOVED the layout, the room was spacious, and the sizes of the windows/openness of the room only enhanced the ""big city"" feel. I left the blinds open all night for the full effect, and if there was noise due to Michigan Avenue below, it didn't bother me at all. The concierge also was super helpful. Perk: there's a ping pong table in the lobby.",nan,1,ex3984
expedia,"Stayed on the 33rd floor in the tower suites, had great views up and down Michigan Ave, and also the lake. Had dinner at Chuck's, the food was awesome. Close to public transportation, so you could get around the city pretty fast.",nan,1,ex3985
expedia,"nice clean rocking hotel with friendly staff and close to shops and a lot of things to do in the heart of Chicago its also one of the most interesting buildings in Chicago it has a plaque outside to prove it. it has great light airy rooms with mega comfy beds, I would have no problem recommending this hotel to anyone.",nan,1,ex3986
expedia,"The room was nice with a great view of Michigan Ave. The staff, from the door man, to the front desk, to the maid were all genuinely warm and welcoming.",nan,1,ex3987

expedia,Perfect stay. This place is all about pleasure. The staff is awesome.,nan,1,ex3989
expedia,"Visited same hotel last year, Great staff, reasonable hotel.",nan,1,ex3990
expedia,"The hotel location can't be beat, but we paid for it in discomfort. We expected city noise and live music noise, which was actually not too bad. The window was either not insulated or the seal was broken because our window covering blew in like the window was open and it was just as cold as if it had been. This may have been correctable if the thermostat worked properly, but the sensor must have been in an odd location because I'd set it at 72 and if felt like 62, but the thermostat said it was 80. The toilet wouldn't flush unless you held the handle down for quite awhile and it was very noisy for a long period after. The worse part was despite the room not being very warm it was so incredibly dry it woke me up at night.",nan,1,ex3991
expedia,"This hotel was a very good value at a very convenient location to the Chicago Loop. The restaurant was excellent with a rather varied and unusual menu. A very nice change from the ""normal"" business hotel. The decor is ""Hard Rock"" motif and includes Fender guitars that you can check-out (like a lending library) and play in your room [BYOA = Bring your own amplifier]. The only unpleasant part of the stay was housekeeping beating on my door in the morning while I was sleeping.",nan,1,ex3992
expedia,"The biggest problem we had was when we first entered the room. The temperature was ungodly warm. We immediately turned down the thermostat and called the front desk. The front desk agent put us on hold. Whenshe reurned to the phone, she told us she had consulted the engineer who wanted us to open the window! First of all, it's very unusual to have windows that can open in a skyscraper. Second, it was not clear how to open them (couldn't they have come upstairs and done that for us?). Third, I had to move furniture to get to the window. Fourth, it was very difficult to get it open even a crack. Nevertheless, I thought we'd give it a try. We then went to the fitness room (very nice) for an hour. Upon our return we found half of the room very cold and the other half still hot. We called again, and this time we got the response we should have in the first place: they put us in a different room. The new room was great and the rest of the stay went as planned. First staff interaction: 1 star; second staff interaction: 5 stars.",nan,1,ex3993
expedia,Stay was great. Love the rock & roll vibe the hotel has and the wonderful amenities. We also had a great view of the city! Loved it. Would definitely stay here again!,nan,1,ex3994
expedia,"Needs better lighting in room, no vending machines.",nan,1,ex3995
expedia,"The check in process was very quick and I was in my room within 10 minutes. The room was very clean and comfortable. However, there were a few little holes in the wall next to the TV. The mirror on the closet door also had a large dent in it. The only thing that I was very unhappy with was having a house keeper walk into my room thinking no one was in it while I was there, and coincidentally had just gotten out of the shower. Not a very nice surprise!",nan,1,ex3996
expedia,"This was a nice hotel the only problem is that there's extra charges for everything. We didn't even get a refrigerator or an microwave. I went in with high expectations for Hard Rock Hotel is very well known. I also visited the cafe, for me staying at the hotel I would expect some kind of discount but nothing, we didn't even have transportation to the restaurant",nan,1,ex3997
expedia,"First, before I say anything, I want to say how awesome the staff is at the Hard Rock. If the place did anything right it was the staff, that's for sure. But, for us, that's about as far as the good reviews go. So. Where to begin? Three o'clock rolls around and we decide to head to our hotel and check in. Putting the address to our GPS, we head that way and let me tell you... This hotel is horrendous to find! Though, surely not up to the hotel, the front street of the hotel was under construction. Now, we know this hotel has no say in the city streets but it would have been nice to know ahead of time. We got lost for over an hour. So, finally we find the place, and try to park. Not finding anything we call the hotel and ask for a suggestion. They tell us that the only parking the hotel ""supplies"" is a $60/day(?) valet with in and out privileges. Youch. That hurt. So we bite the bullet and give the car over to the valet then head inside. The staff was so friendly- I can't say that enough. We checked in quickly and then went to find our room. We push the elevator button and take the first one that comes open and try and press our floor number. The elevator zoomed all the way up to the 31st floor and we had a mini panic attack thinking, ""oh no! This things broken!"" Then, thankfully another staff member comes aboard our mini panic party and informs us that these certain elevators take us to certain floors. So we rode back down to the lobby and take our specific elevator to",nan,1,ex3998
expedia,The room had an unpleasant smell but seemed clean. The bed was comfortable and the room was spacious. All of the staff we encountered were friendly and helpful. The fitness room was very nice with a good variety of equipment. A few machines were not working though and we did have an issue with the elevator. We had to figure out where the stairs were without any signs or anyone around to help. I tried the phone that was down there to call the desk but that wasn't working either.,nan,1,ex3999
expedia,Great location in the Loop area. Clean. Great experience.,nan,1,ex4000
expedia,The hotel was great. Sadly parking is valet only and seriously expensive b,nan,1,ex4001
expedia,the workers were nice but the hotel wasn't all that the website said it to be then we arrived we were forced to pay for valet parking that we were not told about ahead of time.,nan,1,ex4002
expedia,Excellent - very nice staff and accommodating.,nan,1,ex4003
expedia,"Had a wonderful Valentine's weekend, the hotel was amazing, the resturant down stairs was great..wouldn't stay anywhere else in Chicago. The view was breath taking. This is coming from someone who travels a ton. Great hotel",nan,1,ex4004

expedia,It was good Put an itinerary of the bar music scene in the rooms and or lobby. Why do I have to ask 20 questions to the bar tender? Room was fun. Led Zepp. Great deal at $99 per night in the loop. Any classic rock ever or just Hip Hop. I know. I know. You gotta make $$$,nan,1,ex4010

expedia,"Great Location, central to most downtown attractions and dining. Hotel staff, while nice were a little unprofessional in behavior, language, shouting, goofing off. Room was OK, showed signs of wear and tear, but generally nice. WOuld stay there again, but expected a bit more consiering price and Hard Rock brand image. Thier valetparking was $60 per day and nearby self parking was about $40 per day, so factor this into overall costs.",nan,1,ex4012

expedia,"Pillows smelled like body odor, bathroom was dirty (tub & tiles) Coffee pot did not work and when asked to please replace, we were treated like we were idiot's and did not know how to work it.

expedia,The Hard Rock was great! Edgy and super stylish but still comfortable! Only downside was parking. EXPENSIVE!!,nan,1,ex4016
expedia,"Quick trip for family. Stayed Saturday night. Helpful staff and concierge when I left my toiletry bag. Chucks restaurant sufficed for adult beverages. $60 valet seemed a bit excessive but so be it. Clean comfortable rooms, theme wasn't oberbearing or too gimmicky. I'd recommend or stay again, especially for the price.",nan,1,ex4017
expedia,"The Hard Rock is a nice hotel and convenient to much of what downtown has to offer. The rooms are beginning to show a little wear and tear--the lampshade was stained, and the linens were worn a little thin.

expedia,"The stay was great,but i feel like they downgraded my room from the city view room to a regular king room.It wasn't my fault that the room had gnats in the bathroom when we checked in.",nan,1,ex4060
expedia,Beautiful location in the heart of the city in a beautiful art Deco building. Clean with a great vibe!,nan,1,ex4061
expedia,Perfect Location and awesome service! Loved it.,nan,1,ex4062
expedia,Love it,nan,1,ex4063
expedia,"Awesome hotel in an awesome location. The only complaint I Have is that they had the ""indulgence bar"" (aka expensive food/drink in room) on a plate that charged you if the items were moved even slightly. Also, we couldn't use the fridge due to the same reason. It got to the point where I was afraid to touch anything for fear of being billed for it. Other than that, the hotel was really nice and the service was exceptional!",nan,1,ex4064
expedia,"The cost of the room was reasonable for downtown Chicago, however the additional $60 parking fee was not disclosed up front and was automatically charged to the room. This made the price of the room jump from $130 a night to $190 a night. Well above other ones in the area. They did not provide the amenities that are standard for lesser cost hotel chains such as a fridge, microwave or other minor necessities. They did not provide any outside vending, so if you wanted something you have to pay in the room at the motion sensitive bar fridge or go outside the hotel. Overall, I would not recommend this as a place to stay if you want basic comforts. It was overly expensive with the undisclosed parking fee but adequate if you only needed a place to rest your head.",nan,1,ex4065
expedia,"We checked into a room on the 4th floor and had an issue with the laundry shoot disturbing us and the view was less than desirable, so we asked to be moved. The hotel staff were more than willing to make the change. Our view on the 31st floor of the tower was breathtaking during the day and more so, at night! We would stay here again, any time!",nan,1,ex4066
expedia,quick post xmas holiday weekend in the city : ) Perfect spot close to everything river north despite being just south!,nan,1,ex4067
expedia,Nice,nan,1,ex4068
expedia,"So,we booked the room for New Year's Eve so it was really busy in the hotel because they were having a party as well. The atmosphere was great!! It truly is a youthful modernized hotel. The room was smaller than I expected but very gorgeous and comfortable. My only complaints or more so dislike is that the lighting in the whole room was very dim. Me and my cousins were getting ready and doing hair and makeup and it just felt like the bathroom was not well lit. I know, I know that's really not that important, but when you need more light, you need light! My favorite part of the room was the bed! So comfortable! And the decor is very unique and Rock N'roll I inspired of course, very cool. I definitely would stay again.",nan,1,ex4069
expedia,My room was very bland and boring. Nothing special. After looking at pictures and seeing reviews I was very excited to stay at this nice hotel but when I arrived it was not what I expected at all. The staff was friendly but even when I offered to pay for an upgrade to have a nice room they didn't have anything. My room was no better then an average hotel just more costly. I will not be going back!,nan,1,ex4070
expedia,Not up to date bug n bathroom not comfy,nan,1,ex4071
expedia,This was a very nice hotel. We were able to walk most everywhere even museums. Clean friendly. Only complaint would be the restaurant Chucks. Had breakfast there last morning and it was terrible.,nan,1,ex4072
expedia,"Booked my hotel through Expedia, so room was pre-paid. When my hotel stay was done, Hard Rock debited my account, then credited it back again for an amount that I had no idea what it was for. Again today, 5 days after my stay, Hard Rock is again debiting my account for what reason, I have no idea. Person I spoke with on the phone, just said that they debit our account on check-in. Two times? How many times do you need to debit my account?Would never stay here again. Not because of the hotel or room, but because this crazy accounting practice.",nan,1,ex4073
expedia,Have stayed at the Hard Rock several times since it opened. Seems to be getting a little worn and could use a little bit of an upgrade. Overall Great Stay and Good experience with staff and services.,nan,1,ex4074
expedia,"We had a breathtaking view from our mini suite on the 33 rd floor. I always request a city view here. It is magnificent, as is the location, walking distance to everything. We will definitely stay here again.",nan,1,ex4075
expedia,"Sadly, this is not the Hard Rock that we have come to love. Being our 6th stay in 4 years, we can see some disappointing changes. Or lack thereof. I will warn Expedia members, if you book here, they really don't care much for your business. In fact when I mentioned my dissatisfaction to the lady at the front desk she said ""I am sorry sir, but you booked through a third party, so there really isn't much more I can do."" The issues I had this time were: The shampoo in the shower was half full and had obviously been used by the previous guest. The bathroom floor tiles were loose and the grout missing. The beds were poorly made and the fitted sheets, didn't fit. The room was not very clean. Smudges on the walls of the shower. Fingerprints on the mirror, empty minibar. None of these are really ""big deals"" but put together, i felt I needed to say something. I was sad with the response. We still love the location, and the feel of the Hard Rock, but it keeps slipping, and I am thinking our next visit to the Windy City may include a change of venue. We may give it one more shot...but it is debatable.",nan,1,ex4076
expedia,"would have liked a contintal breakfast, room was not as quite as i would have liked.",nan,1,ex4077
expedia,"Hotel is in a great location, right on Michigan ave, recommend getting the rooms with a view of Michigan ave. Would stay again! Friendly staff that were helpful Downside Near the fire station and you hear all of the alarms. Hot water only Luke warm on Sunday checkout. Lastly our room was missing pictures off the wall :(",nan,1,ex4078
expedia,"Short walk from hotel to parks, lake and downtown shopping",nan,1,ex4079
expedia,Nice hotel but woke up early Sunday by the noise of construction that was next door off the hotel.,nan,1,ex4080
expedia,The check on process was very quick and the staff were friendly. Room was small but very clean.,nan,1,ex4081
expedia,"Family weekend downtown for shopping and dinner. The hotel location is great, the decor is very cool, but the room quality was not that great. The service was great at times and mediocre at times. Considering the choices in downtown Chicago, I would probably not stay there again.",nan,1,ex4082
expedia,Good service. Great vacation place. Definitely going to come back.,nan,1,ex4083
expedia,"I have read other reviews that complain about the staff but that was not my experience. They were all very friendly even when we randomly ran into them in the halls. The room was a little cold when we got in (66F), but we just turned up the thermostat and then it was comfortable. The view from the hotel was fantastic. I would definitely stay here again. Plus the hotel looks very nice and was clean. They also have a restaurant and lounge where they have a DJ playing. We didn't stop by there though so I don't know the quality of the music.",nan,1,ex4084
expedia,The stay were nice. I just didn't like the idea of them switching my king city view room to a regular king room.,nan,1,ex4085
expedia,I was in Chicago for a business meeting. Enjoy stay at different hotels and enjoy my stay with you.,nan,1,ex4086
expedia,A fine hotel at the corner of Michigan Ave and Wacker Dr. It is the closest hotel to the Brazilian Councel where you need to go to apply for visas.,nan,1,ex4087
expedia,"We stayed overnight on a Saturday. During the night or very early morning, I thought I heard vacuum cleaners running in other rooms. How early do they clean rooms at this hotel? On Sunday morning, we decided to have our bags stored downstairs with the valet while, instead of putting them in our car. I'm 99% sure my expensive bottle of Argon oil fell out of the side pocket of my backpack, along with a bottle of saline solution for my contacts & a phone charger. I called the hotel, spoke to valet & room service & there was no sign of any of these items. Strange.",nan,1,ex4088
expedia,Great location. Gorgeous Art Deco lobby. Good gym. Nice bars/restaurant. Dirty hallways. Totally unreliable room service. Front desk staff not empathetic/concerned about that.,nan,1,ex4089
expedia,The hotel was fine. Clean. Cool rooms. The hallway noise was way too loud inside room. Also the parking is a letdown. I won't go back there if I drive. The hotel should compensate for parking.,nan,1,ex4090
expedia,"Quick overnight stay/getaway for a romantic weekend. Easy check in. Unique hotel, nice amenities. Generous room size for a standard king room. Hard Rock is either walking distance to bars, shopping, restaurants or a quick cab ride away. Valet parking available with in and out privileges. I would stay here again.",nan,1,ex4091
expedia,Hotel was clean and staff was friendly. Nice finishes all around.,nan,1,ex4092
expedia,"I stayed for one night on business travel. I was pleased with the location, service and room. The hotel staff was friendly and helpful. The valet was super responsive. The room was clean and the bed was comfortable. It wasn't overly luxurious (fairly simple design) but it was better than most. If I had to nitpick I could say that the bathroom could be re-grouted but honestly, what does that matter? (I'm remodeling my bathroom or Id have never noticed!)",nan,1,ex4093
expedia,"C grade. It's just ""ok"". Decorations are tired and need updating. But the carpet is cool and seems new. Lighting in room (and bathroom) is horrible, windows drafty, awkward closet but bed was comfortable. Bar was quaint...slow on Friday night but hopping when we returned on Saturday. Packed with almost all AA crowd with DJ. I'd recommend the hotel if you get a good deal. Great location in a historical building. I previously lived in downtown Chicago (River North) for 7 years, so I know the city well.",nan,1,ex4094
expedia,"We were in and out in a flash weekend. The bar special was fabulous! The photo booth didn't have instructions posted, so we wasted a little time and money. Concierge was helpful, bellmen were courteous. Front desk staff was polite and efficient. Valet guys were great. Housekeeping was thorough. Room service was slow, but not terribly. Mini bar is unnecessary these days. We followed the ""save towels"" instructions, but all towels were taken. Not a big deal, for sure. But if you're offering the green option, you should follow through. Location is prime. Very pleasant experience!",nan,1,ex4095
expedia,"My glasses were stolen out of my car When using the closest parking garage, I guess I should of used the hotels. P.s. Dont talk to the bums they will just hustle you trust me!",nan,1,ex4096
expedia,"Really nice hotel BUT kinda overrated price wise and Wi-Fi wasn't working.Close to everything and Illinois Center was close for good eats of all kinds. Overnight parking was quite expensive as well. But, we enjoyed our stay and the hotel staff.",nan,1,ex4097
expedia,"Would be nice if there was a casual menu at the restaurant, as we only wanted something simple but spent good money. Overall very good though.",nan,1,ex4098
expedia,It was ok. Room was small but nice. Water pressure in shower was weak. It's a nice no frills hotel.,nan,1,ex4099
expedia,They upgraded me for free. Perfect large corner room. So comfortable and a definite plus for my business stay,nan,1,ex4100
expedia,reserved the room ahead of time on my credit card. call the day before arrival I was told I could pay with cash so when we arrive we were told there was a $300 deposit required when paying with cash nobody told me that priorwe would receive the $300 back at the end of our stay.but we were using some of that 300 dollars for our weekend money. Nobody told us they require $60 per night for parking. no frigerator for our own cold drinks no microwave to heat up any leftovers. really not impressed with our stay,nan,1,ex4101
expedia,We arrived early so our room was not quite ready. We went for a walk and to have lunch. When we returned because the room was still not ready they upgraded us to a very nice room suite.,nan,1,ex4102
expedia,The location is fantastic! Staff was friendly and such a cool hotel for those of us who love classic rock. Each floor is themed for a rock star and there was a copy of Rolling Stone waiting for us in the room as well as a nice sounding iPod dock to play music. The room could have used a bit more lightning but we thoroughly enjoyed our stay here :),nan,1,ex4103
expedia,"I stayed at this hotel for a business trip. All I was expecting was a clean place to sleep. The hotel website made the hotel appear spacious, even boasts about the size of the rooms. They are actually small to average at best. The furniture is tired and worn. I was o.k. with that but thought I paid more than this hotel was worth and next time will not pick this hotel. The room seemed clean, except for some mold in the shower. The beds were comfortable, but sleeping was difficult with cars honking and sirens going all night and into the morning. I stayed on the 17th floor. I can't even imagine how bad it must be on lower levels. I have been to Chcago numerous times and have never had the street noise effect my sleep. I'm not sure if it's the position of the buildings or what, but it was really bad every night.",nan,1,ex4104
expedia,Enjoyed our stay,nan,1,ex4105
expedia,Good location right off of Michigan ave. close to shopping and food. Bed was comfy. Shower pressure was bad. Construction going on right next door was loud. Nice gym.,nan,1,ex4106
expedia,"Great location, cool hotel, staff was awesome and friendly. I'd definitely stay there again and recommend it to others.",nan,1,ex4107
expedia,"We stayed at the Hard Rock for one night on November 8th. Check-in was a breeze and only took about 2 minutes. The front desk staff greeted us by name and were very friendly. They told us there had been a Red Bull conference in the hotel and offered us each complimentary Red Bull drinks. We had a room with a king size bed. We wound up with a corner room, which was great because it had windows on two walls. The windows overlooked the Chicago River and Michigan Ave. It was a great feature. The room was clean and the bathroom was large and clean as well. The location of the hotel was great too because we felt it was right in the middle of everything. We were able to walk everywhere we wanted to go. Overall, this was a very nice hotel for the price we paid and wouldn't hesitate to stay here again.",nan,1,ex4108
expedia,"I loved the location and how convenient it was to almost everywhere I wanted to visit in Chicago. The staff was incredibly friendly! The food in the hotel restaurant was FABULOUS! In two days, I ate at the restaurant at least four times. I had an amazing visit and cannot wait to return!",nan,1,ex4109
expedia,The room and staff were nice. Most extras like breakfast and wifi in the room have additional fees. Also the king size bed is more like a small queen. But it was a good deal overall.,nan,1,ex4110
expedia,Great customer service. Awesome atmosphere and really great location for travelers.,nan,1,ex4111
expedia,"I have never been in a hotel that had a fridge in it and not been able to use it without paying for what's in it that you don't want. Would have liked to have put my own pop and water in it. I also thought that paying the price for the room I should not have to pay 60.00 to valet my car at their hotel.. Sounds a little outrages to me. Also I had thought if you stay at the hard rock hotel the Hard Rock Cafe should be either in it or next to it , not 2 or 3 blocks away. Staying in downtown Chicago is very expensive and not very middle class friendly. I don't think I will go back, and didn't have time to see what I wanted to.",nan,1,ex4112
expedia,No complaints! There was an issue getting our room keys activated so for the wait they gave us a free round of drinks at the bar. Such good service! The room was beautiful and the floor was completely silent. For a weekend stay it felt like we had the whole place to ourselves!,nan,1,ex4113
expedia,Excellent view form our 33rd floor north west corner. Very good breakfast both in room and restaurant. We will be back....,nan,1,ex4114
expedia,Paying extra for Internet in 2014 ?? False Internet price on a room that's a few dollars under $300 for a Saturday night with tax . Then charge for Internet-. Hots in 3rd world countries don't charge for Internet. A Hotel on Michigan Ave needs to ?,nan,1,ex4115
expedia,"great location, very nice hotel rooms. large rooms for right in downtown at this price. you can walk everywhere and just a few blocks from the train which you can get to the airport for $3 instead of a large taxi bill.",nan,1,ex4116
expedia,"Lighting was bad in the room. Earphones went missing and there was nothing to the hotel would do about it, beyond an ""investigation"" (i.e. NO REFUND). Cell phone internet connection unavailable my entire stay. Major, major let down.",nan,1,ex4117
expedia,"Was given a spacious room with a great view. Bathroom surfaces need a little refreshing. Eager, young, professional staff. Close to both Millenium Park and Wacker Drive. A little pricey.",nan,1,ex4118
expedia,Not worth price for room. It's too noisy. Very expensive to park.,nan,1,ex4119
expedia,Great staff. They let us check in early at 10:00 am with not extra fee! Awesome location!,nan,1,ex4120
expedia,"Everything was fine - except for outrageous WiFi charges for terrible spotty service. As a business traveler, I need reliable service and usually stay at hotels that provide the service without a charge. This was a charge per device - per day and I was double charged. The desk clerk did not respond courteously and seemed indifferent to my concerns.",nan,1,ex4121
expedia,"Comfortable rooms, great location, close to many things, we got a great rate on expedia, would recommend to anyone staying in Chicago for the weekend, we loved it!",nan,1,ex4122
expedia,My wife and I went to see a concert in Chicago and chose to stay at the Hard Rock Hotel. The staff was very friendly and they upgraded our room to a room with an amazing view of Michigan avenue for free. The room was very spacious and extremely comfortable. I will always stay at this hotel anytime I'm in Chicago.,nan,1,ex4123
expedia,"Although I am a die hard Hard Rock fan, I was not impressed with this hotel. There were items missing from the room and some of the ""details"" that you would expect from a hotel of this rating.",nan,1,ex4124
expedia,Waited 2.5hrs to check in after my arrival time of 2.30 in the afternoon. Shower water pressure is the worst I have experienced in 25 years of traveling . Must be flexible to reCh toilet paper !!,nan,1,ex4125
expedia,"Other than the unfriendly welcome, service and conditions were great! Be careful to not move items in fridge, even for your drunk chicken ceasar wrap leftovers, because everything you touch is automatically billed to your room. The staff was awesome though and removed it from our bill. Location? 10 out of 10! You should stay here simply for this reason.",nan,1,ex4126
expedia,"It was an average hotel that is over priced for the experience. Restaurant was one of the poorer experiences we have had and service mediocre. The elevator by floor was confusing. We had a friend staying on another floor and always had to go down to lobby and switch elevators. The coffee machine did not work in our room. The noise outside our room was awful. When someone went into their room, it sounded just like they were trying to get into our room. Hallway to the room is very dark and hard time seeing room #'s. My wife did not like going down the hallway alone.",nan,1,ex4127
expedia,It's a very nice Hotel. The suff is so friendly. I had a fantasitc time there. The shower wasn't that clean but the rest was perfect. If I'm back in Chicago I will choose this Hotel again.,nan,1,ex4128
expedia,For 300 would expect more than a comfort inn. Just nothing special for a high end price,nan,1,ex4129
expedia,Great hotel for a weekend getaway. Great entertainment and crowd.,nan,1,ex4130
expedia,Near everything that its turistic Comfortable beds Clean rooms Most important i didnt lost anithing at the hotel,nan,1,ex4131
expedia,"Went for the Chicago Marathon. The location was great! It was an average hotel for paying as much as my mom and I did, but we figured the prices were up because of the marathon.",nan,1,ex4132
expedia,"The hotel facilities, condition and cleanliness were excellent. The room was very comfortable and had a great view. I would recommended it to younger travelers, e.g. students or under the age of 35 since the theme of the hotel is very modern, but it is not something that would bother families or older couples and/or friends.",nan,1,ex4133
expedia,This was a PERFECT hotel for the price it was offered at.,nan,1,ex4134
expedia,Room air did not work. Bathroom had mold and grout chipped out.,nan,1,ex4135
expedia,The staff at hard rock were fantastic 100% brilliant. The menu lets the hotel down or lack of menu. In the room lack of viewing on the TV would be more comfortable to actually have programmes on there. Stopped in a lot better hotels but never had a hotel were the staff are just amazing and it's the staff that make the hard rock hotel.,nan,1,ex4136
expedia,Nice hotel but the Room smelled like bad bathroom odor. They switched our rooms though. Next was better. Comfort is excellent. I didn't like that I had to pay for wifi since we booked through. 3rd party. Parking was expensive.,nan,1,ex4137
expedia,Good one TO visit,nan,1,ex4138
expedia,"Booked for a Ladies Weekend and it was perfect! Location was best for great shopping, restaurants and theater. Could walk to ALL! Service was fast when we asked for more towels and coffee. Bar was fun on Saturday night for dancing. For a large busy hotel, it was quiet enough for a good sleep. View from floor 13 was good.",nan,1,ex4139
expedia,"Overall, great location for the race and comfortable rooms - despite the pipes rattling in the shower and the window not shutting properly, so you would continually hear the construction and sirens.",nan,1,ex4140
expedia,Very pleasant experience. Most of the employees were friendly and helpful. The room was quite comfortable.,nan,1,ex4141
expedia,"Very nice, and the staff very friendly and helpful. The only negative was the motion sensor snack bar that if accidently nudged could result in a charge on the bill. This item should be placed in a more isolated location in the room.",nan,1,ex4142
expedia,Fantastic hotel shame I was only there for one night!,nan,1,ex4143
expedia,"great stay at the Hard Rock. Love all of the music playing, good vibe at this place",nan,1,ex4144
expedia,Excelente y de Maravilla,nan,1,ex4145
expedia,"Overall great stay!! Did not care for the huge marylin manson picture on the wall but whatever. The lounge was nice good drinks, got dessert from the restaurant to take to my room and it was just thrown in some foil pans and was pretty lousy. Other than that i had a great stay",nan,1,ex4146
expedia,"Well the Bears lost, who'd have thought?! But the sunshine, shops, lake front walk, Ditka's steak, and the hotel room made for a great weekend.",nan,1,ex4147
expedia,Muy amable el personal. Bien ubicado y suficiente en tamano de la habitacion,nan,1,ex4148
expedia,Great stay all around. Brought a fender guitar to our room and the hotel bar knows how to turn up on the weekend,nan,1,ex4149
expedia,Decor is very dark and gloomy bordering on depressing!! the comforter had dirty stains on it but toilet was roomy and very clean.,nan,1,ex4150
expedia,Excellent hotel and restaurant!!!,nan,1,ex4151
expedia,The outside of the hotel looks nice and is centrally located to lots of good places to eat and shop. The inside is not as nice. The bathroom floors had severe water damage which made waking on them uncomfortable. It was like surfing your way across the bathroom. If you want to change the pressure on the shower head prepare for a loud tea kettle squeal that doesn't stop. The magnified mirrors light didn't work. Sirens went off all night. You can't use the mini fridge because it has those sensors that charge you in them. The bed was smaller than expected and the pillows were miserably flat... Both of them. On the plus side they stored our luggage for us while we walked around. All in all our hotel was the most expensive and worst part of our trip. We won't be back here again as there are better options.,nan,1,ex4152
trip_advisor,"We were attending a day-time conference at the Field Museum, with a dinner to follow, so we decided to stay ""in-town"". The Hilton was a great choice; mainly for location, but it turned out to be great all the way around. Outstanding service from folks who actually seemed to be enjoying their jobs. Everyone from the valet to the bartenders were pleasant and caring.",nan,nan,ta_s0
trip_advisor,Stayed at this hotel for a conference. It was very large and quite busy. Lots of elevators which made it easy to get from floor to floor. The most expensive rooms are quite lovely especially on T3 and T4. They have fabulous views of the lake. All of the staff seemed quite friendly and willing to assist whenever needed.,nan,nan,ta_s1
trip_advisor,"Rooms were fine; beds were good; room was not as clean as I would expect for the price. Dusting is not high on their list of priorities in cleaning the room. As a HHonors member, I expected some perks but there were none. There was a charge to use the exercise room, for storing luggage from checkout until time to leave for airport, for use of wifi - they provide a nice computer in the room but the only thing it was just an annoyance because the monitor came on without any assistance early in the morning. There is no turn-down service, no chocolate on your pillow. So if you are looking for an expensive hotel with a good bed and clean sheets, this is the place to go.",nan,nan,ta_s2
trip_advisor,"Perfect location for parks, museums, and convention center but still convenient to the shopping on the Magnificent Mile. This was my second trip to Chicago in 3 weeks so I wasn't too excited about the return. This hotel on this side of the River gave me a completely different visit. Great staff and location. Be prepared because the hotel has been left in its dated state and there are some good and bad things about this. I loved the old feel, but there are some places where they need to check tattering and the rooms for wear and tear. The very large sitting areas on each floor are so amazing and distinctive to this hotel. The place is just beautiful in a dated way. I stayed here 14 years ago with my daughter in the same type of two bathroom room and not much had changed. This hotel is great if you need to get to the convention center or museum area. There are many great places to eat within walking distance.",nan,nan,ta_s3
trip_advisor,"For a 100 year old building in Chicago, this one is in great shape. The rooms were large and some even had 2 bathrooms. The staff were great and were always willing to answer any questions we had. The dining options were also great. You could grab a quick bite to eat or have nice dining experiences in one of their onsite restaurants. The location was also very convenient to many of the great Chicago landmarks.",nan,nan,ta_s4
trip_advisor,"Booked a room last minute at the Hilton, as the hotel I stayed had terrible service - wifi was down for 2 days straight, and they even nearly lost one of my couriers. Moved out to the Hilton, which was slightly cheaper - but charged a whopping $450+ because it was conference season.The room was run down and tired, and I reckon I was handed one of the rooms that hadn't been refurbished yet. Not a problem, but the least they could do is not charge top dollar for a rather poor quality room. The wallpaper was peeling off the wall, the paint on the door was chipped, and the room was awfully noisy! Oh, and they had this old PC in the room which I believe was from the time when Spock was still young and alive.I reckon I won't stay here again till I've had a chance to see their new refurbished rooms, because I reckon I overpaid 2-3 times what the room should have been worth. Even during conference season.",nan,nan,ta_s5
trip_advisor,"The hotel is over 90 years old and is a true heritage The rooms are renovated ad used to have more than 3,000 ad after renovation, rooms have been enlarged and total count is 1,500. Rooms are in good condition and well maintained. Also the rooms are cleaned well. Service at the front desk could be improved though. Breakfast in the Executive Floor Lounge is very simple and also service at breakfast at the All Day Dining could be bette too. The location is good rigth at city center.",nan,nan,ta_s6
trip_advisor,"I stayed here for one Saturday night. The check-in process was good because I used the Hilton honors line. I had a room on the executive level with two beds and two bathrooms. Had a great view of lake Michigan. I didn't take advantage of all the services that the hotel had to offer such as free refreshments, free continental breakfast, concierge, etc. Great location. Staff was friendly too. Can't think of anything to complain about.",nan,nan,ta_s7
trip_advisor,"We stayed here for a national professional meeting. It seemed a little expensive until we used the facilities. They were worth it. Our suite was spectacular and the fitnesses area would rival the best health club. The morning buffett was the best I have had in any hotel, including chef made omelets, multiple very fresh fruit and baked goods. The staff was top notch and midwest friendly. And it was walking distance to the Shedd Aquarium, Field Museum and the Planetarium (Soldier's Field was a short cab ride away). The facility is gorgeous--so if you don't mind the price, this is a GREAT place to stay.",nan,nan,ta_s8
trip_advisor,"I just came back from a convention held the the Hilton. I had a special rate: almost 300$ per night. Reception is fast. The room was large overlooking beautiful Lake Michigan. It needed a bit revamping and a more imaginative designer. WiFi is not free unlike most other hotels I have been to. No free WiFi in 2015 is almost like having to pay for the towells. By the way, the towells will soon need to be replace! No bathrobe. Shampoo and a bar of soap. That's it. Even no QTips! No slippers. Mini bar was a warm not working fridge. But the worst was the eating at this hotel. There is not one reason to serve so low quality of food in such an hotel.. And no reason either for having to wait in a line of 20+ people to pay at the Herb N' Kithchen where they have the Starbuck! Good meeting facilities.",nan,nan,ta_s9
trip_advisor,"This is a hotel with glorious history and managed by the famus Hilton group. I am disappointed to stay that their standard did not live up to my expectation .Rooms a spacious but old. Internet connection is valuable in lobby only, if you wish to get online in your room, you have to pay an expensive price for the wifi. Breakfast is ok but again very expensive. Overall, it is quite disappointing. An grade ""C+"" experience.",nan,nan,ta_s10
trip_advisor,"We stayed at the Chicago Hilton for 5 nights. Our first time ever in Chicago. The room was a little small - actually I think it was too much furniture for the room. Beautiful but dated. There were several volleyball teams there and yet the halls were so quiet. The food line in the morning is ridiculously long and its the same line for Starbucks. Almost better to walk down the street to a different coffee shop. We loved the proximity to restaurants, parks, and major attractions. We felt the prices were very affordable. Definately will stay again.",nan,nan,ta_s11
trip_advisor,"We'd stayed here once maybe 10 years ago and it was fine, if not sufficiently memorable to bring us back, but we figured it would suffice for our recent 3-night business trip. We could not have been more wrong. If I provide all relevant details this review will extend for pages, so I will restrict myself to highlights. First, this hotel has airline-like policies, so if you want to go to the gym or use wifi or receive a package, you are nickled and dimed. Forget about dropping off a package outside of normal business hours - the front desk, concierge and security staff all indicated that someone from the other department was responsible for holding packages (even prepaid packages complete with UPS label), with the end result that I took my UPS package to NY on a plane and delivered it in person. Not what you'd expect of a hotel that markets itself as good for business. Second, the hotel feels like it specializes in catering to shady characters. The renovation that occurred between our prior and recent stays succeeded in erasing all charm remaining in this former grand dame hotel, resulting in a style I'd call ""cheap roadside motel generic."" My husband and I arrived separately, but the front desk refused to give my husband a second key or to earmark one for me. Rather, they had to ""see me in person,"" which meant I had to stand in the interminable checkin line even though we were checked in to pass visual inspection. And, when we ordered drinks in the lounge one evening, the waitress said she was not allowed to bring my drink while I was in the ladies room - she had to see me in order to put it down. I don't indulge in any fantasies that we appear rowdy or suspicious or like troublemakers - we are quiet, rule-abiding people clearly several decades past age 21 - but we were meant to feel like we were trying to sneak around somehow. The bed, itself comfortable, featured a bare duvet sandwiched loosely between two sheets, and we kept waking up with the naked duvet on our skin. I saw no evidence on the housekeeping carts that these are laundered between guests. UGH. Finally, our first room was ""sick."" It is true that the front desk clerk did not himself experience the miasma, but it was confirmed by an engineer, and we were clearly disoriented and sick when we finally presented ourselves at the front desk. The clerk had told us when we called down that no other rooms were available, and that the only option was for housekeeping spray the room with odor-masking chemicals, so we prepared ourselves to find another hotel on our own - by now it was well after midnight. When the clerk realized we were ready to decamp, he magically found another room in the hotel. He did reduce our room rate for that one night by half, which we had not asked for and did appreciate, but given that we were fearful for our health or worse (I had always viewed the phrase ""overcome by fumes"" with some skepticism, but never again), and he clearly thought we were being alarmist, the whole response seemed weak and reluctant. Honestly, though, I feel like this particular incident could have happened everywhere. I would not have rated our experience ""terrible"" had the other issues not presented themselves, especially the complete lack of even a show of interest of trying to help me solve my package issue. However, given the entire picture, at a minimum we will never return to this hotel, and more likely we will not patronize any Hilton-branded property again save for under duress.",nan,nan,ta_s12
trip_advisor,"My husband and I have just returned from our first trip to Chicago and everything from the city to the hotel was magnificent!We felt extremely welcome from the moment we arrived, staff were very friendly and our room on the 25th floor was wonderful! Hotel location was ideal and very easy to get around the city from, plus hotel facilities were great.Didn't manage to get all staff members names but porters were especially helpful as well as Robert the Executive floor manager.When we return to Chicago this will be our first choice of hotel!",nan,nan,ta_s13
trip_advisor,"My family had our spring ""staycation"" here. It's right across from Lake Michigan and is a short walk to the Museum Campus (Field Museum, Shedd Aquarium, Adler Planetarium). This hotel is huge, but has an intimate feel. It's big, grand and beautiful, but not pretentious. Every staff person we interacted was with was friendly and helpful (especially those folks at the front desk). They make you feel like a special guest. A neat feature about this hotel is the rooms with dual baths, which is really nice for families or groups of two or more. The breakfast buffet was excellent. I don't say this often, but our stay here was perfect.",nan,nan,ta_s14
trip_advisor,"Extremely disappointed by my two-night stay at this clearly tired property. My room was dated, the double bed lumpy, the wi-fi spotty (if even present...), the bathroom small, the HVAC maybe or maybe not actually connected, the outside HVAC equipment loud, the ""Irish"" bar inauthentic, the ""gift"" of two waters as a Hilton Honors guest not necessarily that generous...On the plus side, great location, and it's cool that it has 14 elevators.",nan,nan,ta_s15
trip_advisor,"The Hilton Chicago is a classic, historically significant hotel. As such, one cannot expect the most spacious rooms.There's not many rooms that actually face the lake and provide a great view. I was fortunate enough to do some research and find one executive room that did, however, I had to resign myself to two double beds, as apparently king bed rooms do not face the lake.The space per room was not utilized well. The executive rooms lack any area for a laptop to be set up. The only 'desk area' is consumed by an aging pay-to-use computer terminal, which is completely and wholly unneeded considering the availability of laptops. These need to be ripped out to give actual desk space to the guest.The executive lounge was under renovation, and coupons were given for an appetizer and a continental breakfast downstairs, or $15 off food at one of their quick serve restaurants. My checkout process took well over 15 minutes, as an airline crew had check in priority at the Hilton Honors desk, as well as dealing with another party that could not procure an actual payment method for a room. This extended checkout meant I could not make it to the quick serve restaurant until 11:05AM, where they promptly refused to accept my coupon, despite food still being available.This is the first Hilton I've ever seen with a luggage check that charges money. I had a late afternoon train, so I asked to store luggage. The fee, $2, was cash only. I was told I could pay when I picked up my luggage, but the fee would now be $4. So much for a full service hotel.In the future I cannot foresee any reason to stay here when the Conrad Chicago is available, as well as the Hampton Inn/Homewood Suites, which are located in a much more central portion of Michigan Avenue.",nan,nan,ta_s16
trip_advisor,Stayed at this hotel for spring break with the family. The location is incredible as it is on Michigan Avenue overlooking Lake Michigan itself. It is close to the loop and museums. The hotel has an amazing grand entrance. The check-in was a bit hard to find as you have to go past the entrance area to a smaller hallway further in and then head to the right but once we found it the staff were helpful and got us checked in promptly. We were upgraded to a room with a lake view and two bathrooms. The rooms were nice and felt spacious for a downtown hotel and the rate we paid which was very reasonable. The hotel had a chic feel to it that was very nice. It felt like it should be much more up-market that the price indicated. One downside is that the restaurants on site seem a bit limited. We had lunch and breakfast at the hotel. There is an Irish bar which we didn't try. Then there is a grab and go sort of place which we also didn't go to. The main restaurant across from the check-in was okay but nothing special. We had the breakfast buffet which was okay but nothing special and then a lunch. The chicken sandwich I had was okay but nothing special. With a lot of options in the neighborhood not having a great selection of restaurants in the hotel was not a big deal but it did feel like something was missing.We were happy with the hotel and I would definitely recommend it if you are looking to stay somewhere in the downtown area.,nan,nan,ta_s17
trip_advisor,"I booked this hotel in 4 months and got an awesome rate. So we are off to a great start.From the moment I stepped in the hotel lobby, I experienced great service, from the valet to the cleaning staff. The lady (I think her name was April) who checked me in was AWESOME! She was really nice, conversational and provided excellent customer service. She upgraded my room to one with a view and all I can say is WOW! She put me on the 12th floor on Michigan Ave. Because this room is on the street, you do hear the traffic and the Metra trains across the street, but the view makes it worth it. I had a perfect view of Lake Michigan (watching the sunrise was bliss), Navy Pier and Solider Field.The hotel is about a 15-20 minute walk from The Cloud Gate (the ""bean""), Millennium Park and the Chicago Art Institute. The Museum of Contemporary Photography is a block away (they have a free exhibit on the Black Dandy until mid-July 2015). So it is a little further from the action, but the service and the view made up for that!The room was very clean and spacious. One small thing that put a little black mark on the review... they would not allow me to check out late for free at 3pm - the hotel was not fully booked. But they do offer bag storage for $2/bag.I loved this hotel and would definitely come back.",nan,nan,ta_s18
trip_advisor,"I looked at many hotels (online, of course) as we were planning our spring break family getaway, but I chose the Hilton Chicago for a couple reasons. First, the location is great. We wanted to hit the museums as well as be within walking distance of Michigan Ave and other city attractions. We found all that in the Hilton. We were able to walk to the museums, Millennium Park (several times!) and to dinner each night. It also gave the kids a great taste of being in the big city - busy sidewalks, city lights - all the good stuff. :) Next, I like to keep my money, so I wanted a good deal. The ""Chillcation"" package at the Hilton gave us a few extras as well as included parking. Thank the gods! As someone who lives in the suburbs, paying Chicago prices for parking is painful. All in all, we were very happy with the Hilton. Our room was lovely and we were on a corner, so we had 3 windows. The view wasn't all that fantastic, but I didn't pay for a lake view, so I'm OK with that. Beds were comfy, plenty of shampoo/soap provided and even a computer in the room. Every employee we dealt with was competent and friendly. I'd definitely stay here again!",nan,nan,ta_s19
trip_advisor,"Close to museums, close to shoping area, close to downtown, close to Willis tower.Gor Chicago City Pass.In two days visited 4 museums, tower, did shopping, enjoyed Gino's East Pizza. Quiet place, clean, pool on 8th floor. For two days walked around 9am-9pm with two 8 years ols kids and they were never tired. Check in /out very easy.Will look again for low season prices in this hotel. There is much to see in Chicago and I feel we have seen only 30% of it.",nan,nan,ta_s20
trip_advisor,"I loved this historic hotel from the moment I walked in. It is really beautiful, elegant and so remarkable if you consider how old it is. We arrived very early for our one night stay and were able to get in our room right away. There are a couple things worth noting. This hotel is not right in the heart of the shopping on Michigan Ave. If you do a day of heavy shopping, you'd probably want to take a cab back to the hotel especially if you're not a fan of walking about a half mile or so after being on your feet all day. It is near the park and offers good views of the lake and the museum campus. Although the hotel is historic, the rooms are modern. Our room with two double beds was spacious and had plenty of storage and closet space. The bathroom was not luxurious but sufficiently large. The furnishings were very comfortable. Our room was fairly quiet. We could hear some street noise but not enough to disturb our sleep.Parking is a big deal in Chicago and we took advantage of one of the packages the hotel was offering that included parking. The parking ramp is right behind the hotel and is easy to navigate. We enjoyed being able to walk out the door and cross the street to the park to go for a run in the morning. It's just a couple of blocks to the lake shore path if you want to run there.",nan,nan,ta_s21
trip_advisor,"We stayed for 2 nights as we got married in Chicago. We had 3 rooms total and we were on floors 24,20 and 10 which was not convenient. This is a hotel for conventions, not families or romance. It is huge and not friendly. The room had a great view. Had to call 3 times for towels (took a total of 8 hours) and we should have had a small fridge in our room. Called for that and they said they could not put it where the fridge is supposed to go so it sat against the wall. Also if you want them to hold you luggage it is $2.00 per bag and on the 2nd floor. I have paid much less and stayed in much nicer hotels in Chicago. Not a friendly feel at all but a great view. Also the wi fi never worked and the computer system you are supposed to use for room service, entertainment etc...worked about 10% of the time.",nan,nan,ta_s22
trip_advisor,Wonderful hotel! Booked my room several months in advance so I got a really good rate.When I got there they upgraded us with no extra charge. The hotel was very clean. Stayed on an upper floor with a lake view. It was beautiful. All the staff were very friendly and helpful. The concierge was a great help with finding the correct buses to take. This is going to be my place to stay whenever I go to Chicago.,nan,nan,ta_s23
trip_advisor,"We choice this hotel for a mini spring break trip and we're so happy with the selection! We were able to get a ""Chillcation"" package that was a good room rate, included parking ($55/day value), 20% hotel restaurants, free wifi and nice thermo mugs for free coffee/hot chocolate.The hotel lobby was beautiful and the entire building has a historical yet modern charm to it. We were upgraded to a double bathroom which was perfect for our family of 4. The room was a decent size and clean. The only thing missing amenity was a mini fridge.The hotel is within walking distance to the museum campus and not in such a heavily congestive area that its difficult to drive. This is much of the reason why we selected this part of town to stay in. The pool was the second driving factor because the kids love to swim and there isn't many options in Chicago (at least nice options). The pool was a lap pool and were satisfied but it wasn't really designed for their experience. The staff seemed to be patient with the influx of activity due to spring break. We had breakfast, a snack and a dinner at their on-site restaurants and all seemed to be decent selections. The staff was friendly and helpful throughout the entire stay.Overall, the stay was very nice and we would recommend the hotel to others. We even saw a ""celebrity"" from the 80's but we won't call her/him out. ;)",nan,nan,ta_s24
trip_advisor,"This is a historic hotel with old charm and modern updates. We didn't spend too much time in the hotel but when we did we were impressed with the size and amenities it had to offer. It has a coffee shop, small shopping, bar, and a great exercise area. It is close to the L Red stop that allows you to be able to take the train from the airport (O'Hare for us). The room was larger than expected and extremely clean. The only downside was that the coffee machine had not been replenished from the previous travelers. As mentioned, it is close to an L Red Stop that will allow you quick access to the loop or anywhere the L goes. We had purchased a three day pass on the L which made our travel easy and cheap during the trip. Grant Park is across the street and is great for wondering and enjoying the day outside. You can get to the lakefront trail for a run or walk along the lake.",nan,nan,ta_s25
trip_advisor,"I took my daugther and her friend to Chicago over Easter break and we stayed at the Hilton across from Grant Park. One of the reasons I chose this hotel was the room set up: two double beds and two bathrooms. The girls shared the larger bathroom and I had the other all to myself! The hotel itself is very posh, and service was also very good. It is an easy walk to Shedd, the Field Museum, or Adler,(about a mile) as well as a short taxi ride (about $10) to Navy Pier or Magnificient Mile shopping. We didn't eat at any of the hotel's restaurants, but room service was quick and good, not too expensive. The lobby coffee shop also had a lot of grab and go choices. The pool isn't large, but it was nice to soak in the hot tub after a day of walking around the city and museums. Parking at the hotel was convenient, and we had a special package that included parking, which generally runs about $50/day at many downtown hotels, so that was another factor is choosing the Hilton. We had a great visit and felt like VIPs the entire time.",nan,nan,ta_s26
trip_advisor,"The Chicago Hilton is quite a grand, old hotel with lots of history. The architecture is from the 20's and beautiful, but this hotel has so much more to offer.The lobby area and rooms could use some updating - carpet, decor, curtains, and bedding was plain and old looking and gave the appearance of looking dirty. We were registered as 4 guests sharing a room but we could not get the hotel to give us 4 towels - ever - even after repeated calls! Beds were not very comfortable. The location of the hotel is in a great place and near public transportation. Lots of stores and tourist attractions are close by. The hotel has a convenient 'Herb & Kitchen' grab and go for food, but take your wallet, because prices are outrageously expensive, or better yet check out Trader Joe's down the street.Overall, I'd rate the hotel as average based this experience.",nan,nan,ta_s27
trip_advisor,"Really good location, really helpful when you want to visit all the museums, aquarium, the city. go shopping and when you finish you can relax in the hotel and enjoy your stay. I visited Chicago for 3 days and been HHonors Member was great, having some extras in the stay. one other thing HHonors has this option to upgrade your room, you can pay an small amount or only use your points, that is really good when you dont want to spend to much and have the great options.",nan,nan,ta_s28
trip_advisor,"The once grand hotel welcomed heads of states and the Queen of England. And you know why when you stay there. First ya just gotta love a hotel room with two full bathrooms! This was my second year staying here and it's not only beautiful the staff is great. Our only problem this year was the housekeeper kept forgetting to leave towels and coffee. Every day except for our last day, we were there for a week, we had to call and request towels and coffee. It's lovely",nan,nan,ta_s29
trip_advisor,"I was here recently on business and loved my stay. I was upgraded to a beautiful corner room on the 22nd floor. The hotel is one of the older ones in the city, but has been renovated recently and you couldn't tell how old it really was. It has charm and the location is right across from Millenium park. Loved my stay!",nan,nan,ta_s30
trip_advisor,I was here for a week for a convention. I absolutely loved the hotel and the area. The hotel was very historic and very well kept. Enjoyed the room the bed was very comfy. The bathroom and the room could use some updating. Wallpaper was coming off the wall and chargers kept falling out of the wall. My view out the window was of a roof and another room. Staff was very helpful and friendly at this hotel.,nan,nan,ta_s31
trip_advisor,"I was in town for a large conference, housed within the hotel. I have to say, for a large conference hotel, it was an excellent stay. The staff was by far some of the friendliest and most helpful that I've had in a hotel, even as they were sold out and insanely busy. The hotel itself is a historic treasure and beautiful. The lobby alone is worth wandering around in for a while. On the room front, we had an upgraded Executive Floor room, which was lovely. Not super huge, but had a good view of the city and was new.The location is pretty great too. You're agross the street from the park and a couple of blocks from the L, so there is plenty to do right outside the door as well as easy access around the city.",nan,nan,ta_s32
trip_advisor,"We picked this hotel because of a great deal that we found on hotels.com, and we didn't go wrong. This hotel is within 5 blocks of Shedd Aquarium. Unfortunately, it was too cold for us to walk so we ended up taking a taxi but in better weather, it would have been a perfect location. We had a lakeview room on the 11th floor. The view was amazing and our room had two bathrooms in it which was perfect for our family. The customer service is great as well. Our blow dryer did not work and we called down for a new one and within 10 minutes, we were provided with a brand new one. The computer was set up to turn on every morning at 8:00, which was sortof creepy but it was convenient in helping you navigate around the hotel. Taxi's were reasonable as well. We were out $10 to go from this hotel to the American Girl store. From there, we were able to walk to the Observatory and then down to Gino's East on Superior and catch a taxi back. There is a great starbucks downstairs along with some homemade ice cream and all sorts of food items. We did not partake in the restaurants but the stuff at the snack bar was good. The pool on the 8th floor was really nice! It is a lap pool and there were also two hot tubs - one for adults only and one that the kids could play in. The gym looked really nice too but we did not use it. The bedding and rooms were very clean and the beds were comfortable. If you get a chance to see the grand ballroom, I suggest it. This room is breathtaking!",nan,nan,ta_s35
trip_advisor,"I'm here alone for a conference. The room is fine. Not an option for my family of 4 because the two bed rooms are double beds, which are too tiny for an adult and large child. There's room for larger beds in most hotel rooms yet it is always hard to find such places. Why?The place is huge. Took a day to figure out the conference rooms. The rooms are not ideal for sound because rooms pickup sound from other rooms. I'm on a workout kick and headed to the gym. Learned they wanted $15 to use the equipment. Really?! It's a nice gym but I'm used to places where there is no fee to work out. It's not like someone is giving you a massage. The front desk gave it to me complimentary when I whined about it. There are quick notes to eat a short walk from hotel. It's ridiculously cold out, however so many may not want to walk. I'd choose this hotel if rooms were better for families if I wanted to go to the nearby museums, but the double beds are a huge minus. There is room for one or two air beds, so that's an option if you wanted to bother bringing such items or if hotel could guarantee roll always. In short, the location, the elegant space, and the nice accommodations make this a great choice for 1 or 2 people.",nan,nan,ta_s36
trip_advisor,"It really is disturbing that WiFi is not included. Internet its not a luxury or an extra, it is as important as having a bathroom in the room!Very nice hotel otherwise, nice service, beautiful room and great location.

trip_advisor,My stay at the Hilton Chicago was excellent. Everyone was very accommodating and friendly from the minute we stepped into the hotel. The bell hop was funny and very nice. The hallways had a very faint good smell. I can't put my finger on what the smell was but it was delightful. We stayed on the 9th floor which has been remodeled and it was beautiful. We had a room facing the lake and we watched as a line of snow came across the lake. Sunrise was beautiful. There was a refrigerator in the room even though their website doesn't say anything about one being in the room. That was a plus. I don't usually like the smell of the bathroom toiletries but I did like the smell of the toiletries in the hotel! I recommend staying here. Had a great time.,nan,nan,ta_s39

Furnishings need to be updated, but were otherwise comfortable. Was strange to have two bathrooms in the double room.

Was very happy with our room and the breakfast buffet was outstanding; this was particularly the case on the morning of the race when they opened the restaurant an hour early to ensure the runners could fuel-up in advance of the race. The hotel is perfectly situated (parallel to North Michigan avenue) and is a great base from which to explore the city. For anyone doing the marathon it's also the ideal location and is only a ten minute walk to the start and finish line; very important when you've just ran 26 miles!,nan,nan,ta_s42
trip_advisor,"Nice hotel with helpful staff -- WITH THE EXCEPTION OF SECURITY. I would NEVER accept an adjoining room form this hotel if you value your sleep. I was there on business and the room next to me had over 35 people in it partying ALL NIGHT LONG. I called Security twice -- at 11:30 PM and at 3:30 AM and the response I received the next morning was that the room was not registered to anyone. Did Security do ANYTHING to investigate?

I also liked after 10p you needed your room key to get past security set up by the elevators.Hotel had a nice location near Millineun park, the L line and Grant park.The small bistro in the main lobby was nice, good coffee and for a hotel reasonably priced sandwiches, pizza slices etc.The actual rooms and hallways above the lobby are dated but clean and comfortable, and have all necessary amenities.

The Hilton was one of the host hotels and from the minute I checked in I was happy I chose to stay here. The front desk staff were efficient and accommodating to my requests. Although my room had not been renovated and was showing it's age a little, it was still clean and extremely comfortable. The housekeeper who was assigned to my room for the 3 days I was there was lovely to deal with and so friendly. The hotel has a few dining options. The Irish Pub I believe is independant of the hotel. The food and bevvies were pretty good. They have a small ""everything"" kind of food spot right off the lobby where you can get Starbucks, other beverages and fresh made hot food and cold packaged foods to go along with bottled beer and wine. They also have a sitdown restaurant and a BEAUTIFUL lounge at the other end of the hotel. There is also a great fitness facility with pool at the hotel....although there is a charge to use the equipment if you're not a Hilton Gold member (the pool and walking track are free to use). The hotel is ideally located for walking around to lots of little shops and ""THE BEAN"" at Millenium Park is maybe 5 blocks away. I can't wait to go back and stay again.",nan,nan,ta_s45

When he returned he gave me both cranberry as well as grape juice. I immediately thanked Burgess for it and told him i really appreciate what he did. He told me that the gentleman that was standing next to him happened to be his captain. As a captain thats NOT AT ALL SHOWING LEADERSHIP As a manager myself i would have never told the guest/customer no, what Burgess did was showing great LEADERSHIP for satisfying the customer/guest. I do hope that he will be acknowledged for this because even though it was something as small or simple as juice it made a difference and as a suggestion for these kinds of events maybe adding juice as an option would be better for guest.

We have seen many changes over the years , they are always improving or rehabbing rooms there. This year we stayed on the 10th floor . The floor and all rooms were recently rehabbed. We had a two bedroom, Michigan Ave. Suite like always. The bedrooms were sharp, comfortable, still having two bathrooms on the double and one in the King. The Parlor also has a full bathroom. The Parlor was furnished with two living areas, both having a large Flat screen. They finally put a large oval table in the middle that seats 6. My only disappointment was that they removed the 7' Marble bar that I always loved standing behind in the second living space. My suggestion would be to put the Mini Fridge in that section of the new Bar area and not in the other living area. It makes no sense to have to walk across the parlor to use the Fridge. Again , we had a great time and the Staff is one of the best around ! This Historic Hotel is keeping up with the Times and stays a Classic all at once.",nan,nan,ta_s49
trip_advisor,overall nice hotel but few things need to be fixed. the soap dishes in the shower were corroding with green corrosion obvious sign that attention to details is not there. the shower drain needs to be fixed showered for about 15 minutes standing in 6 to 8 inches of water I seriously doubt that it had just become a problem with me. Lastly the counter that had the tv on it had only been half wiped off and was also obvious had not been cleaned properly for some time was able to write kilroy was here in the dust. So with that not sure if I would stay there again.,nan,nan,ta_s50
trip_advisor,"We stayed at the Hilton for 4 nights prior to Christmas, and found it in need of updating. We stayed in a room on the 15th floor. I don't know about other areas of the hotel, but our room needed to enter the 21st century. The room was clean, but old and outdated. The staff were not really helpful when we checked in or when the hotel changed our room code and we were locked out. The front desk seemed to be understaffed, and we never could get anyone to come to the Hilton Honors section of the desk to help us (we are Honors members). Overall, it's a massive hotel in a convenient location with so-so staff and tired room decor. I hate the policies of supposedly top-tier hotels like this one that don't supply free wifi in rooms or access to the hotel gym. Our next stop on our trip was a Hampton Inn in suburban St. Louis, which was modern and staffed by the most caring, friendly people. What a contrast!",nan,nan,ta_s51
trip_advisor,"Admittedly we were there over the New Year's Eve period but waiting 10-15 minutes for an elevator every time you went downstairs, fighting crowds to get into the elevators or to the Cafe and rooms and corridors that look like they were last renovated when JFK was in office isn't hat I expected from a Hilton. Calling it a landmark and a classic isn't an excuse for letting it get old and packing join too many people for the old-age facilities. Staff were efficient but grumpy - apart from the serving staff in the Restaurant 720 South who were very good most of the other staff were grumpy and begrudging - felt like I was doing something wrong to ask simple assistance - so after a while I just stopped. I'm sure that there are a lot of better places in Chicago so I won't be going back - and I am a Diamond HHonours Guest!",nan,nan,ta_s52
trip_advisor,"We took our girls to stay here for the weekend during the 1D Concert at Soldier Field. The lobby and parking drop off was an absolute zoo - thankful I was hilton honors as the line for normal check in was three times as long as ours. Other than that aspect, the rooms are clean, spacious and quiet for this old brick gem. It has been updated- but you pay for it. Parking, water, wi-fi, breakfast are high - downtown prices. But you can walk to soldier field, the Bean, coffee shops and a few other ""chains"" right around the corner to mitigate expenses. We overlooked the pale facing the lake and could see Navy Pier; the down side is the traffic noise and the 6 am Sunday morning race in the park - you could hear every announcement and the music was loud. But that is summer in Chicago- this is an iconic hotel fit for any traveler - family, business, or weekend getaway. Millers pub was packed both nights after the concert and I will say they did NOT plan accordingly for the post concert rush at the market / Starbucks. Starving teenage girls at 11 pm don't want to hear you are out of anything! Be wary going out the back of the hotel - stay in groups - but it is beautiful and the service was spot on.",nan,nan,ta_s53
trip_advisor,"Have stayed at this hotel many times, last was the worst. We had a king suite with 2 baths, which is great, View of the lake, was awesome. Also had a bar and another king Murphy bed-when was the last time you saw a Murphy bed? It was in the living area, I could have put it up, but we put our bags on it. Great location to the Art Museum, Grant park is across the street. Now the bad- lounge which had snacks, sodas, and breakfast was closed, opening???? They did not know. No robes, slippers in room-this was a king premium suite. My bad I did not bring these, I had assumed, as prior visits, they would be there. We liked the pool area/hot tubs; but one day they had a red-neck luncheon with loud 15 adults and 20+ kids in and out of the hot spas, which by the way are not allowed, I guess they have trailer park rates-I wonder who they left behind to watch the double wides. I complained and got 2 breakfast coupons, good for the Sunday brunch-which was no different than the daily spread. Waiters were good- they do have a fantastic eggs benedict-you have to ask for it, different and delicious. We wanted a getaway weekend, disappointed. Stay at the Palmer house, great hotel, great bar.Went on Michigan Ave to look at the Christmas displays, called ""white devils"" by black panthers chanting on sidewalk, welcome to Obama's America.We will stay in New York. Also tons of preteens at the hotel at some youth conference, running and screaming in the hotel constantly.",nan,nan,ta_s54
trip_advisor,"The staff was very friendly and helpful at our recent stay at the Hilton. We were looking for just a quick overnight stay that would lend itself to touring downtown Chicago and letting the kids hang in the pool in the evening and the morning. The Hilton delivered. Location was great, the front desk staff was very nice and bonus that our standard double room had TWO bathrooms! Makes life a lot easier when you are a mom of two girls...the rooms have been recently renovated, so they are modern and clean. Probably the only downside is that movie rental is pricey. But I suppose that comes with downtown hotel territory. We are planning our return trip next Christmas break. Such a fun thing for parents and kids to do together!",nan,nan,ta_s55
trip_advisor,The Hilton New Years Eve party is a joke and I will not attend again. It was misrepresented on the website about what you get for the ticket price. DO not waste your money. $150 per ticket. No balloon drop. No toast at midnight. Bartenders were slow and service stopped at 1:00am. It took on average a half hour to get a drink. No place to sit down. Website said multiple ballrooms and there was only one available. Website also spoke of casino games but they were no where to be found. Avoid this party at all cost. Save your money.,nan,nan,ta_s56
trip_advisor,"I really recommend this hotel for people visiting Chicago. I always stay there. It gets better and better, It's conveniently located with great views of the lake and on the park and near to shopping. The gym, pool and spa are all well maintained and not overcrowded given a hotel this size. I stayed over the New Year's holiday. The hotel was full and catered to a wedding as well as the usual new year's crowd. Service and security were excellent. All staff were friendly, as usual and anxious to please. Breakfast and dinner were well prepared and served. And for me a mark of excellence is clean bathrooms. I will continue to stay here on my trips to Chicago.",nan,nan,ta_s57
trip_advisor,"We stayed here to ring in the New Year at the hotel. We checked in on Tuesday December 30 and was planning to stay until January 3, 2015. On Wednesday night there was a NYE party at the hotel which required party goers to wear arm bands. My wife and I had dinner reservations in the hotel at 720 Restaurant. When we finished dinner, we were heading to the elevators and noticed security checking arm bands of people before allowing them to the elevator. We were able to get by with the purple arm bands we were wearing. Later in the night around 1am, we were heading up to our room but was not allowed to because we did not have a yellow arm band. We proceeded to the front desk to find out why we were not told about this at check-in on Tuesday. The worker told us that they did not get the yellow arm bands until Wednesday and the checking for yellow arm bands went into affect at 6:00 pm. He also informed us that a message was left on our phone informing us of this. Remember, we were able to get up to our room wearing purple arm bands at 6:45pm. Once we got up to our room, we did not find a message on our phone informing us of the need for yellow arm bands. Two lies within 2 minutes of each other. As a Hilton Honors member who travels quite a bit, I was very turned off by this and very upset. The next day I went to speak to someone at the front desk to find out if it was normal practice to lie to guest and I was informed it was not. This person said that they would give me all four nights of my stay for $99.00 per night. When I received my bill the morning of check out, that was not the case. Lie number 3. Checking with the front desk to find out why the correction was not made, it appeared that I was an inconvenience to her. She left or 10 minutes to discuss with the manager about what could be done. In the end I got the price as stated above. I also used the concierge desk on several occasions and found the same person to be very rude both times. All you could get form her was, ""how can I help you"". Nothing along the lines of good morning how are you, nothing. Again it gave the appearance of an inconvenience for her having to assist someone. The people that run the Herb and Kitchen give the appearance that they are clueless at their jobs. It should not take 25 minutes to get 2 coffees and a Danish, but it did. We did receive great service at the bar and from the bell hops. Other than those two bright spots, this was by far the worse stay I have ever had at a Hilton property. Nest time I am in Chicago, I will not be staying there.",nan,nan,ta_s58
trip_advisor,"I just returned from our annual meeting in Chicago. Since the meeting was at McCormick Place, I chose a hotel closer to the Center but with a good reputation. I arrived very early, so I couldn't check in to my room. My phone number was taken so that I could be called when the room was ready. No surprise, I never got a phone call. When I checked in that evening, I was ""upgraded"" to a City View room. I can't imagine what my non-upgraded room was! I had a view of other rooms and the building across the street. Oh well, I guess not having status with Hilton makes a difference and I don't have status! Anyway, the room was a spacious king. However, the toilet seat wouldn't stay up and the tub drained very slowly. I was only here for 3 nights, so I managed. Yes, I could have called, but you'd think that housekeeping would notice. Anyway, the hotel itself was beautiful, and even though it was marathon weekend, I never waited long for an elevator. The bed was comfortable, the room clean and the location of the hotel was what I needed. Next time, though, a hotel on the Mag Mile north of the river would be better. There was always a need to take a cab to restaurants, etc. Overall, I was satisfied, but I think that only being a Blue level member hurts you at the Chicago Hilton. If the price is right, staying here is fine. It is a full service hotel, with restaurants, hair services, shops, and even a shoe shine. Would I stay here again? If I had to. There are just so many other choices in this city that are more convenient.",nan,nan,ta_s59
trip_advisor,"We took the Amtrak train to visit Chicago with our two sons, ages 8 and 10. I chose the Hilton Chicago because it was at the midway point between the Amtrak station and the attractions that we wanted to see. We arrived at Union Station a little after lunchtime on a Friday and carried our bags to the hotel. It was just over a mile and was easy to find. After depositing our suitcases, we hiked back the way we came to visit the Willis tower that afternoon. We had walked right by it on our way to the hotel but didn't want to try to take our luggage up the tower. We spent the next 3 days visiting Field Museum, the Museum of Science and Industry, and the Shedd Aquarium. The Field and Shedd are roughly one mile from the hotel and easy to walk to. There is a Metra Electric train station a block from the hotel which will take you to the Museum of Science and Industry. It was $3 each way and took 20 min (on weekends kids ride free too - Bonus!)The hotel location was perfect for our trip. I was also pleased with our room. When we checked in, they said we were in the recently renovated portion of the hotel. It had nice decor and enough room for the 4 of us to move around comfortably. The breakfast is horribly overpriced (as per usual at these level of hotels) but there are starbucks and other places to pick up food nearby. There is also Starbucks in the small cafe in the hotel itself. For dinner, there are many restaurants nearby within walking distance. We were tired and cold one night (we visited in December) after returning to the hotel so we opted to eat at the Irish grill there. It was uninspiring food, but decent and filling. And they had a decent beer selection. If you need to pick up a snack or something for breakfast in your room, there is a 7-11 store 2 blocks from the hotel. So I was very happy with how this hotel worked out for our stay and would recommend it.",nan,nan,ta_s60
trip_advisor,Myself and my son stayed in this hotel during visit to Chicago .It is a great hotel with spacious rooms .The outlook is traditional .I gather that this hotel is an old one right from world war 2 times .The ball room gives a majestic look .The places to visit in Chicago are located near to the hotel with the subway station at a walkable distance from hotel .Hence we could move around places through subway train.,nan,nan,ta_s61
trip_advisor,"We were celebrating the end of my cancer treatments and we couldn't have chosen a better place. The suite was very nice, the bed super comfy and the room very clean. The holiday decorations were beautiful and I loved the hotel trivia in the elevator. Learned some very cool things about the property while riding up and down. The pool area was very nice and we enjoyed the hot tub. Kitty O'Shea's was OK, not the best, but not bad. The doormen were very helpful and the location was convenient to the museums and shopping. There is not one bad thing to report on this historic property. We stayed in room 1163 and could see the lake from our room. Thank you, Hilton, for always providing as great stay!

From Bradford the VERY patient bellman to Alicia the top notch HHonors front desk person and everyone else, we had a great experience. If you treat people nicely, it comes back to you and that always goes both ways. We were given room upgrades and always had employees inquiring as to our well-being - from the front desk staff to the athletic club to housekeeping, the fantastic doorman, bartenders and wait staff.

The server was punctual and friendly, and the food was very good.I did not give the hotel the highest rating because of issues we had with the computerized service system and a minor housekeeping issue. The hotel was notified of both issues and addressed them during our stay.",nan,nan,ta_s64
trip_advisor,"This is a stunning, classic property. We stayed at the end of a wonderful Thanksgiving week to be closer to the airport. The holiday decorations were beautiful although I didnt see a Hanukkah menorah anywhere. Overall it was a great stay. The staff was incredible with extra kudos to Alison at the Bell Desk and Aleisha at the HHoners front desk. The location was perfect, right accross from Grant Park and just minutes from everywhere. Our only problem was the room. While it was newly renovated it was very tiny and looks nothing like the pictures on the hotel site. The room was so small that I bumped my head on the wall when seated on the bed to remove my shoes. There waas a useless bench at the foot of the bed that took up most of the space between the bed and desk that I stubbed my toes each time I walked by. Also the thermostat in the room was disfunctional. Lastly, our most desirable amenity was missing from the room, no in room coffe pot as was clearly listed under hotel amenities. Better ask for an upgrade if you are travelling with more than one person. On a better note, dont miss Kitty O'Shea's in the lobby. Great food, great drink and great service.",nan,nan,ta_s65

When we walked in to our room, we saw lots of crumbs all over the floor, filthy counters and the carpeting was old and ripped. We travelled so many times in a year for how many years now and we never experienced anything like it. Yes we got an apology from the front desk who checked us in about the downgrade but that was it for all the inconvenience. We would have thought for a Hilton Hotel you would have gotten anything better than this.",nan,nan,ta_s66
trip_advisor,"We are a family of four and stayed here for one night after visiting the Field Museum all afternoon. The hotel is within walking distance from the Museum. The lobby was beautifully decorated for Christmas. Even though they were very busy, the check-in was friendly and went smoothly. Our two connecting rooms were on the 14th floor facing the lake. They had recently been renovated and were nicely done. The rooms were large especially the one with two double beds. Both rooms had a small refrigerator and a two seat sofa as well as a desk chair. The bathrooms were modern and very clean. The heating system was very quiet and kept a constant temperture in the rooms. The windows were equipped with both a day and night shade. We had a very nice swim in the pool before checking out. We enjoyed dinner in the 720 Bar as the restaurant was closed. After bar appetizers we were allowed to order dinner from the closed resturant menu. The food was fresh and cooked just the way we ordered it. The portions were so large that we had to box some to take back to the rooms and put in the refrigerators. We enjoyed the breakfas buffet in the 720 restaurant. All the normal breakfast items and eggs cooked to order. Throughout our stay at this beautiful hotel we were met with friendly smiling employees who were willing to help in any way. We will be staying here again soon.",nan,nan,ta_s67

This hotel is BEAUTIFUL. The decor and the gigantic Christmas tree were so delightful - especially this time of year! Made for such an easy stay! Check-in was quick, the amenities were great and the room was in line with the rest of the hotel. The room had what we needed. Beds were comfy.

Chicago is a wonderful town and so many things to do/see near the hotel. Great location, food was wonderful at the hotel as well. Only issue we had was noise from the hallways leaking into our room.

The historic components of the hotel were truly stunning and the service was wonderful, we truly felt like VIPs even though it was just my husband, two kids, and me staying for a little family fun overnight. The breakfast was delicious and we couldn't believe all the perks we got for one low price. There was a formal event going on in the hotel that night, and so during the night we heard some drunken shenanigans going on in the hallway, but that is not the hotel's fault. We will DEFINITELY be coming back!! Probably the best hotel experience we've ever had. We felt so fancy and well-treated and the kids loved the lights in the pool too.",nan,nan,ta_s71
trip_advisor,"The Hilton on Michigan Ave. in Chicago is one of my favorite hotels...steeped in tradition, and we generally love opportunities to stay there. Unfortunately, our most recent trip was tarnished by an inept and somewhat curt front desk employee who essentially disregarded our early check in request and left my spouse (a cancer patient) lingering in the lobby for 5 hours after promising a wait of no more than an hour....and she had to go back to him...he never came to find her. The refreshments I had ordered for her to have during the afternoon while I was out on business did not arrive until evening. This employee was completely aloof about taking any ownership of this unpleasantness or offering any solutions and I had to resort to locating the front desk manager the next morning. Fortunately, that person fully understood Hilton's exceptional quest service policies and went above and beyond to accomodate us and make amends.",nan,nan,ta_s72

We heard the rumbling of trains all three days we were there. Their frequency was about every 2-3 minutes. We were also near the Lake Rooms which was opposite a service hallway. We overcame the noise, but will request not to stay in that area of the hotel again.",nan,nan,ta_s73
trip_advisor,My husband and I stayed here one night while we were in town to see the Chicago Symphony Christmas show. The hotel is in a GREAT location! The hotel itself is old and classy but it has some problems. Our room was located on the 16th floor and when you walk into the room the bed is RIGHT next to the door. We went to bed at 11 PM and were woken up numerous times during the night by people being loud in the hallway. There was also sticky stuff on the night stand and the lamp was broken. It seemed a little over priced for such an old hotel. But I guess you pay for the location!,nan,nan,ta_s74
trip_advisor,"This was not my first stay at the Chicago Hilton, but my third. It was however my first stay in about 10 years. They have made some serious renovations to modernize this classic beauty. This iconic hotel on South Michigan Ave has some serious history to it and they let you know about it every turn. Heck, even in the elevators there's a scrolling ""did you know"" type of quiz constantly running.I was fortunate enough to get a room on one of the renovated floors, which was fantastic! It was like staying at any modern Hilton with all the ammenities: wifi, excellent lighting, modern furniture, HDTV, modern bathroom and tile. Loved it!Parking is absurd, but you won't get away from that in any hotel in Chicago... real estate is rare so parking is expensive. My only other gripe is that a lot of the rooms will have a view of a wall. The hotel has several ""inlets"" where the windows face another room or a brick wall. It's really hard to avoid unless you've got status or pay out extra money for a lake view.",nan,nan,ta_s75
trip_advisor,"I stayed for one night at the Hilton Chicago, in November. When I reserved the room, parking was included in my rate. When I arrived at the hotel the valet guys told me to go ahead an park and keep the ticket and they would validate at the front desk. I arrived before 3:00p.m. and was able to check in right away. I got to my room and was really surprised at how spacious it was. I've stayed at other hotels in Chicago and the rooms are much smaller. It was nice to have the extra space. My room faced the skyline of Chicago so I couldn't complain about the view. I was in Chicago to do some shopping and visit some friends, so I didn't take advantage of the amenities the hotel has to offer, but it all looked great. The location is great. A bit South of all the shopping on Michigan Ave, but the walk is well worth it. It is across from Grant Park, near Millenium Park and the Field Museum. I would definitely stay here again when visiting Chicago.",nan,nan,ta_s76

I have noticed they are cutting back on maintenance and some of the wonderful attractions, like the gingerbread house by the elevators etc. I hate to see these little things go away! It's part of the Chicago Hilton tradition to which many of us have become accustomed at Christmas! Kittie(sp?) O'Shea's is open only on a limited basis. It was closed on Tuesday before the Midwest Clinic this year. Kittie's has ALWAYS BEEN the gathering place for Directors from around the world on Tuesday before Midwest. Shame!

The location across from Grant Park, near Millenium Park and Museum Campus, is the best in the Loop.The check-in was easy as you can now choose your room online prior to arriving. The Athletic Club pool and sauna were a great way to start and/or end the day and the rooms were well appointed. The Executive Level is under renovation and the Concierge Desk and Executive Lounge are closed. Floors 25 and 22 are open. They are giving certificates for breakfast, (be sure you get the one for the weekend 720 Breakfast Buffet) and evening appetizers at Kitty O'Shea's. I was told the first stage will be completed in February and then they'll swap to the other floors.The grand Christmas Tree was up, but sadly no Gingerbread House this year.

trip_advisor,"Stayed for one night on the 20th of December. Check in was fine except for the staff member trying to convince me that I didn't want the room with the king sized bed I'd paid for and that she was doing me a favour by offering me a room with two doubles or a 'Murphy bed'. After much faff I was finally given the room I'd originally asked for. Call me old fashioned but I don't equate two doubles or a drop down occasional bed to a standard king size. The hotel was obviously pretty busy due to the debutants ball but still no reason to shaft paying customers. The room itself was decent and reflected the price paid. It had apparently been refurbished but after a night of interrupted sleep it was pretty clear that the recent works did not extend to upgrading the non existent sound proofing. From kids mouthing off in the halls to the sounds of drunken revellers/sirens etc outside, it was pretty tough to sleep. On the plus side the bar downstairs is pretty decent and the location is a plus. I certainly wouldn't chose to stay again unless the deal was irresistible. Definitely stayed in worse, certainly stayed in better.",nan,nan,ta_s79

trip_advisor,"The Hilton Chicago is a historic property, and it's huge. It's a hotel that handles a lot of convention business and group activities. Being historic and huge don't add up to a good experience in this case. The rooms are hit or miss with respect to whether you get one that's renovated or not. Non-renovated rooms are tired, frayed and jarring in terms of interiors and finishes. Most of the meeting spaces fall into the historic non-renovated category. The staff is for the most part pleasant, but perfunctory. The Front Desk staff is not well organized. I was part of a group of 40, and each person got different answers from the staff regarding room availability and amenities that had been arranged as part of the group rate. Example: With a 12 night stay we were required to check-out after the first 6 nights and check back into the same room for the second 6 nights. Some of my group had it taken care of without any interaction with the Front Desk, some were required to go to the Front Desk for new keys, some were never told this would have to happen and only found out when their keys stopped working on day 6. The room rate came with complimentary wifi and as a HHonors member I should be afforded an upgraded room if available. I encountered a VERY hard sell by the Front Desk at check in to purchase an upgraded Business Room (which included wifi) for another $30 a night. I was already paying $319/night. The young lady at the desk didn't seem to be interested in the fact that I was supposed to already have the things she was trying so hard to sell me. Were it not for the fact that my business meeting were in the hotel I would not be choosing to stay here.",nan,nan,ta_s81

Apparently status with the Hilton points program is needed to get free Internet.Overall the view and the location were nice.,nan,nan,ta_s82
trip_advisor,Grand old building. 14 elevators in the main bank mean service is refreshingly fast. The room itself could benefit from an update. The marble countertop in the bathroom prevents the lid from going all the way back and hence the toilet seat cannot stay raised unless you want to hold it there.

Went back and spoke to another lady and she said would ask the room service. I asked her this was a surprise and she proceed to talk really really loud over the phone about what I wanted.

The location was very convenient to the convention center and the room was nice and quiet but nothing special. The lobby/bar area was really nice and the hotel does have a coffee shop which is always a plus. However, the breakfast in the restaurant was not great and in my opinion was significantly overpriced for what was available and the quality of the food. Overall, the Hilton Chicago is a nice hotel with a convenient location to the convention center and Solider Field. If you will be spending most of your time in other areas of the city the hotel may seem a bit out of the way.",nan,nan,ta_s85
trip_advisor,"The hotel is beautiful and the staff is great. I few things to know:1. The trains are noisy, ask for a room to face Michigan Avenue.2. Search for specials. We booked with a special which included parking ($52 per night), free internet ($12), 20% off food (brunch buffet was $23 per person) and mugs and coffee.3. Location is a few miles from Magnificant Mile and shopping. You will want to take a cab.4. We have Hilton Honors. We are at the lowest status (blue) but since we were signed up for honors, they gave us the 21st floor, which was nice.5. We have a 19 and 21 year old. The rooms are either 2 double or a king. Double isn't comfortable so my husband and son slept on floor.6. We had a room with 2 double beds, but it also had 2 bathrooms which was great. Saved us lots of time getting ready.Enjoy Chicago!",nan,nan,ta_s86
trip_advisor,"My son recommended this hotel to me. He lives in the city and knew I would like it. He was correct. I spent 2 nights in this lovely, quiet hotel. I stayed in a huge room with 2 full size beds. The room was nice, clean, and quite. I was on the 7th floor. Staff was very friendly and helpful. My parking was included in the room rate I arranged and it was very reasonable. The main lobby is beautiful with so much character. This is an old, longstanding hotel. I was asked, at check in, if I wanted to upgrade to a newly renovated room for an additional $40/night. I declined and was very happy with my room. I ran outside so, I did not go to the workout facilities in this hotel. There was a coffee maker in my room, I stayed over Thanksgiving so, did not eat any meals in the hotel. This hotel is easy to access and I will stay here in the future.


Green Features: There was a bag in my room to place all recycle able item in to be discarded.",nan,nan,ta_s87
trip_advisor,"We had a renovated room that had 2 bathrooms, it was absolutely perfect for families. There is a small coffee shop in the lobby and several small gift stores. If you stay here you need to go in the grand ballroom, it is exquisite. The location was good. We took many cabs because you just end up walking too far to get to the main tourist attractions. As a previous reviewer states you can hear the trains at night and we also heard many sirens, but it is a big city. We had a nice view of Lake Michigan from our room and it included a computer and mini fridge. The elevator system is annoying, depending upon which floor you stay on you may have to change elevators several times. We ate breakfast in the Hilton Honors lounge, it was a very minimal breakfast and super crowded. We did like the happy hour better.",nan,nan,ta_s88
trip_advisor,"I stayed over the Thanksgiving holiday and I really enjoyed this hotel. I got one of the Business Executive rooms with two beds and two baths, so it was a nice sized room and the two bathrooms was a big plus. The room had everything we needed including a refrigerator and a safe. The staff was very nice and the hotel was within walking distance to the sites I wanted to see.",nan,nan,ta_s89
trip_advisor,"Our hotel room was very nice but to our surprise we heard the elevated train running during the night and got very little sleep. The train is one block to the west of the hotel, and our room was on the west side of the hotel. The hotel was sold out due to a convention, so we were stuck. Keep this in mind when booking a room!",nan,nan,ta_s90
trip_advisor,"Don't get me wrong, the lobby is exquisite...but the room was small, tired, had absolutely no view, and the bathroom fixtures were old and didn't work that great. Also there was no mini fridge or anything so my pricy leftovers got pitched. I just expected a lot more...even in an older room I feel like a fridge should be pretty standard. I know some rooms are renovated so this hotel is probably worth staying at if you end up in one of those. Service was excellent though. Check in was quick. $12.99 wifi per day. $60 per day parking though...typical for downtown Chicago.",nan,nan,ta_s91
trip_advisor,"I was fortunate enough to be able to stay a week at this facility. From the moment the cab pulled up to the door until the time came to hail a cab to leave, this facility scored 5 Stars in each and every aspect! From the doorman, to the bellhop to the porter, to registration desk, to restaurants, to housekeeping to room service, to amenities offered at this location, never once were we disappointed. We were treated like we were honored guests, and have vowed if we need to return to Chicago, we would stay here. The view was amazing, day and night. You won't be disappointed in this choice. Luxury and Service at its best!",nan,nan,ta_s92
trip_advisor,"Stayed one night at the Hilton Chicago before our flight out. This hotel is impressive and huge; perhaps over 1000 rooms. We stayed on the executive level 24th floor with a lakeview room. Property is across street from Grant Park and Lake Michigan. Parking is in the building, which is rare for Chicago hotels. The hotel is close to the Loop and the downtown shopping & restaurants.Staff was amazing; just friendly and helpful. Our concierge on the 24th floor seemed to be there whether day or night. The only thing they need to work on is the hors'dourve program in the evening and the breakfast. Both need to amp up. Selections were poor. For example, the breakfast has hard boiled eggs, oatmeat, and breads. Any mid-priced property provides a hot breakfast with hot eggs, bacon, sausage, breakfast potatoes, etc. Although is was good, I was expecting a standard hotel breakfast. Also, too many people in that one breakfast room. They need to work on that. Will definately stay at this Hilton again when in Chicago. Once again, the staff is well trained and amazingly friendly. Thanks Hilton Chicago.",nan,nan,ta_s93
trip_advisor,"I recently stayed at the Hilton Chicago while attending a conference. Hotel amenities and quality: This is huge, beautiful hotel with lots of amenities on-site. On the lobby level, there are several restaurants, a coffee shop, and a bar (Kitty O'Shea's) for those who prefer not to leave the hotel. We stayed in a room with two double beds and two bathrooms; it was spacious, very clean, and comfortable. There is a computer in room that allows guests to research nearby dining and entertainment options. Location: The hotel is located in downtown Chicago, within walking distance of a lot of restaurants, shopping, and attractions. The hotel is directly across the street from the beautiful Grant Park and within 5 minutes of the lakefront, where there is trail for running or walking. The walk to the Bean takes 10-15 minutes and with a longer walk (20-25 min) or a short cab ride, you can be on Northern Michigan Ave., where there is a ton of shopping and places to eat. The location of this hotel was probably my favorite thing about it. Service: In the few interactions I had with hotel staff, they were courteous and accommodating. One of my room keys stopped working, but a security guard was up quickly to let me in and there was no problem getting replacement keys. I had to reschedule a tour I was going on and had to ask for a later check-out time to give me time to pack after the tour. The woman I spoke to was very nice and extended my check-out time by an hour at no cost.Downsides: The hotel does have an extensive fitness center with a lap pool and indoor track, but normal folks have to pay for its use. These days, I expect larger hotel chains to offer complimentary access to the fitness center, but I made use of Lakefront Trail to get my workout in instead.",nan,nan,ta_s94
trip_advisor,"A landmark in Chicago. The biggest Hilton hotel I've stayed so far. Standard Hilton Hotel for business travellers. Very good and efficient staff. Rooms cozy, very clean and quite. Continental breakfast is simple and high quality. Very good coffee machine in the lounge ( coffee should be hot, black and strong in the morning ). Very good hotel restaurant. High quality food. Hotel needs renovation but as I heard it's already planned. Very good location for business meetings in downtown.",nan,nan,ta_s95
trip_advisor,"I loved my recent stay at the Hilton Chicago! The place was great, the staff was amazing and the service was well done! It's in a great location and there are plenty of elevators for getting to the different floors. The food options in the hotel are great and there are a great number of restaurants located in the near blocks. The staff can offer great recommendations on site-seeing and for things to do. The are friendly and very helpful. I left a few items and they were so great about helping me get those toiletries sent to my room immediately. I was very pleased with my stay!",nan,nan,ta_s96
trip_advisor,"The service provided by the staff was wonderful, especially that of Darnella the perfect hostess in the executive suite on the 24th floor. She was great about providing information not only about the Hilton but Chicago, as well. The concierge on that floor was also very kind and helpful. He, like Darnella, was friendly and helpful with everyone with whom I saw them speaking. He was closing up one evening and I and a friend were still in the lounge talking while. I expressed disappointment at finding my favorite cookies gone and after casually asking what kind they were, the concierge went to the back and found some for me! It is the little details that make life enjoyable. The housekeeping staff who I encountered in the hallway coming to and from my room were always pleasant and smiling. The staff in the other businesses within the hotel, the jewelry shop and FedEx were some of the nicest people, as well. I mentioned it to one of my colleagues and they said, ""it is the Hilton way."" It had been a long time since I had stayed in a Hilton, but I will be back soon. The rooms were good and that Hilton bed is lovely. I'm thinking of purchasing the feather mattress pad for my own bed. The only things I had problems with were the lack of refrigerator in the the room and the TV stations. The TV armoire had a space in it that appeared to be where a mini fridge would go so I don't know why there wasn't one. And, the way the TV system is set up makes it more difficult than it should be to navigate through the local, cable, and hotel stations. But those are minor issues. It is a huge hotel and food is really expensive, but I have come to expect that wherever I go. The location is great as the hotel is situated on Michigan Ave across from Grant Park. If they allowed dogs I would be back sooner with my Honey girl.",nan,nan,ta_s97
trip_advisor,"I stayed at this hotel for a conference 11/10-11/13/2014 and I was disappointed. The Hotel itself is a beautiful historic building but there were several things that affected the quality of the experience. Upon arrival I checked in and went to the bank of elevators I needed to get to my floor. I inserted my key and it did not work so the elevator would not move. I had to take my luggage back to the front desk again and they reprogrammed the key and gave me another one. I got in one elevator and it did not work again. I went into a different elevator and jiggled the card and finally the elevator moved. Be aware that if you wish to have a fridge in the room it is an extra fee. I had a lakeview room, which was nice to be able to look over Grant Park and the lake. Once settled--I had a long days travels and was looking forward to a good meal, only to find out that neither restaurant was open and my room service screen on the touch screen in my room said room service was closed so I was limited to a basic bar menu if I wanted to eat. The restaurant was all set up but closed down. People were sitting across the way at bar tables, in some cases in chairs eating at coffee tables. People would go look at the restaurant menu and you could see the diappointment on their face when they were told it was closed. Why would you have these facilities closed down when you had a couple of thousand people on site attending a conference? They were referring people elsewhere, which was astounding to me that they were turning away the business. The trade show area apparently had no elevator, and for a vendor carrying supplies in and out, it was a hassle getting big boxes up and down the stairs. There was a non functioning wheelchair elevator there but no ramp or no other way to get into the hall. The night of our reception I noticed elevators that went to the reception area. They were turned off. There were not enough tables to accomodate everyone at the reception. After a long day on their feet I would think they would anticipate people would like to sit. I headed in one evening and decided to order room service. I placed an order at 8:20 and the screen stated it would be 30-45 minutes. Time passed and when I heard nothing I called to confirm they got my order. I was told they did not get the order until 8:40 and that it would be 9:30 and it would be to my room. Okay. Didn't happen. It was 10 before I got it and even then the cobbler was cold. Disappointing. It was items like this that marred the experience. It seemed they were ill prepared and understaffed for the event. Perhaps it is a better experience when there is not an event on site but you would think if anything else they would be better prepared. Beautiful historic hotel, it is a shame it didn't deliver.",nan,nan,ta_s98
trip_advisor,"Beautiful hotel with elegant surroundings but they seem to be having issues with their room keys. I was assigned to a room with a lock that was broken and would take an engineer to fix. I was relocated 3 floors down (this is a huge hotel so there is a lot of walking) and was fine until I went to grab my bag and checkout. My room key didn't work; neither did 6 other women's room keys that I know about (likely there were more than this). Both times I had to call the front desk and wait for security to come. The check out issue was complicated by the fact there were several of us, security was stretched thin, and they have an antiquated system of getting approval to let you into your room. Security calls the front desk and gets permission and if he doesn't get called away for an emergency (this happened) or misread the room number you wrote down (this also happened) you might get into your room within a hour. Try to make your flight late afternoon.",nan,nan,ta_s99
trip_advisor,"While the hotel is very pretty and the rooms are clean and well appointed (although very small). I cannot believe how they nickel and dime you. I was at this Hilton in Chicago Nov. 9-12 for a travel agent conference. I am a Hilton Honors member but they don't give you the normal Hilton Honors perks at this hotel unless you are a diamond or platinum (no bottles of water in my room, no free wi-fi). I didn't even have a fridge in my room and when I questioned this, they said you have to upgrade to the business level to get a refrigerator! While at the meetings, we often could not access any wifi or even a signal on our 4G phones to text clients or reply to emails. For travel agents, this is crazy as we are always needing to contact our clients. You have to go to the first floor lobby to get free wifi! In this day and age and the price of this hotel and being a 4 star property, they should be including free wifi to EVERY meeting group that comes in, if not to everyone that comes in!",nan,nan,ta_s100
trip_advisor,"The front desk staff was very helpful and friendly. The room was nice and clean. It was smaller than some of the less expensive places (like Hampton Inn), but it had a nice view of Lake Michigan and Grant Park. Room service was horrible. They have interactive ordering thru the computer in the room, but it took more than an hour to get the order. When it arrived it was missing items (blue cheese for the wings, bacon on the sandwich, fruit cup). I called Room Service & no one answered after waiting for 20 minutes. So, I called the front desk to complain & they said a manager would call me back, but no one called or brought up the missing items. At check out, I complained again & the front desk gave me a discount off my stay.",nan,nan,ta_s101
trip_advisor,"We had the pleasure of staying here in August for a conference. The hotel is exceptionally located in the Loop just off of Michigan. This means lots of easy walking locations - museums, parks, restaurants, etc. The hotel is quite large, has been well restored and has an amazing history. The rooms on the executive level have been updated and were very nice - the bathroom was a bit cramped, but they are retrofitting an old hotel. We were fortunate to have a room facing the lake - a definite plus. Our price was reasonable as it was a conference rate. We did not eat in the hotel - why would you when you can walk to any number of fantastic restaurants? - so cannot comment on the quality of their food. But drinks in the lobby were reasonably priced and the vibe was good. We would not hesitate to stay here again.",nan,nan,ta_s102
trip_advisor,"This is an older hotel, but very well maintained. The rooms were large, comfortable beds, large bathrooms that are remodeled and nice toiletries. You have to pay for Wi-Fi in your room, hotel parking is very expensive (public parking is right by their parking lot and it was only $25 a night in comparison to $65 they charge). The location is close to downtown shopping which we walked and felt safe even at night. I thought the train noise would bother me, but not a problem.",nan,nan,ta_s103
trip_advisor,"After reviewing all the negative comments about this hotel, I was a little concerned. I had stayed at the hotel before, and thought it was a fantastic place to stay, but that was at least fifteen years ago. This visit was no different that my visits before, except maybe it was better. I am happy to say it is still fantastic! First, you can't beat the location. Secondly, we were greeted warmly by a friendly staff member who checked us in quickly. The lobby is probably the most elegant we have ever seen. The marble, the crystal, the entire ambience is breathtaking. My daughter (16) was in awe. The elevators were quick, and our room (1834) was large, beautiful, clean--everything we could have wanted. I had read the comment about the room being dark until you walk around inside to find a light switch. This is actually true. It's a little weird, but it wasn't much of an issue. We had three windows with a great view and couldn't hear any of our neighbors. The bathroom was beautiful, and I believe it had been recently renovated. The beds are soft, this is true, but we had a wonderful night's sleep. I highly recommend this hotel. It's the real thing--a genuine old hotel, with lots of ambience, in one of the best areas of town.",nan,nan,ta_s104
trip_advisor,"The Hilton Chicago is a nice hotel, but I wish I had stayed a little further north on Michigan Avenue to closer to shops and restaurants. The hotel was very nice inside and you can tell they have remodeled over the years. I did chuckle that the brass in my bathroom was well worn, but functionally it worked.Room size was decent, but the desk location was tough to pull the chair out with a bed in the way. I very much appreciated the Herb N' Kitchen for snacks and Starbucks coffee. The staff was always very friendly and helpful.Overall, it was a nice stay.",nan,nan,ta_s105
trip_advisor,"I have previously stayed here for a conference. This was the host hotel for my business meetings and was very convenient to stay. I upgraded to the business level had a newly remodeled room that was very spacious. Excellent location on Michigan Avenue although a bit south of mag mile. I thought it was a bit expensive, but thats urban pricing when they know you are there for a conference. Weather was unbelievable mild for October. Rooms were kept very nicely cleaned and was sleep quality was good. Was told that this had a high speed internet than base rooms but not sure it really was that high speed. Classic Hotel with fantastic ballrooms. Many movies shot here! Remember the Fugitive with Harrison Ford?",nan,nan,ta_s106
trip_advisor,"Before you book at this nice old Chicago ""gem"", be sure to check the city's event site to see if there will be a race or other event in Grant Park while you are there. We were there to run in a race that started at 6:30A, so it was expected for us. However, other guests didn't know about it & when the race organizers started talking over a PA system at 4:45A on a Sunday those guests were very unhappy. The hotel though, is a bit of a classic. Old & very big, but classy & comfortable. You will see rust on the heater in the bathroom & little things that reinforce the ""old"" part but it is clean & likeable. Easy access to Soldier Field & the museums as well as the Grant & Millenium Parks. And dog friendly!",nan,nan,ta_s107
trip_advisor,"I stayed at this hotel during the PackExpo at McCormick. I have stayed here before and always leave with a sense of awe. The service is fantastic, the lobby and meeting rooms are impeccable and the location is convenient to a great many Chicago landmarks. Make no mistake, this is a historic hotel with first class written all over it. A word to the hotel management. I stayed in room 740. This is directly across the hall from the room used by housekeeping. One morning, I had the opportunity to sleep in (if you call 8:00 sleeping in). The noise in the hallway, clanging stuff, carts hitting the wall next to the head board of my bed, and laughing and joking started early. You need to address this. A word to anyone planning a meeting here. Parking is expensive. And, my personal pet peeve, they charge for their internet connection. I hate this in a hotel. When the prices are this high, it seems like they could afford to throw in a free internet connection.",nan,nan,ta_s108
trip_advisor,"I have stayed at this hotel previously, and the Hilton Palmer House as well as I am in Chicago 2-3 times per year. My primary reason for staying at this Hilton was the fact Kitty O'Sheas was located on the premises and there was alwasy live music. Now there is no live music except on the weekends. With such a big show in town I find it hard to believe that music could not be arranged. Also, although the gym is very nice, the ""spa"" leaves much to be desired.",nan,nan,ta_s109
trip_advisor,"The hotel is lovely and perfectly located in the heart of Chicago. So much was within walking distance that we never used our vehicle during our stay. We requested to be on a high floor, viewing the lake in a corner room and all 3 requests were honored. The room was a little small and we think that might be because we were on a corner, but it was big enough for us. The bed was the most comfortable bed ever and it was a very clean room. The hotel itself and the elevator service was all top notch and there were nice places in it to eat/drink and relax.",nan,nan,ta_s110
trip_advisor,"Stayed at Hitlon for a conference last week. It is a grand old hotel, with two beautiful staircases that lead to a very busy lobby. We had good rooms with nice bedding, good air conditioning and funnily enough two bathrooms. I guess there is a considerable amount of conference room sharing that happens, in my case it made for nice square footage.The shout out is to the concierges. They were a fabulous group of well informed women, that were always happy to help us find our way around.What I loved about this hotel was its proximity to everything on the waterfront park.",nan,nan,ta_s113
trip_advisor,"Stayed here for two nights during a business trip and I can't say enough nice things about this hotel. Located almost directly across from the Art Institute of Chicago, and directly across the park, this is the perfect location for staying in Chicago. It's a short cab ride to McCormick Place and the shops of the Magnificent Mile. However, if the weather's great, you can really walk down Michigan Avenue on the park side all the way to the shops, plus you'll get to see The Bean! The staff was very friendly. Parts of this hotel are old, like the elevators and the lobbies around the elevators, but it doesn't feel run down. Actually, it's quite the opposite; the hotel is clean and well maintained. My room was clean and comfortable, and quiet. The restaurants in the hotel are a bit overpriced, just like most hotel restaurants, but in a town like Chicago, you have plenty of other options. I will definitely be staying here in the future.

trip_advisor,"We chose to stay at this hotel for one night when we took a trip to Chicago to take our 4 year old son to the Shedd Aquarium and Field Museum. This hotel was within a mile of both places, so it was convenient. We were surprised at how beautiful the old style decor in this historic hotel was. We had gotten a room with 2 double beds, and I had upgraded to a lake view room when I booked. I didn't realize that I was also getting a room with 2 bathrooms! I thought that was great, even though it was just my husband, son, and I. That way I got my own bathroom, and the boys got the other! The lake view was just ok, it was like we had to look through a tunnel of two walls to see it. The room was very clean, which I greatly appreciated. I'm not sure if we were in one of the renovated rooms, but it seemed like the decor was updated. Staff was very helpful and friendly. One tip, rather than paying the high cost of parking at the hotel, we used Spothero to find parking nearby for half the price. Overall, we had a very pleasant stay, we would definitely stay here again!",nan,nan,ta_s115
trip_advisor,"We travel quite a bit but must admit we tend to avoid large cities during our travels. But as we had to be in Naperville for a wedding we decided to extend our vacation a few days to spend in downtown Chicago. I booked the hotel several months ago and as I looked every other week or so the price went up and by the week of our stay it had increased by $150 over what I had booked it for. I am very happy with the price I paid and have to say definitely worth the value. Would not be saying the same thing if I had booked it for price rooms were going for the week we stayed. Check in was easy and took all of 5 minutes. I will say lobby was jam packed and trying to get on an elevator with two bags was quite the challenge. We were packed like sardines, this seemed to be the only time during the entire time we were there that elevators were a challenge. Room was quite small with view looking over an alley to another building. Room did have a desk with computer that could be used to research restaurants and other local attractions that Hilton wanted you to visit. If you wanted to search for something else it would cost money, as well WI-FI was not complementary. I fail to understand why this simple amenity is not free.Bathroom was very small which made it very difficult for two people to get ready at the same time. I did find a bug crawling on the shower curtain. Wallpaper was also pealing in several areas. I was also taken back by parking to pay $52 per day seems egregious. Location of the hotel was great in terms of Grant Park and the museums but plan to do some walking if you want to hit the stores up on Michigan Avenue past the river. Walk is just over mile and half. Walk to Navy Pier probably took us about an hour. Red Line station which we took up to Wrigley Field was about 2 blocks away. As well Buddy Guy's Blues Legends is a block away we stopped in briefly one of the nights we were in town but place was packed and after walking all day we did not feel like standing. I regret this decision now. Quick stop cafe in the hotel was nice place to get quick cup of coffee in the morning although there are Starbucks on almost every block. Kitty O'Shea's convenient for a quick drink and not overly expensive. 720 South Bar and Grill was extremely expensive and I felt violated after spending $85 for 6 average drinks that would cost at most $9 any place else. Hotel Lobby was constantly packed the entire time we were there, seemed to be the meeting place for everything. I would stay in this hotel again as long as I booked early and paid a reasonable rate. Probably would also look at alternative travel arrangements. Had we not needed a car for wedding probably would have taken mass transit to and from O'Hare.",nan,nan,ta_s116

The concierge was great and when eating at The Gage where Angie ( the concierge) recommended, we were surprised by free glasses of champagne compliments of Angie! Thank you Angie! Have never been treated like that before!The lack of 5 stars was due to, I, like many reviews was sad that the wifi was not free in the rooms, only in the common areas of each floor. Unfortunately, our check-in gal didn't 'get it' and gave our group of three people (with a roller bed ) a small room when, two other people in our group got a larger room?

It is located about a mile from the Field Museum, Aquarium, and Planetarium, in addition to being in a safe area with lots of restaurant options nearby. The room was clean, comfortable, and had a large bathroom which made it easy for two people to get ready for the day at the same time. I was amazed at how inexpensive the nightly rate was, however, be prepared to pay an exorbitant amount of money to park your car overnight. Even though I am a Hilton Honors member, I still had to pay $52 to park overnight. Ouch! Despite that, I would absolutely stay at this hotel again when visiting Chicago.",nan,nan,ta_s119

Argued with the front desk on the phone because she wouldn't give me the complimentary passcode for wifi, wanted to charge me the 13/day fee. Explained my husband is a diamond member, then rudely gave it me. The Management team should be fired, this Hilton needs a fresh new start.

Everything looks like it used to be very luxurious in the 80's. The pool is OK, but again a bit oldish. As well as the bathroom. Aaand there is no free wifi. I think this is a great hotel for a conference, because they have four floors for this purpose, but if you just want to visit Chicago, look for another hotel.

We were on the 7th floor away from the lift well. the concierge couldn't help us enough and on the last day a late check out with no extra cost wasn't a problem. The rooms are a little tired, but clean. Convenient to all activities and very close to eataly! Bonus was the tea/coffee making facilities.",nan,nan,ta_s123
trip_advisor,"My girlfriend and I stayed at the James hotel to celebrate our two year anniversary. Upon arrival we were greeted by the valet. Who was very courteous. They unloaded our bags for us. Upon check in, we were told we got an upgraded room. The room had a projector in it... Best upgrade ever. The room was very spacious. Beds were comfy! The shower had amazing water pressure. Every time we left the building the staff made it a point to make sure we enjoyed Chicago, suggesting places to eat and see. Absolutely blown away by the service of this hotel. Would stay again.",nan,nan,ta_s124
trip_advisor,"We stayed here while bringing our kids to the city for a few days on spring break. Location was perfect and I was really impressed with the people. The levels of service were excellent. Very friendly, very helpful. I can't say that enough. The rooms were definitely on the modern edge, and our room had a cool view of the skyline. The only real issue we ran across was the thermostat. We tend to like our rooms cooler, and it got on the warm side in there no matter what we set the thermo for. Not worth complaining for, but it was a minor annoyance. Other than that, and what we felt was the salty valet charge ($65), this was a great stay. We will be back, probably without the kids.",nan,nan,ta_s125
trip_advisor,"The James tries very hard to be a hip hotel. Things such as a more plain and modern interior, 325 ml bottles of liquor (for a commensurate price) in the minibar, a shower curtain in place of a door for the hanging closet, gluten free shampoo (!), a sliding bathroom door with frosted port hole window in place of a door, and a flat, wide bathroom sink (not as functional for draining the shaving cream) all add to the feel of the hotel. It was very comfortable, with excellent service. If you like this type of style, you will like this hotel. Good location for River North and Michigan Avenue.",nan,nan,ta_s126
trip_advisor,"So the holiday inn is down the street and they have a complimentary breakfast.With that being said, the james is a decent. Comfy beds and clean. Anywhere you stay in that area is going to be a little noisy because Chicago Fire is nearby.We checked out both the studio and the loft. So the loft faces other rooms within the same building plus air conditioners. The studios are a tad smaller and face the street. The staff is nice. They have umbrellas to borrow. They have a complimentary car which is scheduled on a first come first serve basis. We used it just to go to other points within the city. They do not travel to he airport. We used uber for transport to the airport. The hotel had a coupon which saved me $20. So from the hotel to mdw, it was about$1.67 after applying the coupon.",nan,nan,ta_s127
trip_advisor,"Spent three nights at The James for business. Beware, the rooms can be quirky since it is an older building. Preferred the King Deluxe to a Queen Studio (more space, but tighter fit due to room shape). The gym is okay, but in a basement area that does not have windows. There's something that makes working out more of an experience with natural light. A true boutique hotel. I would avoid the hotel restaurant, David Burke Prime.",nan,nan,ta_s128
trip_advisor,"We all (3 adults, 1 child) really enjoyed our stay at The James Chicago. The room was plenty large enough for our needs, it was very clean, beds very comfortable, quiet, etc. The location worked out great for our trip allowing us to explore the areas off of Michigan Ave, enjoy coffee at Eataly, etc. The concierge was very helpful in recommending restaurants in the area - including a local family Italian place what was quite good. They were also very helpful with the Lil-James service for my nephew (8yr old) in that they brought him cookies, milk, and coloring books as part of a turn down services - which he really enjoyed. We did enjoy breakfast one morning in the restaurant and the food & service were also really good and would be recommended. We did get a great deal on our stay off of one of the Secret deals which made this an even more spectacular deal in regards to the level of services and compared to normal prices, etc. We did drive and found the place is easily, but we did not use their valet (so I can't comment on their services, but if they are at the level of the rest of the doormen, staff, etc - you probably can't go wrong) - rather I parked at a garage right on the next block, just a very short walk away that also had in/out privileges. Overall, I would highly recommend The James Chicago if you're looking for a really nice hotel with a great service team and a location close to Michigan Ave and all the neighborhood has to offer. I look forward to staying again this summer, etc and maybe taking advantage of access to bikes, and other services, etc.",nan,nan,ta_s129
trip_advisor,"Great location. The rooms with two double beds are quite large. The key factor for me is how quiet the hotel is. I couldn't hear my neighbors at all, or hear anyone outside in the hallway. The beds are very comfortable, and you have three different types of pillows to choose from. The towels are very soft, and the bathroom is quite modern. I have nothing bad to say about this hotel, and I would stay here again.",nan,nan,ta_s130
trip_advisor,"My husband and stayed at The James for two nights in April. We booked this hotel through Travelocity's Secret deals and got it for a great rate! The location is great. Just a couple of short blocks away from the L-train and from Michigan Ave. We didn't go to the bar or the restaurant inside the hotel so I cannot comment on them and we didn't spend too much time in the room because there is just so much to see and do in Chicago. However, the bed and pillows were some of the most comfortable I have ever had in a hotel anywhere. My only cons were minor. The room, #803, lacked a regular chair to sit in. There was a small couch and table in the room but you couldn't view the TV from that area. That only left the bed to sit on. A chair with back support is definitely needed in my opinion. Also, the bathroom door had a noticeable squeak that could use some attention. Other than those minor inconveniences, this was a great hotel and we would not hesitate to return to this hotel next time we are in Chicago.",nan,nan,ta_s131
trip_advisor,"Our stay at the James Chicago was excellent. The location was perfect - we could not ask for a better spot. And the service and attentiveness by the staff was wonderful. They sent a complimentary birthday tray, with wine and chocolates, to our room and that helped get the weekend off to a wonderful start. The shower is great, the beds are very comfortable and we had everything we needed. While the rooms are a bit small, there was nothing missing. I would most certainly stay there again on my next trip to Chicago!!",nan,nan,ta_s132
trip_advisor,"I had a staff member walk into my room while I was showering (my family had stepped out to grab food). He did one quick knock as he was letting himself in. He said that I had called for someone to come up. I NEVER did. I told the front desk staff, and they did not seem to care about my worries. I was told that I would receive a phone call right away to let me know why he had came in. I NEVER GOT THE CALL. The next day I went back down to ask about it and was told ""he is very sorry and he was there to program the TV"" It was the most unsafe feeling I have ever had in a hotel. I would not recommend women to stay at this hotel!",nan,nan,ta_s133
trip_advisor,"My husband and I stayed at The James for one night this past weekend and I would definitely stay again. The location cannot be beat - one block to Michigan Avenue and near River North - Eataly, great restaurants, etc. We had a work event at the House of Blues and it was easily walkable. Enjoyed a drink at the Jimmy bar and a delicious brunch at David Burke's the following day. The hotel is filled with unique art and is comfortably modern. The rooms are very nice, albeit a bit stark. The bed was one of the most comfortable hotel beds I've ever slept in. Self parking right across the street, as well as a Trader Joe's.",nan,nan,ta_s134
trip_advisor,"I stayed at the James this past weekend and enjoyed my visit from start to finish. The hotel is beautiful and unique with original artwork in the halls and guest rooms. The staff were knowledgeable, friendly and professional. The hotel had everything we could've wanted. The beds were very comfortable with 3 types of pillows to choose from, the windows opened to allow a nice breeze and the sounds from the street below. The soap and shampoo are amazing! I highly recommend this hotel to anyone who wants a nice, clean, upscale stay in Chicago.",nan,nan,ta_s135
trip_advisor,"We stayed for 4 nights over the Easter Weekend and it exceeded our expectations. We were given a complimentary upgrade to an apartment and it was just incredible, a comfortable King size bed, a living room with a couch separate sitting/dining area, wet bar, large bathroom with a walk in shower. The service was fantastic, yet unobtrusive. Incredible location within minutes walk to shopping, tourist attractions and entertainment districts such as the rush village and with a short walk to Grand and State L train station on the Red Line. We'd stay again for sure.",nan,nan,ta_s136
trip_advisor,"I stayed at this hotel on a business trip for four days. Hotel was convenient to shopping and restaurants. Christine made sure that I had a comfortable and spacious room and upon check out gave me her business card for future visit requests. Hotel and room were very clean. The bellman/doorman service was superior. Special thanks to Bernie, Jose and especially Lucas who always made sure I had ice when I walked back into the hotel. He also provided me with a nice brush and comb set when I asked where I could buy one:-) Overall customer service was outstanding!",nan,nan,ta_s137
trip_advisor,"We pricelined this hotel for the quality and location, so we didn't choose it. But we are glad it was given to us and would definitely stay there again. Check-in was easy, and we got to enjoy some interesting artwork in the lobby area. We were given a studio. The room was beautiful, if you like modern artsy decor. The light fixtures were all different, but they went well together. Honestly, it was the most interesting use of lighting I've ever seen in a hotel. My fiance and I actually spent a moment checking all the switches and dimmers. Same for the furniture. I absolutely loved the wooden end table. Bed was comfy. Bathroom had an interesting sliding door. The bathroom also had sulfate / paraben / silicone free toiletries. As a curly girl, I always pack my own stuff, but this is one of the only hotels that actually had nice toiletries I could use. Nice big bathrobes too.There was also a wet bar. We didn't use the fancy booze, but apparently if you want to pay for it, a bartender will come to your room and make you a drink. There is a minifridge full of stuff that we didn't try.The service was really nice - all employees were the right amount of friendly. I mentioned that we had just gotten engaged (it was true!), and when we came back to our room in the evening, there was a bottle of Martini & Rossi Asti on ice waiting for us. It came with a card congratulating us, which I thought was so sweet. Bartender was able to recommend good beers to us, and let's not forgot that many hotel bars don't even have interesting craft beer. It had a nice relaxed vibe, which was a nice way to finish out the evening.Check-out was late - 3pm, same as check-in. The later check-out was really convenient for my fiance and me, since we'd had a late night! Really, it was all of these little things added up, nice little touches and luxuries that you just don't expect to have at most hotels. I'm so glad that we ended up with the James for such a special weekend; I have a feeling it's going to become our regular Chicago hotel.",nan,nan,ta_s138
trip_advisor,"My room was shaped like Oklahoma with a couch and giant size TV in the panhandle, meaning I was so close to the screen it felt like an IMAX. Lighting is so moody I was glad I'd packed my night vision goggles. (Business trip. Don't ask what business I'm in).There is a well stocked minibar and Pizza Uno delivers there, so I ordered their smallest pizza pie and lived off it for three days, plus another two purely running down the fat reserves it stored around my heart. Deelicious. I think it's the only hotel they deliver to, presumably because their delivery people collapse under the weight of pizza goodness otherwise. And the soaps are nice. Something fancy, I expect. They removed all the evidence off my skin. Like I said, business trip.",nan,nan,ta_s139
trip_advisor,"I stayed at this hotel for a week for business, it's right in downtown and convenient to all the clients I had to visit. The hotel is contemporary, but not too modern - a good medium, clean and nice. The bed is extremely comfortable. I typically don't sleep well in hotels but this made it very easy and relaxing. I actually wonder if they sell their pillows because I would definitely buy some. The room service is so nice, the food is really great. The downstairs restaurant is one of the best steakhouses in Chicago so that's a good topping to the cake. To be honest, the room service workers and the door men are much nicer than the people at the front desk. Everyone is pleasant, but the workers that have to work for tips put the front desk to shame. They should try switching up the jobs. All in all, the hotel is very nice and very accommodating and very comfortable. I visit Chicago often so I will definitely be returning here.",nan,nan,ta_s141
trip_advisor,"Ideally located 1 block west of Michigan Ave., this lovely boutique hotel has a contemporary flare with personal and friendly service. My wife and I, with our two young sons, stayed here in between moving houses. We enjoyed one of the ""loft"" rooms with two beds and a crib. One of the hotel employees helped set up a projector DVD player so our 3 year old could watch cartoons. Room service, though not cheap, was delicious. I would absolutely stay here again.",nan,nan,ta_s142
trip_advisor,"My partner and I come to Chicago several times a year. We love the City. We have stayed in many downtown Hotels. During our most recent visit, we stayed at the James Hotel, who proved to be a Pleasant Hotel Surprise in Chicago."" From the moment of our arrival, when an attendant moved the rotating outer door for us, to check out, the staff could not have been more friendly, professional, and knowledgeable. The room we stayed in was large with a very comfortable king bed (per our request). We loved many electrical outlets scattered along all of the four walls. The TV screen was larger and had better definition than most. And, the hotel really won our hearts when they gave us a 2 PM checkout in response to our phoning to let them know we were running a little late. On the minus side (small points), the bathroom had a strange shower head than lacked vertical tilt; and also we found a lack of counter space to place our Doppler kits. And I found the chair a bit low. But, I would still rate the hotel a ""5"" on a five point scale (""5"" highest) because the plusses so far surpassed the minuses. The hotel is in an excellent location -- Ontario, one block west of Michigan. And again, the service was staff was exceptionally good. We thoroughly enjoyed the lodging experience.T",nan,nan,ta_s143

Overall, great business hotel, but spa was an overpromise to a fatigued biz traveller.",nan,nan,ta_s145
trip_advisor,"The James Hotel in Chicago is a well located and smart place to stay. I was here in January 2015 for 7 nights and I had a very good stay.The James gave me a good room on the 10th floor with some nice decor, furniture and a great bathroom. bed was excellent. The hotel provide hot coffee every morning and there was hot apple cider every afternoon. Plus newspapers. This is all free although you need to get them from the lobby. The only drawback to this is having to get dressed and out shoes on before you can have your first fresh brew of the day! There was also a fresh jug of drinking water in the room every day. There is free wifi.The room was cleaned and tidied every day by the staff, and the reception and door staff were always polite and helpful, and I can't think of anything missing in the room, apart from a coffee maker. I have no idea if The James has a restaurant as I never saw it, nor was I offered any option to eat meals or breakfast in the hotel. So I cannot comment on the food quality or price (if there is any)The James is about two blocks walk form the closest L train station , which is no hardship at all, and I found no trouble getting to and from the hotel to the airport. Although all the door staff seem to assume you will need a taxi every time you leave the place. There are places to eat nearby and you really are very central, close to Millenium Park, The Loop and the main shopping strip. I enjoyed staying here. Thanks to the location you can get anywhere in central Chicago from here.",nan,nan,ta_s146
trip_advisor,"We stayed at The James Chicago about a year ago. We couldn't think of a reason to stay anywhere else for this visit. It's a cool hotel in a fantastic location. The restaurant at the hotel is great. The rooms are clean and nice. Service across the board is excellent. The nightly rate is very reasonable. My only complaint would be the $60 per night valet parking fee. Considering it's only about $140 / night, $60 seems a bit steep.",nan,nan,ta_s147
trip_advisor,"Absolutely loved our stay. We have been coming to the James since 2007 and I don't see that changing any time soon. Always greeted by the amazing concierge when coming upon arrival. Scott has been there since the beginning and just the friendliest person. We always started our evenings at the Lobby bar and sometimes ending them there as well, and every one there is just outstanding. Teyo is there to make you happy with any special requests you might have. Excellent service from entire Staff at David Burke's Prime House. Not to mention that the food here is absolutely amazing!We loved everything about our stay and cannot wait to return to celebrate my 40th at the James Chicago and Prime House!",nan,nan,ta_s148
trip_advisor,"One star only because the staff was extremely polite and very nice! On check in the kids got activity kits in cute orange bags but it was downhill after that. As we got to the room the kids spotted a couple of cockroaches! Yikes ( and yes we do have photos of the litte creepy crawlies as well)! On calling the front desk they mentioned rains could have been the cause, the building has been built in the 1920's and stuff happens.Not a very satisfactory response however they immediately change our room and were very apologetic! On checking in to the next room we got the water started to fill the bathtub for the kids and there was black debris coming out of the faucet. Another call to the front desk and they sent somebody up to fix it immediately - they did get it resolved and said they do not have this happen too often however, in the 9 years he has been with the James it has happend 3 times. We were told the rooms are connected and it was back flow! Did not make me feel good about our stay! Maybe it was bad luck but this was more than I could handle and I did not think I was being in reasonable. Also, this hotel does not have a pool... They send you across the street to use one. All this said the location was fabulous and the only saving grace.",nan,nan,ta_s149
trip_advisor,"I had a wonderful 1-night stay at The James on a business trip to Chicago. I had checked in online prior to my arrival and informed the hotel I'd be arriving late. I received an SMS with my room information, which was a nice assurance that my room wouldn't be given away. When I arrived, the bellman noticed my name on my baggage tags and radioed the front desk to let them know I was there. I was greeted, room key in hand, by an attendant and escorted to the elevators. I couldn't have wished for a better experience, as I arrived after midnight due to a flight delay! The room was very comfortable. I appreciated the abundance of power outlets, the carafe of water on the night stand, and the SmartTV (which seemed to function more like a regular TV without the typical lag of hotel televisions). Checkout was also straightforward, as my folio was left beneath the door in the morning & I enjoyed the complimentary coffee in the lobby on my way out. Overall, I was delighted by the service, attention to detail and hospitality. I will certainly return on future visits to Chicago.",nan,nan,ta_s150
trip_advisor,"This was my first time staying at The James Chicago. The decor of the hotel is great. The king room was of modern decor; very stylish. Excellent house keeping. They returned my dry cleaning on the same day. The room was cleaned daily.I had a bad experience with my meal from room service. The manager immediately took the charge off my bill and offered me another meal at no charge.The food in the resturant was excellent. The filet mignon was cooked perfectly, my meal was outstanding. The king crab and the bass fish was excellent. The ceasar salad that was prepared at the table was fabulous. A must try. You will not be disappointed with the meals in the resturant.I received less that quality service at the bar, the resturant manager immediately handled the situation and sent drinks and desert to my room.The service was so great, I cancelled my reservation at another Chicago Hotel and I will be returning to The James Chicago on Dec. 7, 2014All the staff members are very attentive to your needs",nan,nan,ta_s151

After reading reviews before booking I saw a few people complain about phantom honor bar charges. Those people are just the complaining type, right? Wrong, checked my bill today and sure enough even though we hadn't so much as looked at the honor bar, we were charged. Good thing I had snapped a picture with my phone before leaving the room.....The front desk says they will reverse the charge....its sad that Ill have to check my statement again to find out since I don't trust them.....My advice, stay somewhere else until they get their customer service straightened out....",nan,nan,ta_s152

We were able to walk to everything we needed. 10-15 minute walk to Daley Plaza for the Christmas Market and to the Theater District. Very close to shopping and several great dining options.

Not one complaint and I will absolutely stay with them again when I get the chance.,nan,nan,ta_s154
trip_advisor,"Having stayed at other properties when in the Chicago are - The Fairmont Millennium Park and The Drake - this is the second time I choose The James over other properties. Its location cannot be beat! It is at the corner of Rush and Ontario, a block from all the shopping on Michigan Avenue, a few more blocks from all the high-end stores on Oak Street, to say nothing of all the boutiques on State Street. You are surrounded by a variety of dining options, from their own in-house David Burke's Primehouse, to the Mexican place Su Casa next door, to the legendary Pizzeria Due, to our favorite champagne place, Pops! The rooms are open layout concept with minimalist decor. The studios have a living room and a pantry ideal for making your own drinks (they thoughtfully stock generously-sized spirits and bartender-ready mixing tools). The room is dressed in natural colors, with a floor-to-ceiling mirror, and decorated with modern art pieces (we recognized the Michael Kenna photographs over our bed!). The bathroom is serviceable and eco-conscious utilizing full-sized Intelligent Nutrients bath products (attached to the shower wall). There is - unlike the major chains - free wifi and complimentary distilled water.The property has a gym and a spa that we did not have the chance to utilize. It also offers a complementary car service and bikes, which we also did not have a chance to use - we are walkers and walked everywhere.The staff - from the front desk to housekeeping to the valet guys - is courteous, helpful and super friendly. Everything from upgrading our room and delivering replacements for forgotten toiletries to offering us water bottles as we check-out and chasing after a taxi for us in the rain. The only minor drawbacks are the lack of natural light in the rooms (if you are not on a high enough floor for a city-view) and the elevators - there are only two and they are tiny! If there are two people with sizable luggage in an elevator, you may be able to fit yourself - and only yourself in. Sometimes, this results in having to wait for longer for an elevator to become available between runs (17 floors). Not enough to keep The James from being my go-to hotel when in Chicago!",nan,nan,ta_s155
trip_advisor,"My two sisters and I stayed at The James on a recent weekend getaway to Chicago. We chose the hotel for the location and good reviews on Tripadvisor. Great choice. The James is very central and walking distance to everything in downtown Chicago. We walked to Magnificent Mile for shopping, walked to several great restaurants for dinner, went for a long walk near the lake front and even walked to take the architectural boat tour. The staff at The James was exceptional. Everyone we came into contact with was extremely friendly, helpful and knowledgeable --- this includes the front desk staff, the bell staff, the concierge, and the valet guys. The James is definitely an excellent option for staying in Chicago.",nan,nan,ta_s156

The staff were very accommodating and helpful. Had a great experience at the bar and restaurant and felt very pampered there.",nan,nan,ta_s157
trip_advisor,"Facilities are impeccable. Rooms extremely nice, clean, and well-appointed. But what set apart the James from other group business travel experiences I have had was their personal touch. From the valet parking to the front desk personnel to the concierge services, we found the attention to detail and courteous-yet-not-obnoxious service from the James to be outstanding. Laurelin from concierge services was above-and-beyond helpful to me as I was unfamiliar with Chicago and trying to put together a memorable dining and entertainment experience for a small (12 people) group of people. She was a good listener -- responding quickly and specifically to the needs and interests of our group.",nan,nan,ta_s159

Great location close to the Mag Mile, but I didn't think the room was anything special (except for the various bottles of liquor available for a price in the room bar). Don't get me wrong, it was comfortable but I wouldn't pay that price again. There are similar options near the Mile for a better deal. The hotel restaurant/bar seemed to be a happening place on a Friday night. Housekeeping needs to pay more attention to detail as there was a used bar of soap waiting for us in the shower.",nan,nan,ta_s160
trip_advisor,"Stayed here for two nights on a long-weekend treat. The location is phenomenal if high-end shopping is your thing. For me, I loved that it was within walking distance to dozens of restaurants & bars. The Grand L-train station is just a few blocks south-west and will get you to the fun stuff to the south in no time.The hotel surprised me with an upgrade from a guestroom to a loft. It was on the inside of the building and relatively quiet. The media nook was made for relaxing and had a projector. There are also large TVs in front of the bed and in the small couch + coffee table living room space. The bathroom was spacious and spotless. The soaps, shampoos, and lotion were excellent. Everything inside and outside of the room was impeccably clean. The wet bar is loaded with (probably very expensive) booze. There's a loaded mini fridge inside the wet bar cabinet, as well as an almost-hidden drawer full of snacks below the sink. For the thrifty drinker, Trader Joe's across the road sells alcohol, and The Side Door directly opposite on the corner serves some fantastic beers and cocktails. There are no ice machines. Call the front desk and they will deliver a bucket of ice to your room.Room service from Primehouse was outstanding and a great way to treat yourself. The late night menu was surprisingly good. I had a huge bowl of the house mac & cheese after arriving late and that kept me comfy for the whole night. Primehouse will only seat tables for two when you have a reservation. Or just order room service.All of the staff and housekeeping were very pleasant and helpful. My only quibble is that the room's thermostat display was a super-bright blue light. I had to fold up some pieces of paper to hang over it because it faced the bed. That aside, I'm definitely going to stay here again.",nan,nan,ta_s161
trip_advisor,"I recently stayed at The James for a 3-day conference. I opted to stay here instead of the conference hotel which was a mere two blocks away. I had a king suite which was lovely and spacious. I had a corner room so it was nice and quiet and far from the elevators. The windows looked out into a courtyard so the only view was that of the other rooms that also looked into the courtyard. It wasn't an issue for me as I was gone from the room all day. My room had a sitting area with a small couch, chair, coffee table and flat screen TV. The couch was slightly uncomfortable if you wanted to lean back and lounge. It needed a big pillow but that was only a minor inconvenience. There was also a wet bar with a small refrigerator. The king bed was super comfy with lots of pillows. There was also a flat screen TV in the bedroom area and small bench along the window. Beware the bed frame as I smacked my shin into the corner in the middle of the night. After a long day at my conference, it was great to come back to The James and lounge on the comfy bed!I also took advantage of the Asha spa for a one-hour foot massage before I left town. I would highly recommend Marvin for your foot massage. He did a wonderful job!I had dinner one night at David Burke's Primehouse at the hotel...foie gras appetizer, 40 day ribeye, parmesan popover, mac'n cheese and cheesecake lollipops. Delicious!The James is ideally located to many restaurants and shopping and I would definitely stay here on my next trip to Chicago.",nan,nan,ta_s162

It contained all the amenities of a great place to be away from home--up-to-date gadgets, fully-stocked bar and snacks, awesome shower, and a spacious room. Room service was on-time and the food was hot and tasted great! The location of the James is in the midst of all the action downtown, just down the road from the RedHead Piano Bar, great shopping on Michigan Avenue--being near shopping is always a plus! We would definitely stay there again!",nan,nan,ta_s163

The shower curtain is literally a gigantic towel; yes, that's the material of the curtain. The soap and body lotion have a disgusting smell.The person who designed the sink should be banned from designing anything again. I can't even move my hands under the water because there's no room and because it's big and square, all the dirty water stays there.",nan,nan,ta_s164

We looked at this hotel mainly because of its great location and the look of the hotel seemed to be simplistic but very nice, and we were not disappointed. We traveled here to celebrate my friend's birthday so we spent a little extra to stay here and now I'm not sure if I could stay anywhere else! The rooms were simple and modern, the staff was beyond friendly and helpful, and the location is absolutely perfect. STAY HERE, trust me, you won't regret it!",nan,nan,ta_s165
trip_advisor,"Really good looking interiors, contemporary furnishings in room, king-size bed with fluffy white comforter wrapped in white sheets--for cleanliness, full bar, strong hot shower, lovely service all around (front desk, doormen, valets, room service), great downtown location, around the corner from Eataly Restaurant complex AND five minute drive to the Navy Pier. Would definitely stay here again. Only cons: Electronics! You can't rent movies on TV, the in-room internet was very slow, phone system needs updating--kind of clumsy.",nan,nan,ta_s167
trip_advisor,"From the moment we stepped into The James Chicago, it was an exceptional experience. Our trip was planned as an Anniversary celebration for me and my wife, and when we checked in we told them that. And they upgraded us to a Loft - a much nicer room than we initially had booked. And with a separate area/private screening room with a Japanese bed and projector. As movie lovers, this was the perfect thing for us, to be able to watch a DVD from the comfort of our room on a big screen at the end of each day. It was awesome.The staff was exceptionally friendly and nice and we received great service all around. Laurelin Hefter, one of the concierges, was great and gave us some amazing recommendations throughout the city. We were very happy with all the options she provided to us and discovered some new places all because of her.We will be enthusiastically recommending the hotel to our friends, families and colleagues and they've made some lifelong fans. Hope to visit again in the not too distant future!",nan,nan,ta_s168
trip_advisor,"Stayed the James for a meeting recently and was expecting the hotel to be up to the standard of their Miami property which is very cool and creative. Unfortunately, the hotel felt tired and worn. The furniture in the lobby was not kept up and looked dirty. The guestroom loose furniture was not very comfortable especially for the business traveler. The service was very good though and the staff was really friendly and welcoming. They did call me 15 minutes late for my wake-up call but aside from this the service was very good.",nan,nan,ta_s169
trip_advisor,"Our family of 3 (includes a 10-year-old) found the James convenient and lovely. The rooms were spacious enough for the 3 of us. The bell stand was excellent and even helped our lost Uber driver find us. And, when needing a cab on a busy Friday night, THEY offered to bring us to our dinner location in the hotel car. The location is the real selling point. The rooms are nice for an aged building, but not over the top. We had a great dinner at David Burke's restaurant. We'll stay here again. I highly recommend the James.",nan,nan,ta_s170
trip_advisor,"What was this lucky find, a very personalised and hospitable hotel in the US! Normally they are impersonal and staff seem so busy that one feels kinda intimidated to ask for anything! But not at The James! From arrival with the Bell Men, the Check in Staff, Room Service, Housekeeping, the Restaurant staff, all were so welcoming and warm! It felt like one was in Asia, not the US! Well done. Have to specifically mention Bill Marcella, Chief Concierge. He really knows how to take ownership of a Guest request, and deal with it. I had some couriers to do and he just helped out, without hesitation, and did it all for me. Thanks, Bill!",nan,nan,ta_s171
trip_advisor,"This hotel was designed to please the younger more hip traveler but there are some flaws. Dark hallways are not young and hip. They're just dark. Not having Public Television in their cable package is not young and hip, just frustrating and annoying. Having a desk attendant who never heard of Public Television, again not young or hip. Finally, having a light bar over the bed may look young and hip but it was either totally on or off and had an off and off switch on only one side of the bed. Don't they ever have couples stay? To really be a 4.5 star, the hotel needs to ramp up.",nan,nan,ta_s172
trip_advisor,"A great hotel for a drunken party? Probably. For a business guy who wants to get work done? Absolutely not. No desk in the room, no work chair. Lighting is awful for productivity, no bed side lamp for reading. Windows are single lane, and even on the 12th floor street was very loud.That said, the hotel is in good condition, and the staff were unfailingly excellent, I just think in not in the target market for this hotel.",nan,nan,ta_s173
trip_advisor,"We recently returned from our first trip to Chicago a long weekend at The James.The good stuff, Superb location handy for everything,nice rooms with very comfortable beds, very friendly staff.We had a couple of issues:We asked for more tea to be put in the room at least four times before eventually giving up and going over the road to buy our own!The hotel advertises a courtesy car, every time we asked if it was available it was not. One evening we asked the doorman when it was available and he said that he did not know they had one!The cocktail bar is not open every night.These may be small points but at this price they are not acceptable.",nan,nan,ta_s174
trip_advisor,"My brother chose the James for his birthday getaway because of its location and its association with David Burke Primehouse, which is where we celebrated his 40th. The location is phenomenal, just a block off Michigan Ave in the heart of everything you want to be near. The atmosphere of the hotel is pleasant and modern, with a chic vibe that is a tad worn on the ends but not in a distracting way. Rooms have lovely amenities, seating options and very comfortable Simmons Beautyrest mattresses. There's a pillow menu. They are clean and pleasant.But what was really tremendous - moreso than any other hotel in which I've stayed - is the dedication and friendliness of the staff. From housekeeper to front desk to doormen to our bellman, Jamie, each and every person we met went above and beyond to make our stay not only comfortable but absolutely perfect. Jamie even slipped a note into my shopping bags for me to find after I returned home, thanking us for our stay, knowing I wouldn't find it until I unpacked. I cannot recommend The James highly enough. Yes, it might be a bit much to spend for some budgets - it stretches mine - but for this quality of service it's well worth it. We will absolutely return to the James and make it our home away from home in Chicago.",nan,nan,ta_s175
trip_advisor,We chose the James for our 4 day stay in Chicago on the basis of reviews on the site and were delighted with our choice. I would sum up The James by saying it is compact (by US standards) and with all necessary facilities and nice rooms and a very good restaurant (David Burke's steak house) and well situated for big-time shopping but what makes it stand out is the quality of the service and its personal nature. It made it a real pleasure to stay there. The front of house team are exceptionally good - especially the concierge desk of Bill and Laurelin. They were both happy to ensure we got the trips we wanted and the advice we needed.,nan,nan,ta_s176
trip_advisor,"Lovely hotel, right in the middle of town. We stayed for the marathon, and its convenient for the start and finish. Rooms spotlessly clean, very friendly and helpful staff.Only downside was the restaurant was perpetually booked out, and the prices are 5 star, but all in all, worth a stay.Very comprehensive mini bar and snack list, which even included a nice bottle of red wine, pain killers, lots of snacks and an intimacy kit, I'll leave you to guess....",nan,nan,ta_s177
trip_advisor,"My wife and I just returned from mid-week 25th anniversary getaway to Chicago. We picked The James because of its central location to shopping, dining and attractions. The staff at the James was outstanding - they went out of their way to make our anniversary special. Laurelin (the concierge) booked at great last minute anniversary dinner at Sepia and then had champagne and raspberry truffles waiting in our room for our return. It was a very special treat, she even told the restaurant it was our anniversary.We booked a king room with breakfast included. The room was very nice, modern decor, comfortable bed, functional bathroom with great hot water / pressure. We had great drinks in the bar upon arrival (a little pricey) and breakfast in the morning in the restaurant. Breakfast was very enjoyable - the bill was a bit more then the coupon was worth but it was worth it. The lobby staff was very helpful with information and suggestions. Something I doubt most people recognize is the hotel will give you a ride to local destinations when the SUV is available. It was great to step out the door into a car to get a ride to dinner and the train station. The driver was very friendly and informative. Overall we had a great trip to the James. We will be back.",nan,nan,ta_s178
trip_advisor,"We stayed four nights at the James after a three week roadtrip and, boy, was this the perfect way to end that vacation. Staff was friendly, courteous and very helpful, the room was very nice and clean and the hotel was small enough to feel personal and convivial. A unique and personal experience. Location was also great, just off the Magnificent Mile. The only downside was the automatic minibar where if you moved something, they'd charge your account. Bad for someone like me who likes to bring their own (craft) beer to the hotel...",nan,nan,ta_s179
trip_advisor,"Reserved a King Suite and found it to be disappointingly Spartan and as if somewhat had raced to get the suite clean. Lampshades were tilted, picture frames askew and a general tiredness to the furnishings. Gone the entire next day, came back to a room that had not been cleaned. When I called on the ONE phone that worked in the room, the individual explained rather curtly that, '' . . . housekeeping starts on the lower floors.'' When there was no response from me, she asked, . . ""Do you need someone to come up there now?"" I requested that someone just bring some fresh towels. The gentleman who came to the door a few minutes later was very apologetic, towels in hand, and asked if there was anything else that could be done. The remainder of the stay was uneventful, staff were very friendly and the room was cleaned. Went to the restaurant on two mornings, food ok, service polite but very slow. So if you're in a hurry, better go some place else.",nan,nan,ta_s180
trip_advisor,"This is the second time I've stayed at The James and we had a great time! The hotel is in a perfect location (Starbucks and Trader Joe's across the street!) and it's easy to get to anything in Chicago. The staff is phenomenal! From booking my birthday dinner reservations at a trendy spot for me months in advance to arranging a car to get us back from a concert at the United Center - everything was awesome. Very friendly, knowledgeable, and professional. The staff at David Burke's restaurant downstairs is equally amazing! They remember your name (we were there 5 nights) and love to chat. The beds and pillows are AMAZING! Furniture is a bit uncomfortable, but we didn't spend much time in the room anyway. Looks great though! Nice little sink/bar areas. One negative is do not get a room facing inside - get one facing the street. I've stayed in 2 outside rooms and they are perfect. Those rooms are quiet. In the inside rooms (of which we tried 2) unfortunately, you either hear the regular elevator or the service elevator. Also, Saturday night was a wedding and the music was SO LOUD! We were on 14th floor too. The staff was kind enough to let us sleep in an outside room that night and not move our stuff. That never happens! Hotels usually make you haul all of your things to the new room. They were wonderful. I recommend this hotel to anyone!",nan,nan,ta_s181
trip_advisor,"I couldn't have been happier with a hotel experience than the one I just had with The James in Chicago. The staff was notably friendly, helpful and accommodating, and extremely knowledgeable about local attractions, dining, and transportation (every food recommendation was excellent and they were great at picking good places with specific price restrictions).The room itself was nicely made up, attractive, very clean. Best of all, though, were the mattresses and stylish-yet-functional bathrooms. That's probably the best I've ever slept in a hotel!",nan,nan,ta_s183
trip_advisor,"Stayed at The James for a week with my husband on our first couples vacation to Chicago. We loved the central location of hotel and how we could walk to so many public attractions, shopping and restaurants. The staff were very friendly and helpful. I had booked the stay in advance but had some questions about logistics. Laurelin helped us with our questions and everything went smoothly. We would definitely stay here again.",nan,nan,ta_s184
trip_advisor,"I just returned from my Chicago getaway and stayed at The James three out of four nights. I could not be happier with my choice and wish I would have stayed the 4th night as well.Location is excellent for walking to nearby shopping and restaurants. There is a bus stop about a block away. There are several taxis nearby at all times, so you'll never be waiting more than a minute or two for one to show up. The staff was absolutely wonderful the entire time. Very helpful with food/drink suggestions, directions, and everyone was very friendly and professional.My room (1717) was high enough I didn't hear a lot of street noise. An occasional siren or honking, but certainly not enough to wake me at any point during the night. The view wasn't exceptional, but was nice at night. The room was super clean and well-kept. Housekeeping came daily while I was out and about, so I came back every evening to a clean room and refilled water. The beds were nice and comfortable. The room decor was simple and modern. This will be my definite go-to hotel for any future stays in Chicago.",nan,nan,ta_s185
trip_advisor,"Great location, appealing clean decor, green and healthy offerings, exceptionally friendly and attentive staff, comfy bed, art on the walls. Very well stocked, way over-priced mini bar. Did not eat in the restaurant, but the conference food was good to my taste (though too ""healthy"" for some attendees, e.g. scambled egg whites and turkey bacon for breakfast, kashi bars for morning snack, lots of salad.)",nan,nan,ta_s186
trip_advisor,"Stayed a few nights for a conference that was at the hotel. The decor and furniture were modern and comfortable. Very Eco-friendly : the linens, bath products (gluten free shampoo!), tap water in a carafe instead of plastic bottled water - but the shower faucet was leaky (wasting water!). The bed, pillows, and other furniture were very comfortable. The room service menu was limited, but available 24/7. Only complaint was the street noise, although I suspect higher floors may not have this problem (I was on 5)",nan,nan,ta_s187
trip_advisor,"Located just a few blocks of Michigan Avenue north of the river, this hotel is ideally situated. It's far enough off the beaten path that you aren't fighting the pedestrians and tourists, yet close enough to the best shopping on Michigan Avenue and State Street. There are plenty of fantastic restaurants within walking distance.The exterior of the hotel is unassuming - big, brick, old. But when you step into the lobby, you are transported to a modern urban oasis. The space is bright and warm with modern lines, dark wood, comfortable leather chairs, and impressive art installations that rotate regularly.Every single staff person I encountered was a joy - helpful, friendly, professional.The hotel even has a complimentary luxury SUV that will drop you off anywhere you want to go within a predetermined radius of the hotel.I stayed in a king bedded junior suite looking out onto the courtyard. The decor was bright, clean, subdued and modern. The bed was exceedingly comfortable, bathroom was a bit cozy but well lit and well appointed with plenty of counter space and a large shower.The sofa was hard and uncomfortable to sit on for an extended period of time, but I didn't visit Chicago to sit in my hotel room watching TV.I found it odd that a junior suite didn't have a desk or workstation...The hotel's fitness center was fairly extensive - as a regular gymrat, I was impressed with the selection of equipment. I was able to get in regular workouts.I would definitely stay here again.",nan,nan,ta_s188
trip_advisor,"The James is an interesting property in a city that's famous for design. Extensive and classy renovation but at times form seems to trump function. Like why have ice buckets when there are no ice machines? Or chairs that may look stylish but are seriously uncomfortable. (Chairs inbthe conference rooms are only slightly better, with low backs and very little padding that make forbade long day.)On the other hand the service is impeccable. They seemed happy to deliver ice (I later found out that they do have ice on some floors-like the 6th--in insulated chests, but that's apparently a secret), as well as memory foam pillows, a very nice touch. All the staff is interacted with were both friendly and helpful. And the location is great.",nan,nan,ta_s189
trip_advisor,"I enjoyed our stay at this hotel. It wasn't perfect, but the bed was super-comfortable and the staff was very responsive to any issue we brought up, as well as friendly. Two complaints-- a smell (likely of cleaning chemicals) upon entering the room and no vegan items on the restaurant and room service menus (something that doesn't matter to everyone but does to me), but the location is great and the bathroom very nice. On the whole, I would gladly go back.",nan,nan,ta_s190
trip_advisor,"This was our first time staying at The James Hotel. We were very impressed with the professionalism of the staff and cleanliness of the rooms. The hotel is located just off the Magnificent Mile, close to both upscale and believe it or not, outlet shopping. Lots of restaurants within walking distance, everything from ultra expensive to McDonald's. The decor is contemporary and rooms very comfortable, with a small refrigerator, coffee pot and snacks for purchase. The beds are heavenly! Best night's sleep I've had in a long time. Check-in and check-out time is 2:00 pm, which made it nice on both the day we arrived and the day we left. All in all, a great place to stay.",nan,nan,ta_s191
trip_advisor,"I am in Chicago fairly often and have stayed at The James regularly since first discovering it. The understated elegance of the place has always impressed me. It's not flashy but everything is well designed and extremely comfortable. Last time I was there I forgot my my keys in my room on departure, and they were found for me and shipped back more or less instantly by the concierge Laurelin Hefter. Just cemented their reputation as my favourite hotel in Chicago.",nan,nan,ta_s192
trip_advisor,"The James Hotel Chicago is the Best all-around hotel in Chicago! The location can't be beat - great restaurants and bars nearby, shopping on the Mag Mile, close to public transportation. But what really makes this hotel the best is their staff and the service they provide. Their staff has always been friendly, even when I've booked a room through a travel website rather than directly with them. They're always ready to make your stay better than expected, whether giving recommendations on places to go, making your room more comfortable, or taking you to your destination in their courtesy car. The James staff is truly committed to exceptional customer service. I'm already planning my next stay!",nan,nan,ta_s193
trip_advisor,"I just stayed at The James for a girls weekend and it was great. I do not think you could be in a better location! We walked everywhere and did not need a taxi at all! They have bikes, but you must reserve ahead of time. The concierge is very helpful as well. I had read a review on TripAdvisor that this was a fantastic location and it is!!!The room was nice, the service was great and the location was perfect.",nan,nan,ta_s194
trip_advisor,"But with The James it is a huge advantage. I'm not very familiar with the city but this turned out to be about as close to everything as it's possible to get...and still be quiet and peaceful.A friend who had lived in Chicago was visiting the city a few weeks later and I recommended The James. He knew the property by name only. He reported back that it was the best location that any visitor could wish for - which coming from an ex-resident confirmed what I'd thought. But, location is not everything that makes for a happy stay. Fortunately The James offers more and it's staff go the extra mile to make sure your stay is as comfortable as possible. From the door staff to the housekeeping service they could not have been more helpful.I later discovered this to be true of other Denihan Group hotels. I guess it's the training.The suite was spacious and beautiful with little extras - like a 'welcome' note and turn down service - that go to make a stay memorable. However, these days we expect comfort, clean functional bathrooms and crisp linen and ample towels as the norm and we can even pick our hotels by location (thank you Google Maps). The James provided all of this. During our stay we looked into five rooms on our floor and all were of the same high standard.So what makes a difference to the experience comes down to the staff. The staff at The James were not just the icing on the cake - they were also the cherry on the top.It really isn't all about location....We shall certainly come again.",nan,nan,ta_s195
trip_advisor,"Just returned home from a week in Chicago and we stayed at this great hotel. We booked the James based on reviews which we had read on tripadvisor as we didn't know the area. What a great location to find ourselves in. We had our pregnant daughter in law with us on holiday and we were thinking we would have to use a taxi most of the time but this was not the case as we were in walking distance of some great shopping, great restaurants and some bars. The staff at the James are so helpful and friendly and would do anything for you to make your stay enjoyable. A special mention to the housekeeping staff who did a wonderful job on our room everyday. From check in to check out I can honestly say we had no complaints about the hotel. Just a little bit of advise to the bar manager, extend your last call at the bar as we did notice a few disappointed guests looking for a drink on their return back to the hotel at nightime, although they all had a mini bar in their room, but sometimes its nice to have your nightcap before you go to your room. I would have no hesitation recommending the James to any of our friends and family and we would book it again if we decide to return to Chicago.",nan,nan,ta_s196
trip_advisor,"The building was probably constructed as Howard Johnson's or similar as, although it's hip, cool and trendy, it doesn't have the build quality of other hotels for the same price locally. The beds and linens are very comfy but I do miss the turn down that was standard last year but the sofa in the suites is an instrument of torture so you mostly spend time on the bed. Great staff and location, go for a fun weekend not an extended stay.",nan,nan,ta_s197
trip_advisor,"Had a really exceptional stay at the James in Chicago. First of all, the hotel is located in the miracle mile shopping district. I enjoyed being so close to so many unique shops and national chain luxury stores. The hotel is absolutely unique. I found that the hotel staff went out of their way to make sure our stay was comfortable. I found the traffic a bit busy in front of the hotel, however, the bell staff worked hard to clear waiting cars. I loved the turn down service, and the hot pastries left on my pillow in the evenings. It is so nice to return to the room and find subdued lighting and a nice treat. They have really exceptional bath products and fluffy towels. I would recommend this hotel to anyone travelling to Chicago. One tip, make sure you eat downstairs at the steakhouse, it was one of the best dinners that I've had.",nan,nan,ta_s198
trip_advisor,I really enjoyed this unique hotel! I went here with my son and only stayed one night but it was still great! They have a driver that will take you one way where ever you want to go (within reason) and he was very friendly! The location is super! We went to the Eataly which I highly recommend! The beds are comfy and you have a free bottle of water on the table waiting for you. The front desk people were very nice too. I'd stay there again! :),nan,nan,ta_s199
trip_advisor,"My husband has to travel to Chicago for business often and sometimes I fly in for a long weekend. One such weekend we stayed at The James and it has become one of our favorite hotels. It is a great location. There is only valet parking but it is located within walking distance of shopping, eating and lots of tourist attractions so you will probably never even ask for your car. Rooms are very comfy and the service was good. The number of excellent restaurants within walking distance is vast. We did get charged twice for valet so be sure and check your bill before leaving. They quickly corrected it when we showed them. If you have never stayed down town Chicago be prepared to hear sirens and vehicles all night.",nan,nan,ta_s200
trip_advisor,"my husband and I were going to Chicago on business and we decided to go a couple of days early to celebrate my 50th birthday and booked at the The James Chicago after reading trip advisor reviews and I am so happy that I did. I advised them that it was my birthday and upon arrival, there were cupcakes in the room to wish me a good one. The room was very modern and comfortable, the hotel was close to everything you could possibly imagine. I had sent a note prior to arrival indicating that we would arrive early and if you could check in early it would be appreciated, and they filled that request. Every single employee was willing to help with any possible question that we could possibly have. All very friendly and made me feel welcome. I could not have hoped for better. We left the windy City and agreed that we would be back and we will definately be back at the James.",nan,nan,ta_s201
trip_advisor,"It was our first stay here and we stayed in the king bed apartment with the bedroom and living area separate. We had a great view of the city at night. Loved that the windows open as I love fresh air. I also loved that the room was separated as we were traveling with an infant and a 4 yr old. The infant slept with us and the 4yr old on the requested roll away bed. Room had plenty of space which was great and the price was not too bad I thought, though it was the day after Labor Day. My favorite part though was the 2pm check in and check out time. Finally, a hotel that you can spend a whole 24 hours a day in. Plus our flight wasn't till 6pm so that really helped. Only downside is the $60 a day for parking. Ouch!!",nan,nan,ta_s202
trip_advisor,"I enjoy boutique hotels and was rather disappointed with The James. Let's start with the good. I found it to be a convenient location, 1 mile walk from Art Institute and very close to the beaches and lake shore walks. It is around the block from Eataly, which was hands down one of the best culinary experiences of my life (it's a must). The door men were wonderful as were the young men at the front desk. I truly appreciated the fresh, cold water available at the front desk (I explored the city almost entirely by foot, so the water was much needed). The AC in the room worked extremely well. We like it cold. The not so good - the unconventional art in the lobby is very disjointed. With no theme connecting the decor it feels like an odd space that you don't want to spend much time in. It's as if someone said, well these are all strange things to display so it will look cool. But it doesn't. Concierge seemed too busy to assist me, wasn't welcoming or hospitable. Elevators are very slow. The couch in the room was for looks only, it was too uncomfortable to sit on. There was only one night stand for the bed. Awkward layout made it a not-so-comfortable room. Not the worst place but I will stay elsewhere next time I visit Chicago.",nan,nan,ta_s203
trip_advisor,"We held our wedding reception here 4 years ago, and returned for our 4th anniversary for a night's stay. Everything was as we remembered it, though they now carry another toiletry provider (used to be Kiehl's products, it is now something else. The products weren't quite as good, but they were still very nice). The hotel overall is fantastic, everything is meticulously maintained and the staff make an amazing effort to ensure the comfort of their guests. We dined at David Burke for dinner, since the kitchen catered our wedding reception. The steak was even better than we remembered it, and our server was amazing. It was a GREAT experience, and we can't wait to come back again another year to celebrate. Can't recommend The James enough.",nan,nan,ta_s204

trip_advisor,"The location could not be better --- but the service is lacking completely. We stayed at the hotel the weekend of July 26. We had prepaid for an upgraded room and then been upgraded from that. Check-in is at 3 pm - but our rooms weren't ready until 7 pm. The front desk made constant excuses and then gave us cards for free drinks in the bar. We went to the bar to use the drink tickets and were told they were no good after we ordered $60 worth of drinks for 4 people. When we finally got to the room it was apparent the ventilation/AC wasn't working. The front desk staff and management did very little, even the next day. Our valet was comped. I did the online review and was honest and then Christine Helin, the front desk mgr, immediately followed up with an email, apologized, and said she was sending a certificate for a free night. That was several weeks ago and we have received NOTHING. I have followed up with her on telephone and email and there has been NO response. Pretty apparent this was just lip service.The location of this property is incredible. I just wish the service and decor and cleanliness matched the amazing location.",nan,nan,ta_s209
trip_advisor,"I stayed at the James Hotel Aug 6-8. The hotel was able to provide an early check in with 15 minutes of my arrival. The hotel is of the minimal persuasion, but that is of my liking. My room was on the 8th floor away from the elevators. I was able to sleep restfully each evening. Complimentary newspapers (Wall Street Journal, USA Today and Chicago Tribune) were available each day. The Steakhouse is on the expensive side within the restaurant, but the location is outstanding being one block off of the Magnificent Mile. Complementary rides within the CBD are available through the front desk. Bicycles are available to use as we'll complementary. Water (triple filtered) is available in your room (also complementary). I was pleased the hotel as a 2:00 pm check out, yes 2:00 pm! This was greet to wrap up a noon conference then return to the hotel to check off. The front desk was very helpful. Taxis ready if you need them. I would recommend this hotel!",nan,nan,ta_s210
trip_advisor,"Stayed at The James for a 3 day business trip. I felt like someone special from the time I got out of the taxi. When I had arrived, I realized that I lost my driver's license somewhere from the time I got on the plane until check-in when the associate asked me for ID. The concierge was very helpful in providing me with phone numbers to call to report lost and found. She was very sympathetic and was full of positive energy, that I didn't let it spoil the whole trip. The room was very comfortable and a little eclectic. Had a very hip ambiance. View was not so great as I was looking at the back of another building. Also, I was a little annoyed that I was charged $40 for damaged linen (fitted sheet only). Room rate was not bad because I got the conference rate.But, the hotel hosted the conference very well. And felt special even when checking out and hopping into the taxi to get back to the airport.",nan,nan,ta_s211
trip_advisor,"My stay at the James, in June was made more pleasant by the friendly and efficient staff. The room was comfortable with good linens, towels and amenities. This is not a luxury hotel, but it is a welcoming and comfortable one. The location is perfect for shopping, museums, dining, etc. Laurelin Hefter, the concierge, was most helpful and the restaurant staff made dining a treat. I hope to return many times.",nan,nan,ta_s212
trip_advisor,"This was my 1st time in Chicago and this hotel helped make it more than a work trip. Room was very clean and comfortable, staff was attentive, food was delicious! I would definitely stay here again. Our conference was held at the James and everything was well done. Our breakfasts and lunches were wonderful! And the one night we had dinner was magnificent! Order the filet. It was cooked to perfection!",nan,nan,ta_s213
trip_advisor,"We stayed at The James because they have a decent military discount, which was greatly appreciated. The staff was all friendly but didn't go out of their way to make us feel welcome. I had talked to the front desk a couple of days before our arrival to let them know we were in the city as a way to keep my friend's mind off of the fact that her husband had just been deployed to the Middle East and would be gone for over a year. I had hoped they would help us 'celebrate' and I even asked about paying for an upgrade, but they were not helpful at all. Our room was at the very end of the hall and looked over a roof, but because we weren't in our room much, it wasn't a huge deal. The bathrooms are nice and all of the mirrors are wonderful for two women to get ready! The location is ideal if you are planning on shopping on Michigan Avenue and also using the subway.We had a nice time, nothing spectacular, but I would stay again if the price was right.",nan,nan,ta_s214
trip_advisor,"Overall I had a very good stay at the James. It was in a very convenient location, and I had efficient and pleasant interactions with staff. I also appreciated the amenities and wish I could have taken advantage of the spa. A discount coupon for the spa and a mini area map included with the room key were nice touches. The hotel artwork and decor were also a change from the more typical sterile hotel environments. Definitely recommend this hotel.",nan,nan,ta_s215
trip_advisor,"I enjoyed the stay, the location and the room. The noise, however, was terrible. We were placed in a king room on the fifth floor and heard a lot of street noise all night.After we arrived home from our 3 night stay, we found out that we were charged twice for the entire stay. I called the hotel to inquire about the charge so they could remove it and they said that they only charged me once. I had to go through a chargeback process with American Express in order to get the charge removed. When I spoke with American Express, they confirmed that the hotel had ran my card twice within seconds of each other. An unfortunate and inconvenient end to an otherwise nice stay.",nan,nan,ta_s216
trip_advisor,"Being one of the few hotels with rooms available in the mag mile area when I booked, I didn't expect too much from this place. It really surpassed my expectations. Service was superb, room was clean, in good condition, well stocked. Great beds & linens. The location couldn't be better. The only thing I would complain about is that I would have liked them to have a preferred parking garage, and to offer a parking voucher for at least 1 night's parking fees. $115 for 2 nights of parking can really cut into a trip budget. Regardless, I would definitely stay here again.",nan,nan,ta_s217
trip_advisor,"My husband and I celebrated our anniversary at The James over a 3 night stay. I can honestly say we had a wonderful experience. Even before our stay, the concierge, Laurelin, was incredibly helpful and kind in setting up our dinner reservations, making excellent suggestions as to places that fit the type of food, atmosphere and budget we wanted. Nothing was too much to ask for, nothing was impossible. She made our stay great from the moment we contacted her.The rooms at The James have a modern style yet maintain a sense of luxury. Everything was clean--not a speck of dust anywhere. A carafe of water is replenished daily, and the mini bar is well stocked, if a bit pricey. We didn't need or want anything in it anyway. Our bed was super comfortable, after a long day walking it felt great to lay down! We had a quiet room on the 10th floor and never heard any other guests.We did utilize the on site spa for a massage, and although it is a very small space, the service was great and it was very peaceful. Overall, there is nothing I can criticize about The James. We loved our stay and will definitely stay there again!",nan,nan,ta_s218
trip_advisor,"Having stayed at the James before, we continue to enjoy the great central location of one block off Michigan in the heart of the miracle mile.Finding the room cramped on previous visits, we obtained a larger room. It was still cramped. With more age personally, we found the chic sofa and wire chairs very uncomfortable. But who, while visiting Chicago sits long in a hotel room. We did like the larger sleeping area.The Hotel has more of a younger clientele, but we did not feel out of place at all. The services of the hotel were used often and were always great.",nan,nan,ta_s219
trip_advisor,"I am a repeat guest of The James. I enjoyed my stay enough to book a series of corporate events there the following year. It is a very modern, urban-chic hotel with a hot little bar in the lobby. The Primehouse Restaurant served us well for random lunches as well as for the catered event for my company. The service is wonderful and the front desk staff is courteous and flexible. The location is fabulous- a short walk to Michigan Ave. Highly recommend for adult leisure and corporate events.",nan,nan,ta_s220
trip_advisor,"Stayed at The James for 3 nights and found the room to be very comfortable (double deluxe). Very clean, good lighting near beds and seating (but not at entrance to room near closet where I kept my open suitcase and wished there was an overhead light to see what I was rifling through). Very comfortable mattresses and pillows, large bathroom with everything I needed. Although on the 14th floor, there was noise from the city street. I slept through it for the most part but my husband had to pop in ear plugs the last few nights. To be expected, the 14th is still not that high when you are right in the city. We used several of the hotel's amenities - the gym, which was a nice size and very well equipped, the free car service when we went to dinner one night a distance away before going to a show at Second City (hysterical, recommend seeing one), and room service when we were too tired to go back out for dinner one night (the food was excellent although I only had soup, salad, and a fruit salad - every last bit of fruit in the salad was perfectly ripe). We also had breakfast in the dining room one morning, enjoyed our meals much more there then the two popular breakfast places we had to line up and wait to get in. The food was really fresh and the coffee is fantastic, it is the same coffee they have at the front desk in the morning. A big kudos to the staff, every last person we spoke with was friendly and helpful. If you are a walker, the location of the hotel is great. We walked to Navy Pier, the Hancock Tower and the beach nearby, Millennium and Grant Park, and the train station (red line) that we took to Wrigley Field; the station is about 3 blocks away from the hotel. If the line for a train pass is too long, there is a Jewel Osco right around the corner that sells train tix at their Service Desk. Great restaurants right around the area (we loved The Purple Pig). Trader Joe's was great for quick snacks to fuel up, right across the street. I would definitely stay at The James again, no complaints!",nan,nan,ta_s221
trip_advisor,This is the first hotel I have been to in years that has no movies. And it uses satellite TV with poor reception. It was a rainy chicago afternoon so I figured I would settle into a movie. Nothing. Doesn't exist. Other than that there is very little storage for clothes. They do have the best in room bar I have ever seen with premium liquors. Ron was kind of small but adequate. King bed was very comfortable. Room.was very clean and personnel courteous.,nan,nan,ta_s222
trip_advisor,"The hotel simply had fewer amenities than I had hoped. To be fair, the bed was very comfortable, and the staff was excellent and attentive, but the simple fact that the rooms were older and slightly shabbier than the rooms of peer hotels, and included fewer built in luxuries, was enough to make me feel less pampered than I would have liked. In fairness, the room was very hip and very clean, and the bed was extremely comfortable. In a typical hotel that I was expecting to simply crash in, with no expectations of luxury, I would have been more than satisfied. Its just that the billing of the hotel put me in mind of a more luxurious setting.",nan,nan,ta_s223
trip_advisor,"I've stayed here twice and had a great time on both occasions. The rooms are clean and comfortable. My wife appreciated the high quality bath products. The staff is excellent. They are all very friendly, helpful and professional.The hotel is in a great location for playing around the city. They offer bikes to use for free, which we took advantage of and rode over to the beautiful lake shore path.",nan,nan,ta_s224
trip_advisor,"The James hotel is very centrally located for seeing Chicago attractions and restaurants. Being close to Eataly and a Whole Foods was very convenient as we were travelling with two picky eaters. The hotel staff were fabulous and the rooms were pleasant and spotless. The hotel gave our children very thoughtful loot bags with a beautiful colouring book, wooden aeroplane, crayons, and a cookbook. This is a charming hotel.",nan,nan,ta_s225

Online booking with 20% discountLocation: less than a minute to the Magnificent Mile and major boutiques.

Amenities as expected. Well-stocked mini-barStaff: all very helpful and friendly, requests were seen to promptly or more quickly than expected; the concierge staff are almost like local travel agents, looking up, booking and printing tickets on my behalfDining: Burke's Primehouse provides the on-site and in-room dining menus, reputed to be the best steakhouse in Chicago.

trip_advisor,"Great value, great design, great location. Linens are crisp and clean, beds are super comfortable. Can't beat it for it's location regardless of why you are visiting Chi town. Service was great from doorman to concierge. Rooms aren't huge but still feel comfortable. Repeat - great value for a boutique hotel.",nan,nan,ta_s228
trip_advisor,"This is now my third stay (and third review) of the James. First the good: as usual, spectacular customer service, right in the heart of shopping and dining (Trader Joe's and Starbucks right across the street!), and a very clean, contemporary and sophisticated boutique property. There have been a few renovations since I stayed here last and the room refresh looks great. This is the first time I've used the concierge, wonderfully knowledgeable and was able to get us a shorter wait in line at the Grand Lux Cafe in the next block. Now, the not-so-good: we stayed in a Studio Loft Suite on the 17th floor. The heating/cooling system is situated in the room such that the cold air blows directly on you when you are in bed. Brrrrrr!!! In order to keep from freezing, we had to put the unit on ""auto"" which meant that the room kept alternating from muggy to cold and every time the unit kicked on, it would wake us up and it runs loud. Did not make for good sleeping--which is too bad because the bed is very comfortable. Also, in addition to the two televisions, there is also a projection television. It seemed to be malfunctioning because when we tried to turn it off via remote control it kept going into ""stand-by"" mode and turning itself back on after about 3 minutes. I eventually had to climb up and turn off by using the power button on the projection unit itself. And finally, the ""it-would-have-been-nice"": although I received the extra ""perk"" of ""turn-down service"" along with chocolates (!) the previous two times I've stayed here. . .we didn't experience that on this stay. I don't know if it's been discontinued. . .and the lack of it certainly didn't ruin our stay, but I wanted to mention it because other reviewers had. I also thought we might have received a little ""perk"" when we mentioned it was our wedding anniversary (on a previous stay, I received cupcakes for my birthday), but we did not. It was those ""little"" touches on my previous stays that seemed to be missing this time.Overall, our stay was nice (except for the sleeping), but my previous two stays were a bit better. I do intend to stay here again!",nan,nan,ta_s229
trip_advisor,"Just returned from a night at The James in Chicago. We'll never stay anywhere else. Perfect location. From the moment we stepped out of our car, the staff graciously took care of us. Front desk quickly called the restaurant and we had our table for two. Spacious room, nice bathroom with lots of amenities, complimentary WiFi, spotlessly clean, comfy bed with lots of pillows. It was such a wonderful experience!",nan,nan,ta_s230
trip_advisor,"First time in Chicago & definitely got the hotel right. The James has a great location just off Michigan Avenue in the heart of the Magnificent Mile - walking distance to lots of shopping, great restaurants & many attractions. Staff was terrific & helpful. If they sensed we had a question or were wondering about something, they would politely ask or offer to help out. The room (king suite) was very contemporary and very clean. Highly recommend it!",nan,nan,ta_s231
trip_advisor,"Upon arrival I was a bit nervous of the hotel staff being snobby, given the location, but no they were so receiving and answered all my questions with a smile. I valeted at 60 dollars for 24 hour in and out privileges which isn't bad since it is mega expensive to park downtown. Walking into the room was like walking into the mad men set, well the hotel in general. It's like a little home away from home. The bed was insanely comfortable just sinks in when you lay down. They include a little bar area and sink for all of your mixing needs. The room was better than any hotel I have ever stayed. Way to go James!",nan,nan,ta_s232
trip_advisor,"I stayed at the James Hotel in Chicago over Memorial Day in 2014 and the hotel and service were beyond amazing.Firstly the hotel is in great shape and they even upgraded us to a loft room which was very large and great amenities including a wall projector! The gym was great and had all the equipment you would need.Secondly and more importantly the staff was super helpful. They catered to every request and the concierge service helped me plan an amazing weekend in the Windy City. Special kudos goes out to Laurelin Hefter, who took great care in ensuring our weekend went off without any problems. She even checked in on her day off.I would recommend the James to anyone looking to visit the city and call ahead and discuss your travel plans with the concierge as they gave great advice on where to eat and drink.",nan,nan,ta_s233
trip_advisor,"The hotel had problems with needing repairs on 2 rooms and were over booked. They called us 1 day before we arrived and offered to put us at the Palomar for 1 night free, gave us a 75$ credit. and paid our cab fair to and from the Palomar. We had a wonderful stay at both hotels but much prefered The James Hotel. They have wonderful comfortable beds and pillows, and wonderful and friendly staff. The adjoining steak house has excellent food and service. Traders Joes and a bakery are across the street.",nan,nan,ta_s234
trip_advisor,"This was my second stay at The James, and I loved every moment. This hotel is a gem among luxury boutiques in the Magnificent mile area. However, the employees are the true stars. Well, there may be just one that is a bad apple but whatever... The service is top notch and a great value. I always feel like royalty when I stay. The staff at David Burke's in Chicago is even more friendly than those at the New York location. There are no words for the food, except WOW, and YUM! I highly recommend that you try a hotel suite instead of just a room. Also, dine in the restaurant instead of ordering room service. I am still smiling...",nan,nan,ta_s235
trip_advisor,"Great staff, great service, and perfect location! The hotel was very modern looking, neat, and clean with speedy elevators. The room itself was just as neat and clean and bright. The room is, as others have said, minimalist in nature. I don't mean that as a bad thing either. You have everything you need but not a lot more. The bed was very comfortable and the linens were fabulous! The bathroom was very nice and the bath towels were awesome! They were huge - almost 6 ft long! No wimpy towels here. The location of the hotel was perfect for everything that we had planned. Couldn't have picked a better location to stay. The only thing that I would say as a Con would be the exorbitant parking fee! Use SpotHero and you can park across the street for about1/3 the cost of parking at the hotel. Would definitely stay here again.",nan,nan,ta_s236
trip_advisor,"We thoroughly enjoyed our few nights at The James. The location really can't be beat and is close to shopping, restaurants, the ""L"" but not so close that it is noisy. The room was exceedingly comfortable and quiet. Very well equipped bar in the room. Everyone was very friendly. Also really enjoyed having a 2pm checkout. Everything was perfect for us and will stay again next time we are in Chicago.",nan,nan,ta_s238
trip_advisor,"We were upgraded- great. The room was kind of different, fairly modern and nice. My guess is that the upgrade was for an extra sofa couch bed?? on the other side of the room, which would have been fine had there been three of us, but that was not the case. They had three TV's in the room and they were being upgraded to HD as we were checking out, which would help as the image on the one in our room was marginal at best. The bathrooms were updated and very nice.A nice hotel for non-business occasions, strategically located 1/2 block off Michigan Ave. The minibar was wells stocked and reasonably priced.Air conditioner was noisy, and this was the only negative we experienced. Would definitely recommend.",nan,nan,ta_s239
trip_advisor,"I've stayed at the James twice in the last year, really hoping to like this hotel. But each time, I've been disappointed by the rooms and service. It's not that the James is a poor choice in Chicago, it's just that I've had so many better experiences in the city at hotels that often cost half as much.On a recent stay, I ""upgraded"" to a Queen suite. When I arrived in the suite, I found a single room the size of an average hotel room. In fact, the suite was smaller than the regular room at the James I stayed in on a previous visit. Yes, there were two televisions (the one in the sleeping ""nook"" did not work). The room didn't even have a desk, which I needed to get some work done. The mini fridge was warm when I went to grab a soda. And though the decor is cool, the furniture and carpet is a bit tatty and worn.The location of this hotel is excellent. It is in the heart of the city. No complaints there at all. The service is generally good as well, though when I checked out and explained my disappointment with the size of the ""suite,"" the broken television and warm fridge, the desk clerk patronizingly explained that it is a boutique hotel and I shouldn't expect a large room. Thanks a lot.The bottom line is this: There are many fine hotels in Chicago. Competition is fierce for your hotel dollar in this city. It's not enough to be ""pretty good"" -- which is where the James falls, in my opinion. I've tried it twice and won't return. I get much better service and much better accommodations at other hotels in Chicago. And if you book here, don't bother with a suite. It certainly isn't worth the extra money.",nan,nan,ta_s240
trip_advisor,I like this hotel-hip and the furnishings are fun and very comfortable. The robe and slippers are a nice touch. My TV in the bed area did not work-I called the desk and the next day they had it fixed-nice customer service. The location is great also. The only downside is the noise in the rooms. They have these vents for the temperature control that are unbelievably loud-it was almost deafening. I had the option of being hot all night or having this thunderous roar of the vent right by my bed. Not restful. It might just be the room I was in-stay away from 1021 suite. Great suit set up but you won't have a restful sleep. Nice staff!,nan,nan,ta_s241
trip_advisor,"The staff rocks. from the bellmen to the maintenance engineers to the GM, everyone was very welcoming and genuine. The one bedroom suites are gorgeous. Ours had a north and west view. it was super modern, AWESOME bed and VERY clean. A special thanks to Meg who made our every need come true. We booked several rooms and not a single issue with anyone. David Burke's is attached to the hotel. If you have the time, DO IT.",nan,nan,ta_s242
trip_advisor,"Last week, my wife and I spend four nights at The James and we had a great time. The hotel is located in a very good spot, very close to the ""Magnificent Mile"" and not far from the loop. The room was very clean and neat. What I liked the most was the service. The whole staff was very helpful, effective and trully friedly. Lucas (doorman) an Laurelin (concirge) are good examples of that. The hotel also offers four good bikes that can be used by guests 4hours a day free of charge, what I found out to be a good option to explore the areas close to the lake (from Lincoln Park to tre Planetarium).",nan,nan,ta_s243
trip_advisor,"My wife and I stayed here this weekend in celebration of our one year anniversary. They took such wonderful care of us and made our experience just as good as our wedding day. They make you feel like family which is the best way you can treat someone. Unless you don't like your family or they don't like you, in which case they treat you better than family. In all seriousness this Hotel and it's staff are wonderful and kind and considerate. The concierge even took the time to go out and buy flowers and arrange them (beautifully I might add) to have them in our room. That's service and that's what you'll get at the James.",nan,nan,ta_s244
trip_advisor,"My husband and I drove from Toronto to Chicago for the Easter long weekend. After a long drive arriving at the hotel was such a relief. We loved our clean, spacious room. If we come back to Chicago we are definitely staying here. You don't feel cheated spending your money staying at this hotel. Parking downtown Chicago is extremely expensive so, we looked online and found Spothero as our solution. Definitely use spothero it'll save you a lot of $$s.",nan,nan,ta_s245
trip_advisor,"I can't say enough about this hotel. To begin with it was wonderful. The room was huge (a suite) with a comfortable bed dressed with crisp white linens and plenty of pillows. The bathroom was gigantic and super clean. The whole place was super clean. Two flat screen TVs was great as well. There is a terrific lobby bar called Jimmy's that was crowded and happening at all times of day and night. The bartenders were professional and friendly and knew how to make a drink. Very important!!! We always book a hotel with a lobby bar and this lobby bar was one of the best. The hotel is located on Rush and Ontario which is right in the middle of everything. It was easy to get around Chicago because of the location, public transportation and feet that like to walk. We will definitely stay here again. And the price was VERY reasonable. Less than $300 a night for a larger corner room with plenty of windows on an upper floor with great views.",nan,nan,ta_s246
trip_advisor,"From the moment we arrived at the hotel we were made to feel welcome. Check in was efficient and friendly and within 30 mins of arriving a bottle of wine and chocolates arrived for our anniversary.The location is excellent, two minutes from the Magnificent Mile and an easy walking distance to Navy Pier and theatres.The concierge desk was most helpful with directions and and some great restaurant recommendations.The doormen were also extremely courteous and friendly.Breakfast was also taken at the hotel with plenty of choice from granola through to full breakfast. Again friendly helpful staff.Rooms are comfy lovely lights on dimmer switches , huge comfy beds and a well equiped bathroom with plenty of towels.Rooms also have huge tv, safe, hairdryer and iron.Free use of wifi and hotel computers to print boarding passes.Pre check in requests can be made via the hotel website on arrival day. We asked for high floor quiet room and got a room on top floor away from the elevator.All in all a great place to stay in the city - highly recommended.",nan,nan,ta_s247
trip_advisor,"Stayed for three nights and enjoyed the excellent amenities, including use of the ""house car"", turndown service, and bottle of water delivered daily. The rooms were average size and the bed was very comfortable. All of the staff we encountered were very friendly and helpful. The location is great for accessing Michigan Avenue and was an easy walk to the El. The only down side was the noise from the street, even on the 10th floor. Blaring horns and sirens all night. But, I think that is more about the city itself than the hotel. Perhaps the folk who are in charge should consider an passing an ordinance similar to NYC, where cab drivers are fined for using their horn.Bring you earplugs and enjoy your stay. I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone staying in Chicago.",nan,nan,ta_s248
trip_advisor,"My wife and I were given a stay at the James as a gift from my sister and Brother In-Law around the holidays to celebrate our wedding. They picked the perfect location. The staff was extremely friendly and helpful and always greeted us with a smile. When we asked directions to various locations (since this was both of our first times in Chicago), the made sure they gave us step-by-step directions so we would not get lost. Our room upgrade to a King Studio was amazing! The room was the perfect size and was extremely clean and well kept. I had worked with Laurelin, one of the nicest people from concierge, and she assisted me in planning a rose petal turn down service in the best way possible. Whenever I called the front desk or concierge, I was greeted by name and I could tell that the person on the end of the line was smiling. We had Spa treatments at the hotel as well and they left my wife and I in a state of complete and utter relaxation. This was a fantastic hotel and I look for to staying there again in the future!",nan,nan,ta_s249
trip_advisor,"We lucked into this hotel via Hotwire for 5 days in April. The rooms are decent size and fairly modern looking. The lobby, restaurant and bar are warm and welcoming. The staff was friendly -- Lucas in particular seems like he works 18 hour days for as often as helped us. We would definitely stay there again at the Hotwire price but probably not at the published rate.Only complaints would be the beds were not very comfortable as we both felt the mattresses were too soft. Also, there are no ice machines, you have to call for ice. The hotel guide indicated there was a nightly turndown service that provided ice but we never had that so we often had to call for it. I didn't bother calling about the refrigerators but there were two in the room and neither was working. One was stocked with drinks for the cash bar and the other was empty. Again, we didn't plan on using them so it wasn't an issue for us. I'm sure if we would have called it wouldn't have been dealt with.The location is perfect, just a block away from Michigan ave, and a few blocks north of the river. Plenty of things to do nearby, plus buses and a train station a short walk away.The rooms have a radio with an ipod connection and can play some ""white noise"" like rain, wind, ocean, etc.",nan,nan,ta_s250
trip_advisor,I have stayed at 12 different hotels in the Chicago Michigan ave. area and I will tell you this blew away every one of them. From the doorman when I arrived and to the doorman on my exit everyone deserved a pay raise. the hotel itself is amazing so much to look at and yet simple. The art work was amazing the bed was superb and the modern design of the room was perfect. I stayed in my room longer than probably any hotel I have ever stayed in as it was so relaxing. Check inn and check out are at 2;00 pm so I did not need to rush out in the morning :).When making your reservation or if dun threw another party call the hotel and ask for an inside facing room so as to have silence no car noise no sirens that you will find in most hotels in a city. Over all the best ever experience at a hotel out side of Las Vegas.,nan,nan,ta_s251
trip_advisor,"Hotel rooms should feel inviting as you walk in. But our room was white. Everything was white. It was a small box room. The bathroom door had to be pushed to the side to open. The shower curtain was terry cloth. The pictures were small. The clothes closet was a pressed board thing pushed in the corner. I could go on, but we were VERY sadly disappointed. It seemed like they were trying to be one of the big guys, but just didn't know how to get it together. AND the valet parking was $60. Perhaps this is normal for Chicago but we were shocked, particularly when they could have offered to tell us that a public parking lot was right around the corner. Just so disappointed.",nan,nan,ta_s252
trip_advisor,"I booked a 3-night stay over Easter weekend through Hotwire at a hotel that turned out to be the James. I arrived early on Saturday to be warmly welcomed by the doorman and the front-desk staff. I was happy to find out that a room was ready for early check-in, but somewhat less thrilled to find that it was a room with two double beds instead of one king bed, and that it was on the third floor. The very nice girl who checked me in assured me that if I didn't like the room, I could always request a change. She also did a great job in telling me about all the hotel amenities.My third floor room, as feared, did indeed have a pretty awful view of some HVAC equipment and an alley full of dumpsters. However, the positive thing about facing the alley was the lack of street noise. Had I gotten a third-floor room facing the street, it would have been less peaceful. I kept my blinds drawn most of the time to block the inauspicious view, but otherwise, the room itself was perfectly fine. I was afraid the minimalist decor would feel too stark and sterile, but it managed to exude a sense of Zen-like tranquility instead. Everything worked well; I esp. liked the lighting with its dimmer switches and the amenities like coffee/tea-making supplies. The beds were super-comfortable and I slept really well all three nights.The bathroom was also well-appointed and clean, though one thing that bothered me was that spare towels were stacked on a low shelf right next to the toilet. That seemed awfully unhygienic. Also, the medicinal smell of the Intelligent Nutrients toiletries took some getting used to at first.While my room was clean overall, the standards of the housekeeping staff didn't quite match the service I found elsewhere in the hotel. First, my room never actually received any evening turndown service, though the hotel touts daily turndown service among its amenities. (I wondered whether lower-floor rooms are less valued and therefore receive more lackadaisical service, because there were other minor issues: my room was missing a safe; there were no slippers to go with the bathrobes; and the body lotion in the bathroom was never replenished when it ran low. To be fair, the only one of these issues I reported was the missing safe, and the staff not only rectified the situation promptly, but they were also as nice and apologetic as could be.Despite the minor issues I encountered, my last impression of the hotel was one of graciousness and efficiency. Upon checking out, when I told the doorman that I needed a cab to the Clark/Lake station, he responded that the complimentary car service was available to take me there, and in no time at all, my luggage and I were whisked into the gleaming SUV.I didn't use the hotel's business center, gym, spa, concierge or dining options, so can't comment on those services. Leafing through the dining menus, I did feel that the dining options were all really meat-centric, and therefore not appealing to me. My favorite breakfast destination in the neighborhood was the lovely, casual Pierrot Gourmet in the Peninsula Hotel.For the low Hotwire rate I paid ($95/night), the James certainly provided excellent value. I do feel, though, that the minor housekeeping issues I encountered keep the James a notch or two below a hotel like the nearby Palomar (whose room decor and Kimpton perks I also prefer), but I'd definitely consider staying at the James again.",nan,nan,ta_s253
trip_advisor,"Our stay started badly as the 'deluxe' room we were given was, as the wonderfully helpful Lobby Assistant agreed, in an 'unacceptable' state. The blind in the bathroom was held up by black sticky tape, the cover on the filthy heater was missing as was the cover on the light switch, whose plate was covered in greasy finger marks. There was no proper shower - just one in the bath. The bathroom had a sliding door and the wardrobe was behind a sad curtain. Chips out of the furniture. However, thanks to the Lobby Assistant, the hotel tried very hard to resolve the problem. He showed us every other room they had available and they were certainly in a far better condition. We were given a reduced rate to upgrade to a Loft Room and a credit towards food. The Loft Rooms (which, strangely, are not in the loft but on the tenth floor) are a better bet as they are bigger and have a proper table and chairs for eating/working at. They also have a double bed and a 'media' bed. The latter is for lying on to watch films on a big screen. Alas, projector was missing and we did not see a DVD player. Perhaps you have to ask for these. We weren't fussed and I am sure they would have been provided had we asked for them.I was staying with my son so we asked for the media bed to be made up for him. Indeed it was but with a horrible polyester blanket that gave him electric shocks! This was changed immediately, at my request, the next day. Incidentally, their bedlinen is beautiful, fine Egyptian cotton.The bathroom had the same strange sliding door as the deluxe room but at least it had a proper (and very good) shower. That said, they should provide some instructions on how to use it! My son is an engineer and it took him some time to work it out. I hated the toiletries, as did he. They were supposed to be some organic stuff and were plentiful in the shower but they stung! The hotel is a conversion from some old apartment block and it is not an entire success. The rooms are small and dark. They aim to be uber-cool but are not and are all beginning to look rather tired.However, the staff is very helpful, the position could not be more perfect - just off the 'Magnificent Mile/Michigan Avenue' and the David Burke Primehouse is a fantastic restaurant. Mainly steak, obviously, but a wonderfully wide range of food. Great waiting staff; the wine waiter took infinite care over my two glasses of wine! Food fantastic. The restaurant was full so you need to book in advance.",nan,nan,ta_s254
trip_advisor,"The James hotel is a great place to stay while in Chicago. First, the staff at the hotel were friendly and great. The rooms were clean and the bed very comfortable. The hotel is very well located to many of the tourist sites. There are lots of restaurants and shopping near the hotel. Laurelin Hefter at the Concierge was most help in arranging tours for us. Other concierge staff also provided us tips and guidance to many of our questions. Thanks to The James for a wonderful weekend.",nan,nan,ta_s255
trip_advisor,"We stayed here for a mother daughter getaway with some school friends. I chose this hotel as it had a great location, and offered great value for money. We took the train in, which was a short cab ride from the station. The doorman greeted us with a warm welcome. We did get both rooms on the same floor, which was a bonus. Beds were very comfortable and the extra amenities such as a mini bar, snacks, shampoo, bathroom and writing desk was a bonus. Concierge desk was helpful (Laura Lynn?). The best of all is that they had a car service ,if available, will take you to where you want to go downtown. We used it twice an Audi Q7, NICE. EJ was such a gentleman and good driver :) I would stay again as well as recommend it to my clients.",nan,nan,ta_s256
trip_advisor,"I'm so glad we booked this hotel for our weekend! Upon arrival I was immediately pleased with our choice. Alex at the desk checked us in and we were upgraded to a studio room, (I booked through expedia). He was very friendly and knowledgable about the hotel. In fact every member of the staff we encountered was not only helpful but also genuinely friendly. Anyone can be polite, but everyone we interacted with seemed like they really did enjoy their job and were more than happy to help.Our room was lovely, intelligently designed and a great use of space throughout. The bed was really very comfortable and though we didn't take advantage of this perk, there was a note in the room that offered a few different types of pillows that you could try. I slept so well, and that is rare for me when I'm traveling. The bathroom is a good size and I personally really appreciated the lit magnified mirror. The tub was not so comfortable for soaking but that's ok. The shower head provided a nice soak and the water pressure was pretty good. I really liked that this hotel uses full size communal shampoo, conditioner and body wash; so much less waste and if you are staying for multiple days it means you don't have to bring those items with you. I didn't get a chance to use the hotel's spa, but in the brochure they offered a wide range of services. If our trip had been longer I would have loved a massage.I really liked the gym as well, they had a variety of equipment and everything was clean and well organized. I had a good workout and it was a good way to start the day.As we were leaving, one of the guys at the door was nice enough to give us a ride to the train station in the hotel's car service. I wish I could remember his name because he was super nice and friendly, plus he saved us a cab ride. I kind of forgot that the hotel offered this service; we will definitely take advantage of it more next time. Which brings me to my next point: We will absolutely stay here again, repeatedly, and so should you.",nan,nan,ta_s257
trip_advisor,"Every time I've stayed at The James, I've been blown away. The location is perfect/close to everything and the rooms are lovely, with amazing bath products. But what REALLY keeps me coming back are the people that work there. I've never had a bad encounter with ANYONE. Especially the gentlemen at the door....SO professional and courteous. They greet me and make me feel like a queen every single time, whether I'm dressed up or look like I've just rolled off a truck somewhere. It's the nicest feeling in the world. The front desk is just as wonderful...everyone stops to greet me when I walk past and anything I need is always immediately taken care of. I have no idea how they do it with such remarkable consistency!! I won't stay anywhere else in Chicago.",nan,nan,ta_s258
trip_advisor,"I stayed here at the beginning and end of a 4,000 mile road trip around the Midwest and Northwest in May 2014.It's a lovely hotel, well located within walking distance of Millennium Park and the awesome AIC. Staff were pleasant and helpful, the rooms were clean and well appointed. On the second visit I booked a riverfront room, which had a great window-snug overlooking the river. Definitely worth the additional cost. I'd be tempted to use the same hotel when I return to Chicago, which isn't something I usually do.",nan,nan,ta_s259
trip_advisor,"Each member of the staff I encountered provided exceptional hospitality, from the welcome I received at the front desk, the attentive restaurant service, the enthusiastic doorman, the pleasant wine hostess, zipping out at checkout even with some incidentals, and even a follow up from the manager. Great location, comfortable room, but it was the service that set this trip apart.",nan,nan,ta_s260
trip_advisor,"We just left the Monaco hotel and were a bit unimpressed with our visit. All the staff that we encountered were extremely friendly and very helpful, especially the hotel Porters.Although our room was clean, it was nothing to write home about. Upon entering the room and inspecting the mini-fridge, there was a can of sprite missing already. Next, the toilet in the bathroom was not very secured to the floor and therefore it wobbled. We looked outside, not expecting a fantastic view, and were greeted with a rooftop featuring a dead pigeon that had been there for a while. Before we could fully unpack our belongings, a man who (we assume?) worked there knocked on our door and asked if he could come in and take a picture of the office chair. As he pulled out his smart phone and took a picture of the chair, he stated that they were in the process of updating some of the furniture in rooms. He then also peaked at the soap dish in the bathroom before leaving. This made us extremely uncomfortable. The next morning, at 8:45am, we were woke up to someone knocking on the door saying ""housekeeping"". I opened the door and the lady apologized and stated that she could come back later. At 10:30am, someone else came to the door and knocked from housekeeping. I opened the door again, slightly frustrated and a different lady apologized and stated that she could come back later. I told her to come back at noon when we had checked out. Upon leaving, one of the Porters held our bags so that we could enjoy the city without being weighed down. When we came back, the other Porter remembered us, asked how our night in the city was, opened the door for us, grabbed our bags and then asked if he could call a cab for us. Exceptional service.Overall, our stay was okay. I was glad that our room was clean and the staff was friendly, but all other aspects of our visit were sub par.",nan,nan,ta_s261
trip_advisor,"I am a Kimpton fan. They find a grand (and often older) property and turn an interior design firm loose to enhance the original architecture and designs with new energy and flare. In the Monaco group this means that the feel is traditional, elegant but bright and fun. At Hotel Monaco Chicago, the location just off of North Michigan and in view of the river makes it an ideal location for walking and exploring; the park, the museum, food and of course the blues. For this visit, I used Karma points earned over the last year and was treated on arrival to an upgrade to a beautiful suite. The staff, as usual was ready at every contact to see what I might need. The restaurant was great at breakfast and for afternoon coffee.So, the Kimptons always make traveling a pleasure and this Chicago location gets it all right.",nan,nan,ta_s262
trip_advisor,"Very nice location for Michigan Ave, Loop, or River North destinations. Walkable to Millenium Park and Art Institute- when its not too cold!. Nice rooms- we went for the goldfish companion for fun. Restaurant is fair but solid for bar drinks (very good bartender) and breakfast. Had to stay an extra night due to an ice storm in home city and was accommodated seamlessly. Wine and hot cider (spiked and non) happy hour. As with all Kimptons- a boutique fun feel that benefits from the chain's good taste and standards is without unwanted surprises. Next to the Virgin Hotel and seems a much hipper and lively property.Fine for couples, families and small pets.",nan,nan,ta_s263
trip_advisor,"Love this hotel. Third time to stay there and I always enjoy it. I was in Chicago for a conference, but instead of staying at the conference hotel, I walked daily in the snow and cold weather to stay at the Monaco. That is how much I enjoy the hotel. Great people - friendly service - excellent location. I will definintely be back.",nan,nan,ta_s264
trip_advisor,Try to get a room above the 9th floor because its on a busy street also ask for a river view. Our room was so sweet it had two window seats the one was 6ft x 4ft the other was smaller but both with cushions and pillows. Friendly Staff and they worked with us on everything. Warning not every floor has a ice machine so when you leave your room take your ice bag so you can stop and get ice on your return and not have to go to the room to get your bag then to another floor.,nan,nan,ta_s265
trip_advisor,"Just returned home from the BigTen tournament in Chicago. A friend had booked his room here,so I did as well.Very classy,boutique feel hotel. Smaller, but just right. Staff were very friendly. Room was awesome! Only suggestion would be to have a few bottles of water in the room,as there is no ice or beverages. The parking is a shock at $58 a day,but I understand that's the norm. Would definitely come back. Great location also. Will look for Kimpton hotels in the future.",nan,nan,ta_s266
trip_advisor,"We stayed in a Riverview Mediterranean suite, not much expense to upgrade, but definitely worth the money. We had corner room with amazing views of the river on both walls. Better yet, we had so much room to spread out and sleep.There are extremely comfortable window seats that are the size of twin mattresses in the main bedroom and half the width in the sitting room. Easily, you could sleep 10-12 people. That brings me to the only downside... the bathroom. It felt very dated, with chips of fiberglass tub exposed. (Granted, it was the world's deepest tub-- almost like a swimming pool). However, the space would be better served with a more generous shower. This one was big enough for me, but feels like an RV shower size. Some cracks in the grout, but nothing that would stop me from booking again.Back to the positives... the service was exceptional, the room phenomenally clean, and noise was not excessive (street noise can be heard, but it's not worse than any other big city hotel). The staff even made up beds with a quick phone call. While you may expect housekeeping to do this automatically, you definitely don't expect them to set up beds in the window seats and have your kiddo's favorite stuffed animal waiting for them. VERY great job.The location was easily walkable to many main areas. A black Uber car service was $15 to John Hancock building/Water Tower theater.",nan,nan,ta_s267
trip_advisor,"I have to start by saying I am a huge Kimpton (and Hotel Monaco) fan. I try to stay at Kimpton's as much as possible when traveling and appreciate their unique, boutique style and great customer service.The Hotel Monaco in Chicago is very centrally located. I was there for an entire week on business, traveling solo and found it to be easy for me to walk to most places or quickly get a cab when necessary. The decor was very true to Monaco style - although maybe not quite as eclectic as other versions in Seattle or Portland. My room had a nice view and adorable window seat and was a nice size. I think my only complaint was that room service was...basically only edible at best. I got room service dinner I believe my first night there as I had arrived pretty late and it was really not good. Otherwise - great place to stay when traveling to Chicago! Also great rates!",nan,nan,ta_s268
trip_advisor,"I can't say enough about how much I love both the hotel itself and the staff at Hotel Monaco Chicago. The actual physical hotel is beautiful and the window seats in the rooms are a hit with the kids and the adults. I have had interaction with the manager, the desk staff and the concierge and I just can't express how pleasant and helpful they are. The doorman and the concierge really make my daughter feel special when we stay here, they are so sweet and really engage her in conversation. We visited the Monaco before school started after a difficult summer that included accident and injuries, I let the hotel know this was a special trip for us and they were so nice. Sent up a welcome basket and a card, love the people that work in this hotel!! We will be spending Easter with you this year.",nan,nan,ta_s269
trip_advisor,"We stayed for a girls weekend. We contacted the concierge, Sheila Garg, before our trip and she was unbelievably helpful. She welcomed us upon arrival, added even more restaurant and site seeing options, and even sent a little treat up to our room. The front desk was very attentive and friendly. The evening happy hour is a nice little touch.This hotel is in a great location, steps from a Starbucks and an Irish Pub across the street.We were able to walk to great shopping and the Chicago Institute of Arts. Great stay!",nan,nan,ta_s270
trip_advisor,"I have stayed at this lovely hotel many times and always found it to be a pleasure. The rooms are beautiful and well appointed. The meeting rooms and gym are great. But the customer service keeps me coming back. All the staff are friendly, personable and professional. And then there are the charming quirky touches like the goldfish! If you are looking for a place to stay with great access to Michigan Ave shopping, museums and Millenium Park this is a perfect location and you are a block and a half from the CTA Orange Line to travel other places in the city.",nan,nan,ta_s271
trip_advisor,"The hotel is older and charming. The attached restaurant is great for Brunch, Lunch and Dinner. The Bar is lively.I liked this hotel for many reasons. It is a great bargain given the location and style of the hotel. Our room was plenty large and the bathroom were spacious as well. Many wonderful things to do in this great city.",nan,nan,ta_s272
trip_advisor,"We picked this hotel because it was a few minutes walk to the Chicago Theater for the Louis CK show and had some really nice restaurants nearby. The people at check-in were extra friendly and our room was larger than we expected. We had 6 PM dinner reservations so the early evening complimentary wine bar was a pleasant surprise and we enjoyed sipping wine in front of the lobby fireplace for 30 minutes before heading out into the frigid January Chicago weather for dinner. Besides the excellent coffee in the lobby be sure to try the cucumber flavored water. The hotel Wi-Fi was around $12.00 but it looked like if you joined their ""club"" with your email address it was free. We were not there long enough to bother with it.",nan,nan,ta_s273
trip_advisor,Let me start by saying how picky I can be about hotels. This hotel is spectacular!! Location location location!! It is right in the heart of downtown close to everything including michigan ave for shopping! Now the more important stuff. I must say I have never stayed at a hotel where everyone went above and beyond to make you fee welcome and right at home. From Erika at the front desk to I believe it was Sierra at concierge to the most amazing two doormen in the lobby Antonio and Michael. I truly can't mention enough how amazing these two are. Very helpful in helping you find anything from a restaurant to parking lots that are close and below average!! They stand out in this cold but their personalities and politeness warm you up like the cups of hot chocolate the hotel provides. I honesty am coming back to this hotel for the people that work here. An amazing hotel and on top of all that amazing service the rooms are huge. They are very clean and housekeeping deserves the credit. Can't wait to come back with my lady and that's the truth. Wish the Kimpton hotel Monaco a great and prosperous 2015!!!! FK,nan,nan,ta_s274
trip_advisor,Me and my wife spent Christmas and new years at this hotel. The hotel itself is really nice and all the staff working here are very helpful the hotel is in a great location.

If we visit Chicago again this hotel will definitely be our first choice as we could not fault this hotel for service location and friendliness.,nan,nan,ta_s275
trip_advisor,"Had a ""staycation"" at the Hotel Monaco Chicago over the holidays and it was a dream! My almost four year old niece was in from out of town for Christmas and my mother, niece, and I planned a fun ""girl's only trip"" in the city to get out of the suburbs. We checked in and the hotel staff was wonderful and very accommodating - they even had a small bag for her at check-in with golfish crackers, a toy golfish, and My Little Pony stickers. We requested a real goldfish be sent to the room and it was brought up immediately, which she loved.The window seats were great - honestly, we could have stayed in the room the whole time and she would have been excited just to hang out in the window seats! I highly suggest booking one of the suites that over looks the river - gorgeous view of the city.After dinner, and before we went out to see Cinderella on Broadway, we got back to the room and the hotel staff had left her some more fun gifts! One of the little presents was a crown and ""jewels"" that she wore to the play. We ordered room service for breakfast the next day and it was delivered at the exact time we requested - allowed us to relax a little longer in the morning before starting our day and getting everything packed up.The hotel did a wonderful job making her feel like a ""princess"" (which, as an almost four year old, is her latest obsession) and enhanced our Chicago experience. Thank you to the staff for creating great memories we were able to share with her, and making traveling with a toddler very relaxing and fun!",nan,nan,ta_s276
trip_advisor,"Stayed at the Hotel Monaco on NYE. Hotel is a typical Kimpton decor, with friendly staff, good sized rooms and comfortable beds and pillows. Front door service and valet were very attentive, and while pricey is par for the course in Chicago. A great location in the middle of the city. Would definitely stay at this hotel again. Make sure that you go to the restaurant that is connected to the hotel - South Water Kitchen - and ask for Dan to make you a drink. He, and his drinks, are amazing. We ordered some apps and had a few drinks which were great - would be interested in having dinner there during our next trip.",nan,nan,ta_s277

It was totally worth it. Sitting in the window seats looking out over the river was amazing. We loved our oversized room with the animal print robes. The wine hour in the evening, the Hot Cocoa during the day and coffee and tea in the morning were just a few a the reasons we love Kimpton Hotels. The staff is very attentive, from the doorman, to the front desk person. The concierge also helped us ahead of time to set up a few dinner reservations.",nan,nan,ta_s278
trip_advisor,"We arrived at the hotel after 2 flight changes and 2 flight delays and no baggage ! the concierge Sheila was absolutely brilliant in dealing with the airline and transport company to get our baggage ( it arrived 3 days later ), she also is a wealth of knowledge about Chicago- the best places to eat and drink ( try the ribs at Carsons ), a good place to catch a beer or two with very large food portions is the Emerald loop across the road ! make sure you ask Sheila about riding the 'L' system !",nan,nan,ta_s279
trip_advisor,"My wife and I stayed at the Hotel Monaco for four nights in September and we had a superb experience. We paid about $205.00, a corporate rate I got through my employer. The location is superb, at the top of the loop just across the river from Near North (I think there are river view rooms, but we did not have one). It is close to Millennium Park, the Art Institute, the downtown business district, and the Magnificent Mile.The rooms are large and stylish. Housekeeping is impeccable. Beds are very comfortable, and our room was quiet.Staff was very friendly and helpful. I left my car keys in the room. I rushed back, and the staff found my keys and returned them to me in time for my flight.The restaurant was tasty and stylish. Service was attentive. The prices were a little on the high side, but reasonable given the location and the fact that it is a hotel restaurant.The Monaco, like all Kimpton Hotels, offer some nice freebies: a wine hour, a $10.00 ""raid the mini-bar credit"", bottled water, coffee in the lobby in the mornings, etc. These nice touches can add up to a significant savings.If I could, I would rate this hotel 4 and 1/2 stars. Why not 5? A couple of very minor complaints. First, the gym, like that in all Kimpton hotels, is a little modest. This chain caters to an upscale crowd which values fitness; I am not sure why they have not caught up to marketplace in this regard. Second, the cold pizza offered at the wine hour was a turnoff. Either keep it hot, offer nuts or something else, or nothing at all. I did enjoy the free glass of wine each night before dinner.A final comment: the size of this hotel is idea in my opinion. It is large enough to offer plenty of services and amenities, but not so large that you feel lost in the crowd. I highly recommend this place.",nan,nan,ta_s281
trip_advisor,"I stayed at the Hotel Monaco while visiting The Loop on business. Great Kimpton property in a central downtown location between The Loop and Magnificent Mile. Great value compared to similar hotels in the area.My 14th floor room was modern and clean. It was comparable in size to the rooms I've stayed in at other downtown hotels. I especially enjoyed the window seat, which is a small bed in the window nook that provides a nice view of the city. My only complaint was that the television reception was not very good (same problem that I've encountered at other downtown hotels). Overall, I was very pleased with my stay. I will likely return to the Monaco the next time that I visit the area.",nan,nan,ta_s282
trip_advisor,"I just love this property. I head to Chicago a few times a year and this time decided to introduce a group of friends to the fantastic line of Kimpton hotels. I brough three girls with me for a weekend to see Garth Brooks at the Staples Center. We checked in and were upgraded to a larger room. Got to love Kimpton In-Touch Rewards. The room was LARGE. There were two very big window seats/beds. One of the girls made this her bed and slept there all night. It was super comfortable. These rooms are large enough for 5-6 people. We checked in and were told that we had a special treat on its way up to us later. We did some shopping and walking around and came back to the wine reception in the lobby, which is always a nice addition to these hotels. We then found the surprise in our room. There were mini bottles of vodka, lemonaide, and glow sticks for our concert with a special note that told us to have a good time at the show. You just can't find personalized service like this anywhere else. The Monaco is in a great location for everything, right near Michigan ave. A short walk to the park or to all of the shopping you could want in either direction.Overall, our stay was wonderful. Can't wait to come back!",nan,nan,ta_s283
trip_advisor,"Stayed with them one night on their local rate. The room was fine - everything was actually kind of old and run down. The problem came with my credit card. They charged me twice for the room, along with another pending charge of $267; and they also charged my girlfriend for the room. It is now five days later and we have been carrying a charge of appx. $920 on our two credit cards for almost a week for a $215 room total charge. They can wave this off to sloppy front desk work, but I find it incredibly irresponsible. I can't help but think they do this kind of thing on purpose from time to time because they get away with it. I will be avoiding Klimpton hotels and Hotel Monaco chain hotels in the future.",nan,nan,ta_s284

When we returned we found a chilled bottle of champagne, glasses, and a nice note for our anniversary.

trip_advisor,"What a surprise! As many times as I've walked along Wabash Ave., I had never noticed this hotel. I arrived late--close to midnight and found the staff, bellman and receptionist, expecting me. They immediately made me feel welcomed and as though I was a valued guest. Given the late hour, that was surprising and nice. I was immediately taken with the decor in the lobby area, enough so that I pulled out my camera to snap some pictures. The young woman behind the registration desk stepped out to point out features of interest. Afterwards, the bellman escorted me to my room and explained its features. Before he left, he asked if I needed anything else and reminded me of their names.At that point, though I felt tired, I checked out the room because it was so interesting. First things first. There were plenty of outlets, accessible from the tables and desks, and plenty of lighting. My room did not have a view, but it did have a large flat screen and a well-stocked mini bar with bottled water, named Fred, in the shape of a pint of liquor. It threw me at first, but I finally figured out it was water. But I digress. The bedside table had an alarm clock with and IPod/IPhone dock. The bathroom was fine, and thankfully had a lighted magnifying mirror. The room also has wild looking bathrobes in animal prints and a yoga mat so you can stretch out after, or before I guess, a long day. The only thing I would change is the tub. If rooms are ever upgraded, I'd probably pull the tub in my room and make the shower a walk-in. The tub was shallow and had no grab bar, so it was impractical from my perspective. However, that is a minor aside. The room was clean, the bed comfy and the hotel quiet. Now that I've discovered it, I will certainly stay there again on visits to Chicago and recommend it to you. BTW, the morning hotel staff were just as warm and friendly as the night staff had been.",nan,nan,ta_s288
trip_advisor,"Please read my full review to decide if you will be happy here nor not. First.. Location. First rate. A block from the Trump Tower, the Magnificent Mile, and the EL Loop Station. A short walk to Millenium park, the (former) Sears Tower, and the John Hancock Tower. Frankly, you cannot get a better location. We arrived at noon and our room was not yet available. We were given the option of a room on a lower floor, (with feather pillows that housekeeping would change to foam pillows) or waiting for our assigned room. We opted to wait. The ""happy"" bellman put our bags in storage. An hour later we returned and learned that our room was ready. The ""happy"" bellman retrieved our bags and asked if we wanted him to bring them to our room. We declined, but thanked him for his offer. We arrived in our room (1101) and at first glance, it was gorgeous! Every inch of it was spotless thanks to the impeccable effort of the housekeeping staff. We opened the drapes and foudn a great view of a wall. We also heard the sound of air conditioner compressors but they weren't obstrusive. When we looked out the window, we saw them on, approximately, the fourth floor. So, if your room is in the back, the higher up you are (we were on 11) the less you wil hear the A/C compressors. Now it was time to unpack for our 4 day stay. Adjacent to the bed was a large glass top night table w/o any storage. There was a large desk with numerous power outlets and a bright lamp but no drawers. The large mini bar under the 37 inch TV was well stocked but again, had no storage space. The hair dryer, surprisingly, was a discount house special which would have been fine if the outlet hadn't bee located in a place where the power cord prevented easy use with the bathroom mirror. The only storage space were the 4 small drawers in the night table. The closest had several hangers, but no storage space. This is the only reason that I had to reduce rating from 5 to 4 and, in all honesty, I was tempted to reduce it to 3. In my opinion, hotel rooms need to be useful and functional and that means enought storage space for clothes. Monoco requires you to live out of your suitcase. If you are comfortable with that, then you will love this hotel. But if you are like me, who expect a dresser and an amoire, then you will not be happy with this hotel. The staff had an ""I can do that for you"" attitude"" which I really appreciated and the housekeeping staff was outstanding.. although the hotel doesn't provide turn down service. To sum up, service is outstanding, rooms are excellent except if you need storage space for clothes etc.Location is exceptional. And, the evening complementary wine is appreciated by all. Despite excellent reviews, we were disappointed in the food at the Hotel's restaurant. Except for the excellent Egg White Omlett the rest of the food was mediocre at best. I can't figure out how they ended up with a hard boiled poached egg!",nan,nan,ta_s289
trip_advisor,"Off to a good start. I arrived early, long before check in. That was fine and I completely understood, the front desk staff had my room ready in 30 minutes which they didn't have to do - but was much appreciated. Rooms were clean and efficient. Nothing over the top, but functional. Location is 1 block south of the river - but in a great location to go anywhere downtown.The staff makes this hotel a positive experience.",nan,nan,ta_s290
trip_advisor,First off I try to stay at Kimpton Hotels in cities I visit and really like them. The Hotel Monaco was superb and no exception. Everyone was so friendly and helpful... they even surprised us with a treat bag filled with candy corn and popcorn... and a room upgrade. The room was decorated in a funky yet fun manner while at the same time very comfortable. The window seats ... more like window beds... are the best! Spent a lot of time just sitting observing the city. Room was very clean. When I travel to Chicago this is now my hotel.,nan,nan,ta_s291
trip_advisor,"I love Kimpton hotels! They have swanky decor, fun bathrobes (zebra or tiger motif) and extras such as coffee in the AM and a wine hour. This one is centrally located near Magnificent Mile and Millenium Park. We had riverview rooms which I would highly recommend as you can see the twinkling lights from the buildings reflecting on the river.",nan,nan,ta_s292
trip_advisor,"We stayed for 3 nights and 2 days at the Hotel Monaco,Chicago in October 2014. It was awesome! We had our Golden Doodle dog ""Juno"" with us and the staff made us all feel welcome and special! Sheila, Rich, Antonio,Liz, David, and Frances really stood out for their customer focus and people skills. The room was clean, nicely decorated, everything worked! The shower had a high ceiling (we are tall and really like that) with great water pressure and lots of hot water! The queen beds were really comfy. Though it was located in the busy downtown Loop area, it was quiet and we slept well. This boutique hotel is perfectly located, beautifully decorated, clean and the staff are really customer focused.They are really pet friendly- they do NOT charge extra for your pet and provide a gift bag,and food and water bowls. Wine hour in the lobby at 5 p.m. every evening is a lovely experience, we got to meet really interesting and friendly fellow guests. We will definitely stay here when we return to Chicago again!! Great value for money and excellent quality!!",nan,nan,ta_s293
trip_advisor,"I didn't spend too much time in my room because I was at a conference - it seemed quiet, comfortable and clean. What really made me a real fan: a fleet of bicycles (free) allowed me to ride to and from the McCormick Center along the Lakeshore bike path. Helmet and lock included. I also appreciated the option of Chicago Tribune, USA Today, NY Times and WSJ at the coffee bar.The wine hour brought many people together in the lobby and encouraged a social atmosphere that was fun. Every single person working there was helpful and friendly. Can't say enough",nan,nan,ta_s294
trip_advisor,The Monaco in Chicago lived up to the high expectations I have come to have for Kimpton properties. Our room with 2 queen beds was spacious enough. The staff was attentive and prompt when we needed anything. We also very much enjoyed the evening wine reception in the lobby. On our last day we had a big group brunch at South Water Kitchen. The food was great and they had no problem accommodating our large group.,nan,nan,ta_s295
trip_advisor,"Read reviews on TripAdvisor for Hotel Monaco while planning a weekend trip to Chicago. Loved the idea of the fish bowl and wine hour, so I booked a room. I was not dissapointed! The rooms are so cozy and clean. Most comfortable bed. Staff was so genuinely friendly!! Wine hour in their comfy lobby was a great way to relax and meet other guests. It's little added touches like this that makes a hotel stand out! Thank you Hotel Monaco for an amazing stay!",nan,nan,ta_s296
trip_advisor,"Just returned from a week in Chicago. The first half of the week was for work and in a ""work"" hotel. The second half was personal and we spent it at the Monaco.While the first hotel was fine - everything was okay there was nothing of actual note to make you remember the hotel.Then we moved to the Monaco and upon walking in it was a completely different world. The staff was friendly and helpful. The room was insanely cool -- especially the window seat! Never thought I'd be into it but it was nice to be able to sit there (with PLENTY of room for two) and look down at the river and watch Chicago go by for a bit.We went down to the wine hour and when we got back to our room there was a welcome amenity, sent up by Ericka Kouba that had a few local things to share with us since it was our first time in Chicago. Again, the little things that suddenly make the Monaco heads and tails from where we'd been earlier in the week.Throughout the week the various staff members we talked with were friendly, remembered us and always had a minute to talk.The final part that reaffirmed why we are dedicated Kimpton devotees was that the fan in our room went out the afternoon of the last day we were there. Things happen, machines break. We called and within minutes maintenance was in our room and checking it out. It took not time to determine that the fan wasn't going to come back to life -- 4 hours to repair. We were more than happy to hang tight knowing we'd have air soon enough and told management it wasn't an issue. The phone rang 10 minutes later and we were moved to a suite for the last night with apologies for the inconvenience! Talk about taking an unfortunate situation and not only making the best of it but making sure you have clientele that will come back again and again.Thanks to EVERYONE at the Monaco for a very memorable first visit to Chicago, maintenance (who was awesome and did get the a/c back up and running as we talked with him the next morning) and to Ericka Kouba for making sure we have a great visit. (Say Hi to ""Emily"" for me!)",nan,nan,ta_s297
trip_advisor,"What a special place! Old world charm meets new world amenities. In looking for an upscaled, downtown Chicago hotel and wanted something convenient to all the major shops, eateries and the lake, I found it all here. My room wasn't available at check-in, so I changed in the hotel restroom, left my luggage with the valet and went for a run along Lake Shore. Upon return, my room was ready. It was clean, tastefully furnished, complete with the fun, eclectic Kimpton touches .. animal print robes, $10 raid the bar credit, etc. A few minutes after settling in, a knock on the door produced a porter who presented me with a bottle of wine and a fruit tray .. as an apology for not having my room ready upon my arrival. Now that's what I call service, considering I checked in before the posted check-in time! At 5 pm, the evening wine hour was met with many interesting guests and servers. Another interesting touch is that the wine steward changes. Could be the valet, the bellman, someone from reception or the back office. I enjoy getting to know the entire Kimpton staff. Speaking of staff .. every member was friendly, accommodating and greeted with a hello .. and how can I help you? The valet was, by far, my favorite, however. Always a friendly smile, an opened door and a ""thank you for staying with us .. how can I assist you?"" (This occurred every time I entered or left.) Made me feel like royalty, even when I came in dripping with sweat from a long run. I would recommend staying here for anyone.The only downside was the downtown noise and something going on in the floor above my room. The odd thing is I was staying on the top floor (and there's no banquet room, etc., above my room), so not sure what that was about?? Sounded like kids running amok in the middle of the night. For the light sleepers, I recommend ear plugs. Otherwise, it was a perfect stay at another Kimpton establishment!",nan,nan,ta_s298
trip_advisor,"We had a great time at this hotel. The rooms were VERY clean, and well appointed. I loved the robes, the yoga mat in the room, and the decor was very chic. The high quality hair dryer was awesome, and there was lovely soap and shampoos. The black out curtains were great, and I loved the height of the room, and how gorgeously it was decorated. Our linens were crisp and clean, the pillows and king bed were delightful. The hotel itself was centrally located. We were in town for marathon weekend, and the concierge was helpful with special breakfast options starting at 4am, and directions to the race. The selection of teas and coffees in the lounge in the morning were yummy, and the iced lemon and cucumber waters were a delicious afternoon option. I would stay at the Monaco again in a heartbeat. A+ experience.",nan,nan,ta_s299
trip_advisor,"Hotel Monaco is a fantastic hotel; friendly staff, fantastic location great rooms (quiet despite the busy location), good modern gym facilities (loved the hula hoop), and wine time between 5 and 6 is a great idea (although we were only at the hotel during this time when we checked in. Complementary robes in the room were fun too; we had a zebra and cheetah.Only grumble would be that there are no do not disturb signs so the house keeping staff knock on the door in the morning, relatively early, between 8 and 9. We were on our way out each time so it was not a problem for us but if we had wanted to sleep in this would have been a little irritating.",nan,nan,ta_s300
trip_advisor,"I booked this hotel from the road on the afternoon before i arrived. My choice was based on tripadvisor ratings and price.Upon arrival, i asked for a ""nice room"" (which i always do), and i got top floor with riverview. I think this is probably one of the best rooms possible. Direct view to Trump Tower and a little reclining area in the window. There was a bottle of champagne (most likely by mistake) in a cooler in the room so i called reception about this. They told me it was mine now... good start for a friday night.I asked for dinner options and got a few good recommendations, within walking distance.Next morning, i had to ship some goods with UPS and the concierge Sheila was extremely helpful and friendly with this.Altogether, i was very pleasantly surprised by the service and friendliness i got for the price, compared to other 4 star hotels in chicago. I will go back anytime and will recommend this hotel to all my friends.",nan,nan,ta_s301
trip_advisor,"We stayed at the hotel Monaco 22nd to 27th May and had a wonderful stay.We were there for our honeymoon and they upgraded us to an even nicer room with a lovely view of the river.The hotel was clean and staff friendly. Especially the concierge who wished us a nice day whenever we went out.The hotel was in the best location in downtown, easy to get to from the CTA train traveling from airport and easy to walk to Lincoln park, magnificent mile, beach/lake shore trail and to soldier field, field museum.Would definitely stay again. It was brilliant.",nan,nan,ta_s303
trip_advisor,"Our four days at the Hotel Monaco were absolutely perfect. The staff could not have been more helpful and friendly...we were given wonderful advice and recommendations from the concierge. We loved the cocktail hour in the late afternoon with free wine and treats. The location is brilliant with nearly all major sights (Michigan Avenue, Millenium Park, River North, etc.) within walking distance. My favorite aspect of the hotel however was the room. The beds were deliciously comfortable. The window seat was a perfect spot to read and watch boats float down the river. The decor was tasteful and unique. Plus, the goldfish was a great touch. Out of all the hotels I have stayed at in Chicago the Hotel Monaco is by far my favorite.",nan,nan,ta_s304
trip_advisor,"Just returned from a Chicago weekend based at the Monaco and was fully satisfied. Room was spacious, well-appointed and spotless. Staff was very accomodating and professional and the restaurant served an excellent brunch (plus a free wine reception every day) Be sure to join their free club to get free wi-fi and a $10 voucher for the bar or mini-bar. Valet parked is $56 per day and you can save by self-parking at several lots within a block. Hotel is easily walkable to many attractions including the Art Institute and shopping.",nan,nan,ta_s305
trip_advisor,"We had a great stay Friday - Sunday of Memorial Day weekend at the Hotel Monaco. Had Room 1108 which had cool window seats and a great view of Marina City -- the two sixty story concrete towers which mix parking and unique architecture, as well as the new Trump tower thing.Hotel Monaco is charming and comfortable. Sleep quality is quite high -- we could hear the El wheels squeaking but we got right to sleep -- that wasn't that loud. Water pressure in the showers is terrific. Service and cleanliness of rooms was five stars for us. Front desk, bell stand, etc. very Midwestern courteous. A true pleasure. I think we dealt with about 8 different hotel employees and never heard a cross word or experienced inefficiency -- they fell over themselves helping us out.Business center was great. The printer was one of the best I've ever had in a hotel experience. The Hotel Monaco has a usage charge thing which is a bit obnoxious, but if you brought your laptop you could use the metered computer gizmo just for printing. Again, the printer quality in color was outstanding, enabling us to print off a variety of google maps for tourism in chicago.TIP: Request the in-room Keurig coffee maker. That's a nice wake up cup of Joe. We ate at the restaurant for brunch on Sunday. Did a great job with bacon, omelette was OK. Probably the weakest aspect of our stay. The charge on the parking overnight is like $56, but that's downtown Chicago.Overall, fantastic stay. It is great to be at a comfortable, smaller hotel. We really liked the location. Easy walking distance to Michigan Avenue, Navy Pier, etc. And I enjoyed looking at the Bob Newhart Marina City towers at day or night. Also, it is amazing how cleaned up downtown Chicago is now. Very gentrified. Great riverwalk, etc. We had a terrific visit. Thank you Kimpton.",nan,nan,ta_s306
trip_advisor,"I stayed here for four nights in May. Its location, on Wabash at the Chicago River is, to me, perfect for walking all around Chicago. River North, Michigan Avenue, State Street, the Loop, Millenium Park, etc. are all within easy walking distance. The Blue Line direct from the airport drops nearby (at Clark and Lake), so it is convenient to get there using mass transit.Once at the hotel, I was upgraded to a beautiful one-bedroom suite (I am a Kimpton Inner Circle member). The suite, overlooking the Chicago River, was beautifully decorated, quiet, and a serene place to reside while in Chicago. The views from the 4 (yes four, three large (they are about the size of a full-size bed (no lie), one smaller) window seats were amazing. A friend and I sat in them late every night and enjoyed wine and cheese.The bath had a whirpool tub and stand-up shower. My own personal preference would be to have had a slightly larger shower in the room (and I prefer showers that also include a hand-held shower head as well), but it is an older building (like most Kimptons) that has been retrofitted for a new life (and beautifully done).The staff, like almost all Kimptons, was welcoming and friendly. They all sought to make my stay memorable and enjoyable. This began with emails from Erica, the assistant manager (a big shout out to her!), prior to my arrival through every person at the hotel.If you have not stayed at a Kimpton Hotel, you should. And if your trip takes you to Chicago, Hotel Monaco is a superb choice. I highly recommend it.",nan,nan,ta_s307
trip_advisor,"Foster is a really nice check-in person who made sure our first stay at a Kimpton Hotel was a pleasant experience. Our room has two bay windows overlooking the Chicago River. It keeps our boys (under 10) occupied. The decor is very mismatched. The bathroom definitely could use some extra storage for toiletries and a change of clothes. Rich, the concierge was irritated with our request for help with our dinner reservation. After spending 8 hours traveling, patience and a helpful attitude is most appreciated. Rich needs to work on this.",nan,nan,ta_s308
trip_advisor,"Great staff here and the potential for excellence, however my first night was way below par. We hired a suite (not inexpensive) but in spite of assurances that the sofa-bed would be made up in readiness from my return from supper, we had to chase and chase to get this implemented. Have to say the quality of the sofa-bed was more budget hotel/motel than up-market boutique. Shame, because, it's in a great location with great staff.",nan,nan,ta_s309
trip_advisor,"My teenage daughter and I stayed at the Hotel Monaco for a long weekend. It was the perfect choice! She absolutely loved the window seat and view. The hotel staff brought her a down comforter and blankets so she could sleep in it! The entire staff, from the front door to room service, were friendly and accommodating. The location is excellent for shopping, shows, and museums. We have found our Chicago hotel!",nan,nan,ta_s310
trip_advisor,I truly enjoyed my stay at the Hotel Monaco. The hotel is very well located. Shops are about two blocks away and a number of restaurants nearby. The rooms are very comfortable and immaculate as far as cleanliness. There is a complimentary wine reception every night from 5:00 to 6:00 pm which is a great place to gather. The ambiance is warm and the staff is very friendly and helpful!,nan,nan,ta_s311
trip_advisor,"We chose Hotel Monaco because of the great reviews and location. We were not disappointed with the location, but found the reviews overrated. Having grown up in the Midwest, I visit my ""hometown"" of Chicago 2-3 times (4-7 day stays) a year and have stayed at many hotels in the downtown area. We chose Monaco this visit for the boutique-ness and the window seats seen from the street.PROS: Extremely nice and quick room service, usually a 15-20 wait and smiling, friendly deliverers. Welcoming door staff, always waiting with a ""hello!"". Nice greeting by desk person upon arrival, we arrived at 11am and got a room by noon. Clean room and excellent maid service. Comfy beds, linens, and pillows. CONS: Not a single ""good morning"" or ""good evening"" greeting from the front desk staff during our entire stay...wow. I initiated a ""good morning"" one day and got blank stares. How difficult is it to greet your customers when they pass by? Called for bell service after our 7-night stay to store luggage before our flight time, waited over 20 minutes, finally lugged our heavy bags (lotsa shopping this trip!) to the lobby ourselves only to see 2 bell staff doing nothing. Front desk staff was somewhat apologetic. Expensive room service, but that's the big city for ya. Honestly felt a bit unwelcome, which we found ridiculous in a small boutique hotel; Usually only encounter this type of unfriendly customer service in larger chains. Probably will not choose Monaco for future stays because we didn't feel welcome any time after arrival; too bad because everything else was nice.",nan,nan,ta_s312
trip_advisor,"We LOVED this hotel. My main concern when staying in hotels is cleanliness and I have to say that this hotel room was spotless. While the room was on the smaller side, it is a boutique hotel and the small size was not at all a problem for us. The window seats are AMAZING. We found ourselves sitting and looking out most of the time we were in the room. We slept with the sheer curtains open so that if we woke we had an amazing view. We stayed on the 11th floor. The service from EVERYONE in this hotel was excellent. Our car was brought around promptly each time we requested it. We didn't have a chance to go to the wine hour as we were out both nights we stayed at that time. Location is wonderful! Upon checkout we noticed a charge from the mini bar that we didn't use and it was quickly taken care of. We have no complaints and will be back for sure. My husband forgot his toothbrush (lol) and as soon as it was requested one was brought right up. Need more towels....within a couple of minutes they were at the door. We booked directly through the hotel and got a great price. Parking is high but I looked around and there are some even higher. Personally we didn't mind the cost so much especially after the excellent service we received when requesting our car. I would recommend this hotel to anyone and already have. Perfectly lovely weekend stay and we were not ready to leave! Enjoy!P.S They really do put a goldfish in your room!!! So cute!",nan,nan,ta_s313
trip_advisor,"I stayed at the Kimpton Monaco in Chicago while attending a conference. It was a wonderful respite from the busy-ness of the conference. More than that, Matthew (front desk supervisor) and every single staff person made me feel welcomed and well cared for. I was greeted each time I entered and departed the premises, encouraged to attend the afternoon wine reception, reminded of morning coffee, and asked if there was anything they could do to make me more comfortable. The room was lovely; with a nice view of the river. It was quiet and serene. I especially appreciated the in-room yoga mat and wellness station; no need to leave the room to get my work-out in! The hotel is located in the heart of everything (restaurants, the art museum, parks). I just can't say enough about this place, it's staff, and the relaxing stay I enjoyed!",nan,nan,ta_s314

The Hotel staff was helpful but the rooms were pretty small.I have one complaint however regarding the Breakfast: It included just a Toast, an apple and a cup of tea. Since the Breakfast was included in the Price, it should at least be of proper quantity and variety.P.S: CHICAGO NOT RECOMMENDED FOR WINTER",nan,nan,ta_s316
trip_advisor,"My family visited Chicago (April 2014) for the weekend. We had a wonderful experience at the Hotel Monaco. The hotel is well located to walk everywhere we wanted to go (Institute of Art, American Girl store, etc.) The desk staff whet out of their way to make us (including my children) feel welcome. They were able to arrange a room with a window seat - a fantastic and unique feature. We were greeted and recognized smiles each time we came and went - it was almost like coming home. I travel often and stay in hotels all over the world. This was some of the best service I've experienced. On par with Peninsula, Ritz Carlton and Four Seasons hotels, although not as large and commercial feeling. My 11 year old (who has stayed in some very nice hotels commented that this was the nicest place she has ever stayed).

trip_advisor,"I stayed at the Hotel Monaco last week for a very short business trip; 1 night. I found the location to be conveniently located and the staff I encountered to be friendly and accomodating. My father lives in Milwaukee, but was unable to drive down, so he took the train. In looking for directions to the Union Station, Frances at the front desk heard me talking with another front desk host. When I arrived back at the hotel with my dad, she welcomed us with a ""This must be Dad!"", which thrilled my father. The room was clean and nicely furnished with very comfortable beds. If I had to find something to criticize, I'd say I could hear road traffic during rush hour even thought we were on the 7th floor, Riverview Room. We walked to Harry Carey's for a delightful dinner... and ate a delicious lunch at the South Water Grill. I saw an unfavorable review for the restaurant and was surprised. There were 2 others in my group that ate later and also thoroughly enjoyed their meals.Maybe it was the menu items?!? I'd also like to commend the Bellmen we encountered while there. Both were friendly and helpful, but one in particular (wish I had his name) declined my tip after hailing a cab for us stating that we'd already taken care of him earlier and he was happy to help! I was shocked someone was turning down cash.My only regret is I was unable to partake in the Kimpton free wine Happy Hour because I was working. Would definitely go back next time my travels take me to Chicago.",nan,nan,ta_s320
trip_advisor,"Hotel Monaco is an absolute jewel located conveniently to restaurants, Michigan Ave, and transportation on Wabash near Wacker Dr. I held a meeting for a small executive group with people from all parts of the US and we were very satisfied with the service and accommodations. Since the meeting was informal, I decided to rent a suite and hold the meeting in the living room portion of the room and this turned out to be a great choice. The lobby and common areas of the hotel have a fun and welcoming vibe with a friendly staff that make you feel at home. There is wifi access in the lobby with fun music in the background. Fresh Starbuck's offered gratis in the am and a complement of wines in the evening in the lobby. The concierge service was very helpful and offered up great ideas for dinners out and offered to make reservations. The rooms are appointed beautifully with comfy robes and striking bedding, furniture and accessories. We did not want to leave. The room service staff could not have been more helpful (for one request all we needed was a few spoons and waters and the delivery person could not have been nicer). We dined at sister hotels, the Burnham and Allegro and enjoyed those locales as well. What a treasure!",nan,nan,ta_s321
trip_advisor,"I stayed here for 2 night with my husband in January - right as the polar vortex was hitting Chicago! Rooms were clean and warm, and the bed was very comfortable. The bellman was very helpful - taught us about falling ice and what buildings you should walk right next to and which you should walk closer to the street, so as not to get hit with the falling ice. A close walking distance to the Mag Mile, the ""Bean"" at Millennium Park, etc. The voucher for the mini bar was an added plus. I wouldn't hesitate to stay here again!",nan,nan,ta_s322
trip_advisor,"Everyone at this hotel and its restaurant, South Water Kitchen, were very friendly and helpful. We were always greeted when we walked in the door. The doorman always opened the door and got taxis when we needed them. The concierge made good suggestions about restaurants and got us reservations. Staff at the front desk were friendly and helpful, too. The 5PM wine reception in the lobby was an opportunity to talk to other guests, which we always like to do. The location is very convenient to the things that we wanted to do in Chicago. Bed and room were very comfortable and the room was quiet.

First, I love dogs, so it was nice to see so many animals around. The decor was just beautiful, the staff very nice and helpful, and the room was clean and comfortable.

I will come back!",nan,nan,ta_s324
trip_advisor,"stayed here for a conference. Room was nice and big. Liked the entryway into my room. Gave it a two room feel. Bathroom was off this foyer type area. Tall sink, great water pressure and plenty of hot water. The shower head was also well above my head. Always a plus. Room was very clean and decently stocked mini-bar. Not just food products but also some items you may have forgotten. Side note, some of those should have been free, I.e toothbrush, toothpaste, those are provided at other upscale hotels if a guest is forgetful. Conference room was comfortable and the lunches were your basic conference foods. Filling but just okay. Room 702 does face a parking garage and a wall so not much of a view on my side. Also, the wine tasting ends at 6 on the dot. the room was full and at 6 the wine was taken away. So dont linger if you want to get a glass. When i am in town i may stay here again.",nan,nan,ta_s325
trip_advisor,"We've stayed at the Hotel Palomar, another Kimpton Hotel in Chicago, and loved it. Every staff member we met was very friendly, helpful and professional. When we left, we felt like we were leaving new friends, and we looked forward to seeing them again.This was not the case at the Hotel Monaco. The only outstanding staff member was the day shift valet person (I wish I remembered his name). He was friendly and informative from our first greeting to our departure two days later. The front desk was aloof. Once we checked in, we passed the front desk numerous times and they didn't acknowledge, let alone greet us. The concierge was not very helpful. Upon departure we called the front desk and asked for our car from the valet. After quite some time in the lobby, it became obvious our car had not been called up. The only person that seemed concerned about this, was the aforementioned valet person. I'm sure what makes such a dramatic difference in the level of service. It must either be hiring practices, training, management, or a combination. The Palomar is doing something very right and it makes us want to go gack. The Monaco is just another hotel in Chicago to us, and with the host of hotel options in Chicago, I doubt we will ever go back. We've stayed in Holiday Inn Expresses at half the price that had more enthusiastic, helpful and friendly staff than the Monaco. We've stayed at The Trump, Waldorf-Astoria and Ritz-Carlton for twice the price and the staff at the Palomar were every bit as good.The highlight of the Monaco was the padded window ledges. Very nice to sit in, and a very unique feature for hotels in town. It may just be our perception, but the bathroom tile and shower seemed older than the rest of the room. The room was a nice size and it was clean. The beds were too hard for our tastes, and we like firm beds.The location is fantastic. Everything we wanted to do seemed to be within a ten minute walk. We wish we had better news, and as In Touch members we would like to love all Kimpton hotels.

trip_advisor,"Stayed here March 22 - 26 on business, and we had such a great time! My office was hosting an event at their restaurant, South Water Kitchen, so we negotiated a deal on the rooms. Since we hosted an event here, the rooms were pretty affordable. My room had an amazing view of the city, and while my colleague's room did not, she got a nice couch to make up for it. I got new shampoos and soaps every single day, regardless of whether or not I was finished with the last one. Also, I asked for a lint roller from the front desk, and I got a huge, full-size one. Nice!Onto the service. Before I even came to the hotel, I was contacted by someone in reservations to ask if we had any special occasion for being there. I mentioned that we were on business but a colleague of mine was retiring this year, and could they do something nice for her room. Upon check-in, my retiring colleague was met with a bottle of wine and some cake. Very nice! Also, I had asked if we could have some of our conference supplies shipped directly to the hotel since the conference storage fees were really excessive. They held on to our supplies for a few days prior to our arrival, no extra charge. Fantastic! Also, everyone I talked to at the front desk and at the wine hour (which was from 5 - 6PM daily) was really nice. They usually say ""Welcome back!"" or ""Have a great day!"" every time you come back or leave the hotel, which is sweet. Matthew at the front desk was our favorite. My colleagues and I had nice long chats with him about the city, places to go eat, life in general, etc. Nice guy. We had a great time at the Hotel Monaco and will likely be back next year!",nan,nan,ta_s327
trip_advisor,"Stayed here for a business conference at the McCormick centre. Great location, close to the river and an easy walk to trains, restaurants and shopping. Cab fare to the conference was reasonable under $10. The hotel was well appointed and the beds were comfortable. Service was OK. The only downside was that they took a $900 reserve on my credit card at check in, and then charged a further $700 + on departure. The $900 isnt returned to the card until days later. Pretty hard to check in for 3 days without at least $2000 available on your card.",nan,nan,ta_s328
trip_advisor,"We stayed at the hotel Monaco for a weekend getaway. It was a wonderful hotel with great service and a great location. We took advantage of an off season price, making this a good value, throw in the complimentary wine happy hour and free wifi and it's a great deal! Rooms are spacious and comfortable. Bathroom is a little tight but it's a boutique hotel. My son has moved up to Chicago and I plan to visit him often. Hope to make Hotel Monaco, my go to hotel!",nan,nan,ta_s329
trip_advisor,"I stayed at this location via a company sponsored training. The location is great!! Downtown, where everything is within walking distance, so convenient. The room was clean, staff was very attentive and hospitable. Complimentary coffee & tea was available each morning as was complimentary wine at the end of the day, which was greatly appreciated. I loved the robes provided and the umbrella, as it rained two days in a row. My stay was great! The only thing that I can complain about was the construction happening next door. I was not as lucky as my co-worker to get a view of the river, instead I had a view of the construction site. There was notification of the construction going on from 8-5, but on most days the construction started at 6'ish. I know they don't have much control of that. Overall my stay was fabulous! I'd certainly stay here again!",nan,nan,ta_s330
trip_advisor,"The Hotel Monaco is a solid choice in downtown Chicago whether you are visiting for business or for pleasure. It's an easy walk to anywhere in the Loop and also to the shopping on North Michigan Ave. The hotel has window seats with lovely views of the river, and the best part is that the view (at least from my room) excluded that new Trump monstrosity across the way. Instead I got to admire the classic Chicago structures of Marina City (the corn cob-looking buildings) and the Mies van der Rohe-designed IBM building next door.",nan,nan,ta_s331
trip_advisor,"We stayed for two nights in early March. The location in the loop and across the river from the Magnificent Mile made it a great place to experience what Chicago has to offer. The room was very tastefully decorated. The wine hour was lovely and the hostess was very nice to chat with. The bar that is attached is also very nice. We stopped for a quick drink and appetizer. The service was good and the drinks even better. We always got a cab fast in front of the hotel.Only complaint I would have is to train staff to not air their grievances to guests. I called the day before I checked in to see if I would receive an early check in that was offered through the Kimpton rewards program. The gentleman who answered the call literally sighed after I asked my question and proceeded for two minutes to tell me why the early check in was not honored and it shouldn't be offered. I couldn't believe I sat through this conversation to be honest. I was willing to pay to get in early after riding the train to the city all night, I just needed to know if it was available. Since we took it as we could not get early check in, we stopped to drop our bags after our arrival and found out they where able to get us in a room early! The service at this point made up for the conversation the day before.We would stay here again, just wish the gentleman who answered the phone would be more professional in the future.",nan,nan,ta_s332
trip_advisor,"A group of friends and we made this a base for a fun night of St. Patrick's Day festivities. I've stayed at several downtown hotels and this one now leads the pack. It has a bit of a swanky feel but not over the top. Staff are attentive and friendly. Rooms are very uniquely decorated and inviting, some with amazing city & river views with window sill seating. The location is excellent, north side of the loop on the river and close to River North. Although we missed it, they have a complimentary wine reception every day as well as free bike rentals. Another bonus is the attached Sweetwater Tavern & Grille. It has a great vibe and where we enjoyed late night drinks as well as a delicious breakfast. The clincher was that we were able to get a great rate, one of the lowest of all the 4-5 star hotels in downtown. Stay here. You won't be disappointed!",nan,nan,ta_s333
trip_advisor,"The decoration of the room is really stylish. It's not just modern but with a nice touch of exotic flavor. I particularly like the huge bay window which you can sleep there for street (people) watching. The location is great and right in the heart of Chicago. The night I stayed not only had an evening wine tour but also accompanied with music and band. The bed is very comfy and the shower has great water pressure. The room is very clean and everything is in great condition. Compared to most of the other hotels, it has some unexpected touch of details. There is a Yoga mat for guest to practice Yoga. In their TV program there are free Yoga lessons you can follow. In the morning there are free coffees and tea. This is a great hotel that I recommend.",nan,nan,ta_s334
trip_advisor,"My teenage son and I stayed in a room at the Monaco late last summer for a mini vacation.The room was wonderful with a great view of the river. The property is very clean, modern and the staff is great. Perfect location for getting around on foot or transit.I have stayed at various properties in Chicago and have to say this is the most preferred. Would recommend without hesitation and will be returning. As a bonus I actually booked thru Priceline so the room rate was a steal.",nan,nan,ta_s335
trip_advisor,"Stayed two nights and it was spectacular! Hotel staff was very nice, friendly, and very attentive. Friends birthday and we got fruit, water, and a birthday card signed by the staff. What a personal touch. Shout out to Mike who was wonderful! Foster was awesome as well. Everyone was, you can't go wrong! Stayed on 8th floor, great view! Irish pub across the street. Magnificent mile within walking distance. Restaurant attached was too pricey for our taste. Window seat in hotel room was great for people watching. 7-11 across the street, I recommend for munchies and beer. We will stay here again.",nan,nan,ta_s336
trip_advisor,"We stayed at the Hotel Monaco to celebrate our anniversary. We had a lovely river front room. Not knowing it was St. Pat's Day weekend, we woke up see the Chicago River turn green right before our eyes from our hotel window! The front desk staff were so professional and welcoming as were the staff at the complimentary cocktail hour. We even enjoyed our little goldfish friend! Thanks for making our anniversary a special one!


Green Features: I appreciate the thought given to be environmentally friendly. The opportunity to re-cycle was refreshing! Thanks!",nan,nan,ta_s337
trip_advisor,"I hadn't tried this hotel before but booked it for two after some recent less-than-stellar experiences at other Chicago establishments. We liked the professional treatment, the intriguing decor of the room, and the small luxuries: padded window seats, bathrobes and slippers provided, multiple newspapers as well as tea, coffee, and water available down in the lobby, and complimentary wine hour. I didn't get to try out the fitness center but was impressed by its spaciousness. Breakfast in the adjoining restaurant was fast and tasty. Just a couple of small reservations: wireless internet was not free, at least to a first-timer, and there seemed to be no privacy sign available to hang on the door handle and the housekeeper knocked at what seemed to us an excessively early hour on the morning of our checkout. Nevertheless, I'd definitely stay here again.",nan,nan,ta_s339
trip_advisor,"I was tremendously pleased with the Hotel Monaco. I was in Chicago on business (in February! And I hate winter...) I became suddenly sick with flu-like symptoms. The staff was both efficient, and kind and made what could have been a terrible experience quite nice. The staff were friendly without being intrusive and were very knowledgeable of the hotel and Chicago.The room was spacious, and the bed was very comfortable. I had a federal rate, but for once didn't get stuck with the worst room (the small, dark, terrible view, last room on the hall). The location of the hotel itself couldn't be beat -- close to everything.I have already recommended the hotel to friends who travel to Chicago on a regular basis, and look forward to returning -- when I'm feeling well and can take advantage of the wine tasting and what looked to be a very nice restaurant.",nan,nan,ta_s340
trip_advisor,"This was our second stay at a Kimpton property and we were again blown away. We had a king room with a wonderful view down to the river from the comfort of our secluded day bed. The real bed was very comfortable, the furnishings are iconic and fitting of the property and the staff were beyond helpful. Location was within walking distance of almost everything that we were interested in doing and we felt safe walking around during the day and night. Also the proximity to the two train stations meant that we were very self sufficient during our stay. A basket of fruit on arrival, a fish to look after while we were there and some great restaurant recommendations really cemented Hotel Monaco's place in our hearts. We will be visiting again.",nan,nan,ta_s341
trip_advisor,"Everything was as good as I expected, nice clean, friendly envitoment, showers can use some improvement, I'm 5'11 and I consider that an standard height, but I couldn't reach the shower head for adjustment, totally out of my reach, it was at least another foot and half from my finger tips, other than that we were satified with the service.",nan,nan,ta_s342
trip_advisor,"We stayed here for 6 nights. Would recommend travelers consider this kitschy hotel. The location in the loop and across the river from the Magnificent Mile made it a great place to experience what Chicago has to offer. It has a trendy feel, bold colours and personable staff. The wine reception each night a 5 was an added bonus. The bed was comfortable and floor very quiet. You could hear a low rumble of the ""L"" but we got used to that. We thought it was a very good value given the location. Of course, the was February so maybe this contributed to the reasonable cost.",nan,nan,ta_s343
trip_advisor,"My husband and I live in Madison, WI and travel often to Chicago for weekend trips. We have always wanted to stay in this hotel, so when I saw a sale for a weekend we were already planning to go to Chicago, I jumped at the chance to book this hotel. I'm glad I did! It is a beautiful boutique hotel filled with a lot of neat features. I received an e-mail about a week prior to our stay, asking if there were any upgrades I wanted to sign up for (with no guarantee, but it was still neat to see what they had available). When we checked in, we were upgraded to a ""high rise floor."" Our room was beautifully appointed and was... large! I was not expecting that much space for a hotel in downtown Chicago. The rooms also were considered ""tall rooms"" with high ceilings. This was great because my husband and I are both pretty tall (I'm 5'10"" and my husband is 6'3""), and the room even had a very tall shower!The hotel is also pet friendly, which is great. I unfortunately have extreme allergies to cats and was concerned about this. But, I notified the hotel before checking in, and we were placed in a pet-free room (confirmed to me by the hotel manager). I didn't see a single animal on our floor the whole weekend (and saw quite a few in the lobby, so I was pleased to know our room was safe).We ordered room service both mornings and the food was pretty tasty. I really appreciated all the healthy options (i.e. whole grain breads/waffles).The location was great and we had a lovely time! We look forward to visiting again soon!",nan,nan,ta_s344
trip_advisor,"I have been traveling to Chicago on business for years, and I always stay at Monaco. I love the free wine reception in the evening, and the ambiance of the lobby. There is free coffee and tea every morning as well, and I Love that too! The hotel staff and Concierge are awesome! The rooms are very clean and comfortable. My only complaint would be the floor layout...the bathroom doors are very awkward in most of the rooms. When you enter the bathroom the door butts up to toilet, making it a tight fit to get in and out. I have stayed at other hotels in the Loop, but I always come back to Monaco.",nan,nan,ta_s345
trip_advisor,"I recently was surprised this past weekend with a nights stay here for my birthday. I was told the room we stayed in was the best in the building, and I wouldn't disagree. The room's amenities included a giant comfy king bed, two televisions (one in the sitting room and one in the bedroom) and deep seated hot tub, and an AMAZING view. Each window is fitted with cushion seat, so you can crawl up into the window and really see everything. The staff was wonderful, I can't count how many people greeted me and told me ""Happy Birthday,"" it was really sweet. There is also a happy hour from 5-6 where they offer free cocktails to their guests. I was seriously impressed with my stay and would recommend it to anyone.",nan,nan,ta_s346
trip_advisor,"I am a big fan of Kimpton hotels and this one is one of my favorites. The location is wonderful - central location so you can walk many places and quick access to ""the L"". A horrendous plane trip end caused us to be almost 12 hours late, but a call to the front desk assured us that a room with our preferences would be waiting, and it was. The room itself is pretty basic, though quite comfortable (the pillows are great), but it is the little things that make this hotel. The sitting area in the lobby is inviting, the wine hour at the end of the day is a great way to transition to evening events, and the recommendations by the staff on local places to eat were spot on - in short, great personal service and amenities at a price that is below the big hotels. Throw in free wifi if you join their InTouch program, and this is an outstanding value.",nan,nan,ta_s347
trip_advisor,"Room service menu is very limited. I'm staying here a week so this is a problem, it's like being at a local dive in the middle of nowhere. I called for room service at 9pm, was told they'd call me back (7 minutes later and after I got undressed), they did. I tried to order but they closed. It says on their menu they serve dinner until 10pm - but, ""There was nobody in here so we closed it two hours early."" (at 8pm vs. 10pm, as stated on the menu), without warning. They offered to go across the street to get me food at a bar, but I don't eat fried bar food. It's nearly 10pm, no food available and unimpressed. At 9:48pm, I would have been finished with dinner by now and getting ready for bed. Now, I will be up late and have to eat at 10:30pm. Not a good time to eat or way to start the work week. Not a great experience. Bye Kimpton Hotels!",nan,nan,ta_s348
trip_advisor,"the I stayed for four nights on a business trip. The hotel is conveniently located both for Downtown/South Loop and a short walk to the shopping on North Michigan Ave. My room was very nice (1217) - the view was nothing much to write home about, but everything else was great. If you join the InTouch programme you get free internet and a $10 credit for the mini bar. Front desk staff and doorman were on the whole very friendly and provided great service. Wine hour was a nice touch. Two recommendations: a coffee machine in the rooms would be good, without having to ask for it (a machine was provided very promptly when I asked), and when I requested a later check out on the morning of my last day the person to whom I spoke was rather snitty and said I could check out at 3pm for a $50 payment. As it was a Sunday and many people seemed to be checking out I thought that was unreasonable. We ate in the South Water Kitchen restaurant - decor was nothing to write home about and the windows were dirty, but the food was lovely and the service friendly. I will definitely stay at the Monaco if I return to Chicago.",nan,nan,ta_s349
trip_advisor,"This is the best hotel at which I have stayed in Chicago. The room was large and comfortable and well decorated. Front desk was efficient and helpful. We checked in before 1 PM and that was no problem. Housekeeping was very efficient. Our room was cleaned before noon on all four days. The doormen were amazing. They had our bags out of the trunk and on the way to the front desk before we were out of the taxi. Same when we were leaving, they took them from us at the desk. Also as it was snowing much of this visit yet they managed to always keep the sidewalk and driveway clear. As with other Kimpton hotels the 5-6 wine hour is the highlight of the day. Good wine, nice snacks and an opportunity to relax in the lobby and meet other guests. I will definitely return next time I visit Chicago.",nan,nan,ta_s350
trip_advisor,"I travel 5-15 days per month and stay in my fair share of hotels. However, I always look forward to my trips to Chicago because it's like going home to visit family when I stay at the Hotel Monaco Chicago. The service is outstanding, the rooms are relaxing and comfortable, the staff is extremely friendly and treats you like an MVP every time you're there. If you're a Kimpton Hotel member you get $10 of treats from the mini-bar for free and the free nights add up quickly with the Kimpton In-Touch rewards program.Hotel Monaco Chicago is truly my home-away-from-home!",nan,nan,ta_s351
trip_advisor,"I love this boutique hotel. My room was really comfortable and clean. I was on the 6th floor and could hear some traffic, but overall it was really quiet. I couldn't hear other guests at all. I echo other reviewers when I say spending the extra money for a river view is well worth it. Grab a hot toddy from the lobby (free between 5 & 6) then climb in to your window seat (giant and more like a bed than a seat) and enjoy the river and Chicago architecture. I also liked being in the loop near State street and tons of public transportation. Also, easy to walk down Michigan Avenue north to shopping and restaurants.",nan,nan,ta_s352
trip_advisor,"Just returned from a long weekend trip to Chicago to celebrate my daughter's 18th Birthday. I surprised her with a surprise girls weekend for just the two of us. This was my first time staying at the Monaco as well as my first stay with a Kimpton Hotel. I must say I am impressed with the brand and will likely seek out Kimpton hotels for future stays. I reserved a double queen river view room. We arrived around 10pm (late due to delays in Cleveland). The front desk staff were very friendly. They said happy birthday to my daughter and let me know that we have complimentary wifi since we are Kimpton In touch members. It just takes a few minutes to become a member and it's free, so I highly recommend everyone do that before you go. You are also able to complete room preferences as well. Additionally, I recommend everyone ""like"" the Kimpton Hotels facebook page. You will also find out about some great little incentives by liking them. I found out that sometimes, Kimpton has a ""secret"" word. If you reveal this secret word at check in - you get something special. For me it was a bottle of wine and a fruit basket (both were great). Now, back to our stay :)We were checked in quickly and on our way to our room which was on the 14th floor. We enter the room and there is a gift bag and a card for my daughter. The gift bag is filled with a Chicago coffee cup and some candy goodies. The card is a cute little birthday card signed by the employees. I thought this was really thoughtful. I was a little disappointed that there wasn't a goldfish (as I know she would have thought that was so cool - but she didn't know about them anyway so no harm no foul). I then pointed out the window seats to her and she LOVED them! Actually, she loved everything about our room (including the animal print robes). So, if you are going with teenagers or young adult (actually, I am certain small children would LOVE those window seats as well) you can't really go wrong. Did I mention our view? Well, it was spectacular!! I wish I would have had time to sit in the window seat and just read and enjoy the view more! The room was very clean (and I inspect everything). The bathroom was larger than I expected (based on the online pics). I was especially concerned about there being a lack of counter space, but found it to be ample. There was more than enough room for a curling iron, hair dryer and waver, as well as make up bags, hair spray, make up remover.....etc etc. Ladies, if you are contemplating bringing your hair dryer or not, I would recommend you bring. Especially if you are picky about them, as I am. The shampoos and soaps are C.O. Bigelow and I loved them. I personally have never tried them, but I buy their shaving cream for my husband and it's the only one that he will use. I think I might start buying them going forward for myself. The down pillows that I request in my profile for the kimpton in touch members were on both beds. Oh, and the beds......oh so comfortable! There is a mini refrigerator with soda and some wine, bottled water, beer etc. The only complaint I have and it's really not a complaint....more like an observation.....is that some areas need a little bit of love. There were a few cracked tiles in our bathroom that had missing pieces that could be replaced and some skuffs, etc along the walls as you are walking to your room. I am very picky about carpeting and found it to be very clean in our room, as well as the bathroom floors. Housekeeping was great. We put the do not disturb sign on our room and were not disturbed. When we left for the afternoon (one day after 1pm) our room was still serviced. The housekeeping staff even left a birthday cake (made of towels and wash cloths) one day for my daughter.We did order some food from the restaurant to take back up to our room. It was about 10:30 and they closed at 11. I didn't want to dine in and hold anyone up and asked if we could just order to go. They were very accommodating. We ordered the pulled pork sliders, a chicken flat bread pizza, some garlic fries and mussels for my daughter. They offered to carry it up to our room for us, but my daughter said she could carry it. The food was very good to meh. I LOVED the pulled pork sliders and would highly recommend. My daughter loves mussels (eww) and I tried one and determined again that they are just not for me. However, she loved them and it was a nice size portion. The chicken flatbread was really the only thing that fell short. It was just a little on the bland side. The staff inside the restaurant that we came in contact with were all very pleasant and I am certain you would have nothing less than excellent service while dining in the restaurant. On another note, one night we also had a sweet tooth and saw that they have chocolate chip cookies on their room service menu. We are slightly chocolate chip cookie snobs lol and so my daughter called down to inquire about the chocolate chip cookies. The person she spoke to made sure our cookies were made fresh for us (now I don't know if that is typical or if they bake them ahead of time). However, our cookies arrived to our room hot and they were good! Nothing better than warm chocolate chip cookies! It's little things like these that set this hotel brand apart from others. Their wine hour is great too. I only enjoyed it the night we were leaving, however it was really nice. There were red and white wine offerings and also a choice of Hot Toddy or warm cider. Being that it was 10 degrees outside, I was completely down with the Hot Toddy which was exactly what I needed to get warm and cozy. They were also serving some flatbread pizza at the time as well. The gentleman who was serving the drinks was extremely friendly and polite! On our last day there, our flight didn't leave until 9pm so they held our luggage for us. It was no problem for them to hold it and no issues getting it back! The doorman was very helpful to wave down a cab for you anytime you should need one and always there to greet you whenever you are coming or going and to answer any questions you might have. If you want to buy a few refreshments for your room, there is a 7-11 a 2 minute walk away. We had to visit as I do not drink coffee, but love my diet Dr. Pepper in the morning! The location of the hotel was great. About a $30 cab ride from Midway airport. No more than like 10-15 dollar cab ride to pretty much anywhere. We walked to Michigan Avenue easily. There is also a lowes theater nearby and we saw a late movie one night. The water tower, Hancock building, Navy Pier and museums are around an $8 cab ride (If I remember correctly). We were very happy with the location. Overall, we were very happy with our stay at Hotel Monaco and look forward to staying with a Kimpton hotel in the near future. Oh, and if anyone from Kimpton is reading this......Cleveland Ohio could use your hotel brand!!!",nan,nan,ta_s353
trip_advisor,"We stayed here for a weekend getaway to Chicago. An amazing property. The staff went above and beyond anything we have ever experienced at a hotel to help us celebrate our engagement. The room was clean, modern and the perfect space for our needs. Our room had a beautiful view of the river and downtown Chicago. The pet goldfish to greet us in the room was a plus too! The restaurant in the hotel was great, awesome innovative drinks. I had room service breakfast one morning. It come up quickly and was delicious. I loved our stay and would highly recommend this hotel to anyone staying in chicago! The price was very reasonable for the accommodations as well.

trip_advisor,"Located in the heart of downtown Chicago just south of the river and just off of Michigan Avenue, this gem of a hotel is an oasis in a city cluttered with high end sparkling high rise hotel. The staff was gracious and efficient. The room was ready even though I had checked in early on a Friday afternoon. The room was plenty big with a spacious bathroom and well appointed room. While the view outside my window was less than thrilling, the room more than made up for it. The afternoon wine reception did not disappoint. Fairly decent wine with a few snacks to keep you filled up until diner time. THe check out went just as smoothly and swiftly as the check in. GOod rates most of the time and within walking distance of most of Chicago's major attractions.",nan,nan,ta_s356
trip_advisor,"I stay in Kimpton properties almost exclusively for work, so I've seen a lot of them. The Monaco Chicago is definitely one of the best I've stayed in so far. As others have said, the hotel location is great, and the public/room decor is modern and hip but not overpoweringly so. My room was spotlessly clean, the wifi worked flawlessly, and there's an easily accessible business center that really helped me when I was in a pinch. What really set the Monaco apart for me, however, was the staff. From the doorman to the bell services staff to the front desk, everyone I encountered was genuinely warm and friendly. Business travel is often a lonely thing, but the Monaco staff made me feel truly welcome every time I entered the lobby.Although the attached restaurant - South Water Kitchen - really merits its own review, special props to Dan the bartender. Not only is he one of the most talented bartenders I've ever encountered, he's also one of the nicest. If I was a Chicago local, I'd go out of my way to sit at his bar.An all around great stay at the Monaco.",nan,nan,ta_s357
trip_advisor,"We stayed at the Hotel Monaco for four nights on a pleasure trip to Chicago. The hotel is really in a great location because it is within walking distance of many of the sites in Chicago. Even though it was freezing cold in Chicago, we were able to comfortably walk to many of the good shopping areas and to restaurants. We walked easily to Millennium Park and to the Art Institute. We also walked comfortably to the Architecture Foundation to participate in tours. The personnel at the front desk of the Monaco were quite helpful in giving us directions and also in helping us figure out routes for the public transportation system which is also easily accessible from the hotel. They were always pleasant and very accommodating. We asked to change rooms one day so that we could have a larger window and they willingly met our request.The deluxe river view rooms are a little small but the view from the window (particularly the rooms with larger windows) is quite nice particularly at night when the river area is lit up. The beds were comfortable and generally everything that we needed was available. We did not particularly care to go downstairs to get coffee in the morning and they did not hesitate to get us a coffee maker for our room. They also have a wine hour for guests each day which is a very nice treat. Overall it was a pleasure to stay here.",nan,nan,ta_s358
trip_advisor,This is the best hotel in downtown Chicago. It is beautiful and clean. The staff was so pleasant and helpful. The rooms were very clean and the beds were so comfortable. We stayed on the 5th floor 2 queen bedroom and had a view of the front street. The windows were large and had window seats. The bathroom was clean and had large mirrors and lighted makeup mirrors nice free products and fluffy towels--never had to ask for more towels here. Free wine at 5:00pm was a nice treat and to meet our friends in town. Doormen were so polite and always smiled and had something nice to say everytime we came and went. Very easy to get a cab. Good food within walking distance. The L is right around the corner.Perfect get-away A+++,nan,nan,ta_s359
trip_advisor,"We picked this hotel as it was a boutique hotel and were not disappointed. At every step of our stay we were greeting with smiling , helpful people. My sister and I arrived and we were meeting another sister who was to arrive several hours later. The front desk ensured that she was going to be on the same floor and in fact was in the hotel room next door.The staff booked us into restaurants, looked up information for us and it never felt like it was a chore.we found the location of the hotel great. Our room had a view of the Chicago River and we often sat in the window seat and looked out. It was so close to the theatres and we were able to walk to see our play. We were close to the hop on hop off bus and the local boat tour docks. Location Location Location. It was great.The rooms and hotel had an art deco decoration and we loved the complimentary happy hour.I would definately recommend staying here.",nan,nan,ta_s360
trip_advisor,"We had a river view room with a window seat. The room was decorated in well very funky. The window seat is actually the size of a twin mattress, that looks out over the city. Very different than the typical hotel room. The bathroom was on the small size with little room for toletries around the sink, but you are not in Chicago to hang in the bathroom. The black out curtins were super, it felt like midnight at 9am. Room was also pretty quiet, did not hear much noise from hall. yes the room is small but it is an older building. For two of us for one night it was fine. I would not try and fit a family. The room service was not so good we ordered breakfast and they got the order wrong, and the bagle was dry as dust. We did not use attched restaurant or join the nightly wine fest. The lobby is on the small size and I did not want to stand in a crowd for a glass of wine.",nan,nan,ta_s361
trip_advisor,"Everything about this place, with the exception of the price, reminded me of a DIY home remodeling project done on a shoe string budget. Everything looks good...on the surface. Take for example the river view rooms with their big calling card window seats. The bellman needed to push a super heavy divan out of the way in order to access the window seat which was about 48 inches from the ground. I'm tall with long legs so I was able to hop up. My traveling companion would have required a step stool. The upholstery on the window seat appeared to have been hot glued and stapled. DIY. At nearly $500 per night one expects a very nice bathroom, and yet in this case you get a small granite vanity top, one sink and a tub kit with a shower curtain.The lobby looks interesting, but again the pieces seem to be ""less than."" It looks good on the surface, but has a cheap feel. The evening wine event is nice, if far too crowded and understaffed.We were there on a Friday with a Saturday check out, so perhaps that is why the staff at the front desk was snippy and incredibly unpleasant, which is so different from what one usually finds in Chicago. They were unpleasant when we checked in and grumpy when we checked out. I have to say the people with whom I dealt on the phone while making the rez were incredibly pleasant and helpful. Perhaps they should be the public face of this hotel and the grouches behind the front desk could answer phones in a back room. Just a thought.We were assured that the $56 per night parking fee was the ""cheapest in the Loop."" The doormen and bellmen were cheerful, helpful and really really sweet.",nan,nan,ta_s362
trip_advisor,"I just stayed at the Hotel Monaco with my husband during the Chicago Marathon and had a wonderful experience. The rooms are big and have amazing pillows and linens. Try to get a room with a view because the window seats are my favorite feature of the hotel and they allow you to literally watch the amazing city of Chicago from the comfort of your room. The location is safe and close to parks, museums, and shopping. The staff's recommendations for dinner were great too and everyone was helpful and courteous. I would stay here again.",nan,nan,ta_s363
trip_advisor,"Chicago is one of our favorite cities and our stay at Hotel Monaco was very pleasant! The staff was very warm, friendly and quite informative. The hotel itself is very nicely put-together. The decor is colorful, fancy, and fun. We absolutely loved the room - the bed was very comfortable, all amenities were available, and everything was squeaky-clean. Our room was quite spacious (which is rare for any downtown hotel). Our maid would leave a lovely note on the bed for us each day after servicing our room. One of my favorite things about this hotel is that it had window seating with cushions! Location is also key as everything is within walking distance to many prime locations. The views are to die for as it is situated right on the river! When we come back we will most definitely stay here again!",nan,nan,ta_s364
trip_advisor,"This is not some large glitzy hotel- butIf you are looking for pleasant surroundings, good service and a good location- this is the place for you.Not too expensive, right by the chicago river and around the corner from the entrance to the Magnificent mile- you cannot go wrong with this small, quant and very excellent hotel.Even their restaurant is first rate-excellent drinks and the best flatbread aroundI really liked this place and highly recommend it......",nan,nan,ta_s365
trip_advisor,"For a first time trip to Chicago, this hotel could not have been more perfect. The location is awesome and so many things are within walking distance. We had a river view room and it was absolutely gorgeous. The window seat was one of the highlights of the room. You could sit and relax and enjoy the breathtaking view of the city. The room was incredibly clean and the bed was like sleeping on a cloud. Next time I go to Chicago I am definitely staying here again.",nan,nan,ta_s366
trip_advisor,"I had the opportunity to spend about 16 days in the Hotel Monaco in downtown Chicago. Its my favorite place to spend an extended visit in Chicago. The location is exceptional but its the Staff that keeps me coming back for more. The way I was welcomed each and every morning and afternoon made me feel like I was at home. A warm Good Morning Greeting early every day and a Big Smile and How are you on the return each afternoon. The room was very comfortable with a very nice bed and linen with a well thought out desk with plenty of power connections and good WiFi connection. But again, its the people that make the hotel so comfortable and in my eyes so successful. The front desk staff - Ericka, Foster, Dana and Kim are super professional and friendly; always willing to help with information and ensuring the guest are having a great stay. Peter and Jorge at the front door set the tone for the stay with big smiles and a Welcome as soon as you pull up to the front to check in and return every day. In the Southwater Kitchen, the servers like Paul make the meal enjoyable and offer great guidance for a change up to the daily breakfast routines.",nan,nan,ta_s367
trip_advisor,"I was in Chicago to attend a corporate event hosted at the Hotel Monaco. From the minute I walked in the door the staff was very accommodating, helping me find local eateries and get acclimated to the hotel. Few hotels understand what good customer service is. This hotel is different. The people who work there are concerned with guest satisfaction and it shows.",nan,nan,ta_s368
trip_advisor,"I always try to stay in a Kimpton Hotel when I travel because of their unique surroundings and attention to guest detail. This was my first stay at the Hotel Monaco and it lived up to my expectations. It sits in the perfect locaion for walking to the Michigan Ave Shops and Restaurants and also to the downtown stores and theaters. I took my daughter with me and she stated that it was one of the coolest hotels that she had ever stayed in. Every area of the hotel is very clean and decorated so nice. I asked when I checked in if I could could get a room with two beds and I was told ""no problem"". They upgraded me to a large room for no extra charge. The 5 o'clock complementary wine reception is such a lovely touch as was the morning coffee. They also stored our luggage for us until we left in the evening. I will definately stay at this hotel again.",nan,nan,ta_s369
trip_advisor,I stayed at the Monaco for one night (first time there or a Kimpton hotel in general) and was so impressed that I would recommend it to anyone in heartbeat and stay there again. I had a river view room which was awesome because it overlooked the river and Trump Tower was right in front. The nook in the window is such a neat and cute place to look at the view too. They even give you a pet fish if you ask for one. The room was super clean and trendy. South Water Kitchen is conveniently connected so you don't even have to step outside to walk to a restaurant for good food. 15-20 minute walk from Union Station and very close to State and Michigan shopping.,nan,nan,ta_s370
trip_advisor,"I was very excited to stay at the hotel after reading reviews. Sadly I was really disappointed with the room and hotel. The decor was modern but uncomfortable. The bathroom was in need of updating. The room service was yucky (ordered a grilled cheese that came on whole grain bread halfway cooked). If you are an avid traveler and have stayed at many modern hotels, this one falls short. I would not stay here again.",nan,nan,ta_s371
trip_advisor,"Hotel Monaco was phenomenal. This was our first stay at the Monaco and a Kimpton Hotel. We were very impressed!! The front desk staff was incredibly friendly and the doorman were probably the nicest I've ever encounted. When we were walking to our room from the elevator even the housekeeper greeted us with a big smile. The rooms were incredibly well done. Leopard print robes, very clean, beautifully decorated. Though our room didn't have a great view, the location of the hotel more then made up for it. You were walking distance to great restaurants and Michigan Avenue. We will definitely stay here again.",nan,nan,ta_s372
trip_advisor,"Central - near the river and within walking distance of major attractions. Unfortunately my first room was on level 5, looking out on an internal block, with very noisy machinery - air conditioners? - below. Also, the cleaner had not taken all the rubbish away so on request, I was moved to the 12th floor. Quiet, but not lucky enough to get a view. Room was a good size and amenity OK. Service courteous. Overall, a mixed experience.",nan,nan,ta_s373
trip_advisor,"Enjoyed the Monaco in Philly, so decided to try the Chicago version, and Wow, I wasn't disappointed at all. Three nights in a 9th floor river view room for a decent price, what else could one ask for. The staff is great, holding luggage for early arrives, calling when the room is ready, delivering wine to the room when we missed the wine hour, suggesting restaurants, friendly greetings... I was impressed. The location is perfect, a few steps from the River Walk and Metro. The room was surprising quiet and the bed and window couch were quite comfy. Although we didn't use them the hotel has several bikes for free uses by guests. Wifi was decent and the robes in the room are a nice touch. Needless to say, if I'm in Chicago again, I'll be staying at the Monaco!",nan,nan,ta_s374
trip_advisor,Loved our stay there last week for our anniversary! One of the best hotels I've stayed at. We booked the Mediterranean Suite and when we arrived we received a free upgrade to the Riverview one. We were on the top floor corner room overlooking the river. GORGEOUS VIEWS! Decor was great!! Favorite aspect was the window seats that had cushions and pillows. We would sit up there and take in the views. Location is perfect. Walking distance to Magnificent Mile and Millenium Park.,nan,nan,ta_s375
trip_advisor,"We checked-into the Hotel Monaco for a 3-night family ""mini-vacation"" with our 3 year-old and 5 month-old. Having researched the property extensively in advance, we reserved a Mediterranean Suite and received Room 905. The suite had a nice, partial view of the Chicago River, along with a city view of Wabash Ave. My older son absolutely loved the window seats and could have watched the El go by for hours if we let him! ;) We enjoyed the whimsical design of the Monaco's rooms. For having a ton of various patterns, it was fun, friendly, and a relaxed style. The suite itself provided ample room for us to setup a crib and cot (as well as a separate room to hang out in once the kids went to bed!). The only disappointment was the small bathroom setup. For a larger-sized suite, I have never experienced such a small shower stall or lack of counter-space. Certainly beneath my expectations for a property of this caliber. The staff at the Monaco were absolutely terrific. They were warm, welcoming, and terrific with our kids. We truly felt ""special"" and appreciated thanks to their efforts. If you're looking for a great location, a unique vibe, and a staff that welcomes (and frankly, dotes on!) families, definitely consider the Hotel Monaco Chicago. We're glad we did.",nan,nan,ta_s376
trip_advisor,"In Chicago with friends for the SGK 3Day, and wanted to get some sight-seeing in pre-walk. Since we had reservations for Sunday night after the event, I asked if the hotel would hold our bags on Thursday for a few hours before we had to head to the group hotel 22 miles away. No problem! Ryan, the concierge was extremely sweet and helpful. He made a lunch reservation for us, and invited us to have some complimentary wine when we returned. The bellman (so sorry I don't have his name) was helpful and sweet with directions to the train and off to Glenview. Peter, the doorman quickly hailed a cab and made sure we knew where we were going. On our return on Sunday night after the walk, we were thrilled to find glasses wine in our room compliments of Ryan again (he was now off-duty). The doorman remembered us and wished a warm welcome and asked how everything went. Rich at the front desk quickly made dinner reservations around the corner at Morton's even warning them that we were a little noisy and dressed like, well, like we had just walked 60 miles. The restaurant was equally inviting, provided a table immediately, and not worried about our appearance at all, even though they were quite full. By the time we left, we all felt like we were leaving friends. We were very well taken care of and the accommodations were lovely.",nan,nan,ta_s377
trip_advisor,"Just arrived home from our first stay in Chicago. Lovely room excellent decor, very comfortable king size bed and Egyptian sheets. Only slight problem was lack of hanging space in wardrobe, and no shower gel in bathroom. Little things in an otherwise great stay. The best thing is the location as it is 5 minute walk to the Wendale river and lake boat trips, and Michigan Avenue!I would definitely stay here again!",nan,nan,ta_s378
trip_advisor,"Stayed there for a girls weekend and it was fabulous! The room was beautiful, clean and large enough for 4 women to share! Loved the meditation bump outs and the decor of the room. I would definitely stay there again and the location was perfect. We took the train ($5) from the airport into town and the hotel was only a few blocks away. The train took maybe 45 minutes and since we arrived at 7:30 am that was a better choice then taking a taxi and sitting in traffic. The staff (night and day) were so friendly. We had many laughs with all of them!! Still laughing about ""Android"" ! ""The free wine hour was great...get there early the seats fill up fast :). Thanks for the fabulous stay, can't wait to visit again!",nan,nan,ta_s379
trip_advisor,"We arrived from O'Hare airport via the blue line cta train (cost $5 one way or put more on a card as we did for use over the three days we spent in Chicago) and a short walk from the 'Clark/Lake' station got us to this excellent hotel. We were so impressed with the decor as we walked in but the view we got of the river from our brilliantly thought out window seats meant we thought we'd been upgraded! This place is very central for all of the places we wanted to visit such as millenium park and the Willis Tower as well as certain restaurants we had researched and wanted to visit. The staff were so freindly and helpful, even posting some jeans to us that I had left in our room to New Orleans ensuring they got there before we left the USA. We missed the free wine tasting every night but only because we filled our days so full, we needed to spend much more time in Chicago than the time we had allocated. The reception staff were as good as any we've seen in almost 40 years of world travel as were the bar and restaurant staff.Free Starbucks coffee every morning in the lobby area was very welcome and was a really good start to the day. Even the quality of products in the bathroom was impressive (my wife knows these things). We didn't have a car until the day we left because we knew parking was difficult in Chicago and just used the cta train system even to go the whitesox game and visit the Chicago music exchange. The hotel was a great choice and probably the best of the five we stayed at on this trip, the trouble is when you start at an hotel as good as this the rest are always going to be compared unfavourably. My wife was the one who was insistant that we show our appreciation of a great stay here but I also felt it was the least we could do. We hope anyone reading this that visits this hotel gets the same experience we did. John and Karen",nan,nan,ta_s380
trip_advisor,"We loved the hotel Monaco. Upon arrival we were given a room with a city view - a fantastic raised window seat looking out over Chicago. The room itself was very nicely decorated with a sense of style and fun, and a really comfortable bed. The price was reasonable - although we booked many months ahead - and included a continental breakfast that was superb, a big plate of fruit and a choice of various toast/bagels/muffins etc. All the staff in the hotel were consistently polite and eager to be of assistance. We took full advantage of the free wine hour - everyday from 5 till 6 where you can get (several!) free glasses of wine. The hotel also has free wi-fi. However, perhaps most importantly for us, the location is superb, and allows for walking access to the city's main attractions from the Hancock Centre and Navy Pier in the North, through Millenium Park down to the museum campus to the South. All in all, a fantastic, well-run hotel with great facilities and a top-class location. Highly recommended.",nan,nan,ta_s381
trip_advisor,"A great hotel, in a wonderful location in Chicago. It's charming and fun but professional with great service and some really special touches.We were very pleased when we found the Monaco at a great rate through a third party site. But next time I'll book directly with Kimpton. Their AAA rate is comparable to what we found plus you get some really worthwhile extras through Kimpton. And probably no hiccups (we did have one). But the site introduced us to a hotel we hadn't looked at before and really loved, so that's good! We'd been considering several other hotels - actually had a reservation - but cancelled it when we found the Monaco. We'd never stayed at a Kimpton before, and honestly the decor didn't immediately appeal to me. However, it's high approval ratings and it's location and the fact that it was comparable in price to the other hotels we'd considered which didn't get nearly such good approval ratings, prompted us to book it. And the more we read, the more we got excited. I will be looking at Kimpton hotels first now. The location is absolutely perfect: a block west of Michigan Avenue and shopping, walkable for riverfront cafes or for boat rides, for drinks at the Trump Tower, the ""L"", Millennium Park and the Art Institute. They also loan bikes to ride along the lakeshore which, unfortunately, we didn't have time for. And now I love the decor. It's not bland! It was fun. Have I said that enough?Our first room was lovely but didn't have two beds (the hiccup - we needed another for our daughters) but they solved the problem that night and moved us for the next 3 nights. The new room overlooked the river and had the most wonderful views of Marina Towers and the Trump Tower from the deep window seats which couldn't have been more perfect for my daughters. They both sat and read and worked on their laptops in the windows. It also had a walk in shower which for me was perfect as I'd recently had knee surgery and climbing into a bathtub to take a shower had been surprisingly difficult. Thank you Frances, it was a great help.Thought I'd miss the in-room coffeemaker - though you can ask for one - but it turns out that the coffee in the lobby was delicious (Starbucks?) and I so enjoyed going down and getting the coffee and the NYT and having an hour to myself, working on my laptop at a special counter in the lobby, that I didn't want the coffeemaker making a noise in the room, waking everyone else up.We were visiting Chicago, my husband's home town, for a wedding and my hair curling tongs broke as I was getting ready. Room service delivered an emergency set of tongs within 10 minutes. One of the staff also found my camera in the lobby one evening and had it ready at reception for me the next morning when I checked if it had been handed in. All of us enjoyed the happy wine hour which was lively and buzzing on the first and only day (of the 4 we stayed) that we were able to make it. We were to move rooms the day of the wedding and the staff arranged for all our things to be moved to the new room after we'd left. It was thrilling to come in at night and see the lights of Marina Towers and the Trump Tower opposite. And I haven't mentioned the animal print robes! Such fun. As well as the decor. We had a blast. We don't ever remember enjoying a hotel stay more. (We went on to an awful hotel in Pittsburgh for the next weekend which made the Monaco seem especially wonderful!)Not sure if it was the concierge or if he was one of the front desk attendants who went above and beyond for us too, on his day off! He arranged tickets for 10 of my husband's family to go on the architectural boat tour. (My husband asked him about it very late one night and so the concierge called on our behalf the next day - his day off!) It was a spectacular day for the tour. And cheaper than if we'd arranged it ourselves.This hotel was a very wonderful treat. And yet it was as reasonable as the other hotels we'd considered. We'll definitely go back. We had a lot of fun and loved our stay here.",nan,nan,ta_s382
trip_advisor,"First off i will say the hotel itself was very nice, clean and centrally located. Now for the bad. I booked my trip to the hotel monaco for a small group so we needed 2 rooms. Upon check in the hotel did not have 2 rooms available. The desk clerk promptly got the manager since she could only find one room. The manager then said not to worry he would find us a room. About a minute later we were handed keys to the second room, to our surprise upon opening the door to the room we found the lights off and people sleeping in the room!! I went downstairs to speak with the manager who claimed that these people must be there illegally and that it would take hours to get them out. They then sent us to the Club Quarters around the corner for the night. The hotel said i would not be charged for the night since they didn't have a room for us. I am still waiting to receive credit for that!! We were able to check in the following morning and the stay from there on was great. The hotel staff was very appoligetic regarding the incident the evening before but it just didn't start the trip out well.",nan,nan,ta_s383
trip_advisor,"I've stayed in Kimpton's in Chicago before and always liked them so thought I would try Hotel Monaco this time. The room was spacious & they include a yoga mat in every room! You can even call down to the desk to get a yoga block & strap. On TV, they have free yoga & Pilates classes. What a great way to get an early workout in without leaving the room. I also went to the gym one day. It's surprising large. I ran on the treadmill. I was initially bummed since I forgot my headphones but they provided headphones as well as icy cold water. The staff was very friendly & I was even able to get early check in. I will definitely look to stay here on my next trip (and I get to Chicago pretty often for work!)",nan,nan,ta_s384
trip_advisor,"This was our second stay at Hotel Monaco and it didn't disappoint. The staff continues to excel in customer service. They always acknowledge their guests and are attentive to any needs. The housekeeping is immaculate. The lobby was remodeled since our visit in 2012 and additional seating was added, which is nice for their evening wi e hour. I suggest the river view rooms...I love sitting in the window seat watching the city below or reading. I will not hesitate to stay again and definitely recommend Kimpton Hotels.",nan,nan,ta_s385
trip_advisor,"A friend of mine and I stayed in a double room on the 8th floor for four nights. Our room overlooked Wabash and was quiet and pretty large. The beds were very comfortable, and the bathroom was roomy and well-maintained. We made use of the in-room refrigerator and safe. The wi-fi was excellent compared with other hotels. We were in town during an oppresive heat wave, but our room stayed comfortable.The location was fine, with easy access to mass transit. We were able to walk to the Art Institute and even the John Hancock Center.The concierge gave us a good recommendation on a local steakhouse, and the entire staff was knowledgeable and courteous during our entire stay. We also enjoyed the hotel's complimentary happy hour/live music a couple of late afternoons.One of the two hotel elevators didn't seem to be working one of the days during our visit, but that was just a minor inconvenience.Overall, we had an excellent stay at the Monaco.",nan,nan,ta_s386
trip_advisor,"We found the Kimpton chain last year in Cambridge, Mass. and fell in love. Love the boutiquey feel of the living room (Lobby) and the rooms are super clean and extremely comfy beds. The robes and Aveeda products are a nice touch as well. Do NOT hesitate staying here.....free hotel bikes to cruise the neighborhood and the staff is friendly and anxious to help....cocktail hr. and the ability to bring your dog (we did not) and there is NO scent of doggie anywhere. Shower pressure on 4th floor is weak!!!",nan,nan,ta_s387
trip_advisor,"First of all, the service at this hotel is exceptional. I travel often for work and fairly often for leisure. The staff at this hotel is in my Top 3 experiences. Each and every single staff member we interacted with was helpful and so courteous. I'd truly choose to stay here again based on the service! The location of the hotel is excellent. Within walking distance to many things. We even walked to the Gold Coast and Old Town from the hotel. We were on the 12th floor and the noise of the city was muted considerably. The room was well appointed. Beds and linens comfortable. The robes provided were lush. Towels were soft and still absorbent. The window ledge sitting areas were our favorite part of the room. We used it each afternoon for people and river watching. If sheets would have been provided to put over the cushion, I think my 16 yo would have chosen to sleep there instead of the bed! We did not hear any noise from the adjoining room, even though we know guests were in the room. Hallway noise was minimal also. Room carpeting was clean, along with the bathroom.On Thursday night, the wine reception from 5-6 pm, included live guitar and flute, along with their wonderful wines and Sangria. Friday night, no live music, but still enjoyable with their watermelon Sangria.If returning to Chicago, I would not hesitate to stay at this hotel.",nan,nan,ta_s388
trip_advisor,"This is a small hotel next to the Chicago River. Just a couple blocks from the Architecture river boat tours. Walking distance to many restaurants. Walking distance, but a long walk, to Navy Pier. Walking distance to Art Museum and park. Good service, and we had two comfortable queen beds. The free wireless internet service from our room blocked access to our home security system so that was unfortunate. Nice small lobby for relaxing, reading the free newspapers, if your family members are not yet awake. Free coffee/tea there, and spouse enjoyed evening wine party. Had no trouble catching cabs there. Our room did not face street so probably a bit quieter but had ugly view of backs of other buildings. Primary complaint was hearing noise of elevated train nearby but hard to get really quiet room in big city. No refrigerator unfortunately in room. Across the street from a 7 Eleven which was convenient for snacks and supplies.",nan,nan,ta_s389
trip_advisor,"The staff at the Hotel Monaco Chicago are great! We like to stay at Kimpton Hotels and the staff at this location were above all the others. With two small children the staff put forth extra effort to make them happy and didn't make us feel like the plague victims that should be hidden from the regular guests. The room was typical of a Kimpton, plush but not extravagant, and the location is perfect. A few blocks from the L, river, and Michigan Ave we could easily get to the major attractions by walking, public transit, or water taxi. The attached South Water Restaurant is good and has an equal staff, with decent, if pricey, food and a good selection of local brew on draft. We enjoyed the stay and will certainly stay here again for our next Chicago visit.",nan,nan,ta_s390
trip_advisor,"Stayed one night here on business - experienced the usual top-notch sincere service that Kimptons provide. Check-in was a breeze, for some reason (no idea why) they upgraded me to a 2-room suite, which was really fabulous...the windows in the rooms have these platforms in them with pillows and mattresses - sort of little daybeds, unique and fun.Had beers and appetizers in the downstairs bar - great stuff - duck jerkey, mushroom flatbread, olive plate.I'll be back here on vacation!",nan,nan,ta_s391
trip_advisor,"The Hotel Monaco is a wonderful small hotel perfectly situated. The staff was tremendous during our last stay of 4 nights and the concierge (Rich or Rick) was great. Close to everything, No complaints at all. Nightly free wine hour (with good wine) and free internet in your room. Not a lot of space for kids to run around so I probably would not stay there is I had more than one kid - the lobby is small as would be expected in this type of hotel. I did not see many young kids around. Will definitely stay there again.",nan,nan,ta_s392
trip_advisor,"Pros - In downtown, Riverview rooms. All tourist points at walkable distance. Sky deck, John Hancock observatory, buckingham fountain, Navy Pier..shopping. Service is excellent. got room on higher flr and river view..rooms were very clean and best. Staff were very good.Free wine hour in evening, though I did not got time to go at that time. received excellent service.Cons - Parking - valet parking - $52 overnight which is quite expensive. Rooms are comparatively small. No swimming pool",nan,nan,ta_s393
trip_advisor,"Stayed here for a couple of nights for business and it was a good experience. Hotel looks a little beat from the outside (the sign is kind of old and no mention of Kimpton!) but once you get inside it feels like a Kimpton hotel. Quick check in and pleasant staff. Room was on the tenth floor and was spacious enough. The best thing about the room was the view - it looked right out on to the river and some of the beautiful buildings in Chicago. Some of my colleagues had no view so you should definitely ask... it was stunning at night. The window was HUGE and had a seat in it that I could lie out on, really lovely.Bathroom was stocked with aveda products (nice touch) and was pretty standard. The bed was a dream to sleep in and I wish I could bring one home!For people staying for longer trips... I think that there was a fridge but you might want to check. There wasn't any drinks station but I did not need that on this trip. The location was excellent for any touring of the city, you are within walking distance of pretty much everything. Ate at the hotel restaraunt for breakfast and it was good... all a la carte, not buffet (although they serve free coffee in the lobby in the mornings). I ate the pancakes and they were good. Definitely recommend for a couples trip/business trip to Chicago.",nan,nan,ta_s394
trip_advisor,"The bright colors and eclectic furniture in the lobby are always a welcome site upon checkin. Both check-in and check-out went smoothly. As a Kimpton Intouch Member, I always appreciate the $10 mini bar credit, because you never know when you'll want a snack (the Rusty's potato chips are my favorite). For this one-night visit, I was in a King Deluxe room, not one with a river view. Room 1417 was nicely laid out with the bathroom separated from the sleeping area by a short, wide hall. Internet worked well. TV was a little odd, in that I could not locate the local weather channel or news, so it was just easier to pull up information online. The bed was very comfortable, and the air conditioning worked great. Minor wear and tear was visible, such as on the wooden soap dish and a small area where the carpet was coming unraveled by one of the walls. These were very minor wear and tear items, and I do plan to stay here again. The hotel is well located for shopping on Michigan Avenue (a short walk away) and visiting tourist attractions such as Millennium Park. To get to the hotel from O'Hare, take the Blue Line to the Clark/Lake stop. The hotel is a short walk away (about 3 blocks).",nan,nan,ta_s395
trip_advisor,"The Hotel Monaco in Chicago was very nice - great location downtown in the theater district with friendly staff. The room was clean, and a nice size. The room has a nice big window seat that overlooked the street which was unique. The bed was very comfortable. I appreciate the yoga mats in the Klimpton Hotels, and along with a yoga menu item on the television, it is easy to relax. I also appreciated that there was a lighted magnifying mirror in the bathroom. There are no coffee makers in the rooms, however a coffee and tea bar is provided in the morning with Starbucks and various teas. In addition there is a wine bar in the lobby in the evenings, and many people were enjoying the wine. The hotel also has bikes that may be borrowed for riding to the parks, etc. There is a restaurant on site which I did not try, however, if I go back I will be sure to eat there - the menu looked quite good. Overall, I would recommend this hotel in downtown Chicago and hope to be back.",nan,nan,ta_s396
trip_advisor,"I spent a warm summer afternoon and night here. The location was terrific, right next to the Chicago Tribune building. The food festival was going on around the corner, and in the morning it was just a couple of blocks before I was running along the waterfront, through Grant and Millennium parks and up to the planetarium.

We loved the location -- easy walking distance to many great restaurants, cafes, and attractions. We will definitely return!",nan,nan,ta_s398
trip_advisor,"Booked thru hotels.com during a busy weekend in Chicago, so paid 359 p/n for Monaco, a nice 4-star boutique hotel (in some cities this would be a 3 or 3.5; in Paris, it's a 3.) nevertheless, nice property, beautiful, brand-new rooms, nice amenities, room was fully- stocked and prepared, and the staff was top-notch. Bed was good, but not as comfortable as the Drake two nights earlier. Stayed in Palomar Dallas (another kimpton boutique) a month ago - same bed. Meh...My one qualm, which I am disappointed about: kimpton's unique value proposition is ""we will have everything you need (such as hair dryer, contact solution, cell phone charger, curling iron, hair spray, nail clippers, you name or) OR we'll get it for you"".During my recent Dallas stay, we called down inquiring for a micro-USB charger or charger cable (for an android phone or blackberry) most common charger in world). We're told at 1am that they don't have one, and can't get one, but we could walk across the highway to the drug store and probably buy one. They alsoDidn't provide toiletries in room, or a 2nd robe (see my other review).During this trip to hotel Monaco Chicago, called down at 1am for some contact solution. Was told they ""just ran out, sorry"". I further inquired about the ""if we don't have it, we'll go get it"" policy, and was told ""sorry but you can go across the street to 7-Eleven ad get some."" I asked twice more ""but what about the ""we'll get it for you policy"", to which the response twice more was the same. Finally, she said ""do you want us to get it for you?"" Ummm, Yes! That was the point. In fairness, Maybe I have just had poor luck and generally the hotels will call the promised ""extras"" and/or get them. But thus far, my experience is kimpton being 0/2. In all fairness and completeness, the property is very nice, extremely clean and brand-new, and tremendous location in the heart of Chicago. Recommended A-.",nan,nan,ta_s399

Bernard the concierge was exceptional in helping us with car service. The only issue we had was we booked through Booking.com way in advance and when we checked in they gave us a handicapped room. We called down to the front desk and spoke with Michael and told him we did not want a handicapped room and he told us he didn't know which rooms were and were not that way. We found that hard to believe. We were moved to another room but it was also fitted for a person with needs. The bellman told us all the rooms that ended in a particular number were fitted that way. Not sure why we were given a room that someone with needs might need, was it because we used a discounter? We travel a lot and have never encounter this one before. Not sure if we will use this hotel chain again. Never had this issue at any of the other high end hotels.",nan,nan,ta_s402

They changed every two or three days and were all stunning. We loved the ceiling to floor windows. As we were on the last stop of our honeymoon, arriving back from Aruba en route for Canada, we stayed three nights here. The beds were incredibly comfortable. Bathrooms very contemporary. There was chocolate covered strawberries and a large bottle of Evian Water along with a congratulatory note waiting for us in the room when we checked in. We had breakfast downstairs in the restaurant and the food was lovely. Great location, close to metro, shopping and walking to some sights. Very good restaurants close by. Service was impeccable.

Free wifi is always a bonus too.I reserved the room on hotels.com but was not satisfied with extra charges that they charged me. When I called the hotel they said they charged extra $125 or $175 for incidental charges per night and will be refunded after a few days. I've never heard that before! I would have given them 4 stars but the fact that they did not notify me about these charges when I checked in kind of annoyed me.",nan,nan,ta_s412

We were celebrating a milestone birthday and I had noted it as such in my reservation comments. Upon return from dinner our first night there was a bottle of still water, dessert and a note with birthday wishes. A very nice touch. Our room was well apointed, the beds luxurious.

trip_advisor,"Stayed at the Sofitel Chicago Water Tower the weekend of Oct 31, 2014. I am in Chicago several times a year and like to try different hotels. The Sofitel was extremely nice. Check-in was quick and easy. The Sofitel representative at check-in was very nice, personally greeting me. A nice touch was that she walked around the counter to personally hand me my room key and talk about the hotel. The bellman led me to the room, never turning his back to me, and pointing out various features of the hotel. The room was spacious by Chicago standards and very clean. Outstanding bathroom, large with a tub and a separate marble/glass shower. Bed was ok, comfortable, but my side seemed to sag.The bar is very nice. The waitress was exceptional, and remembered our names the second time we went in there. Drinks were expertly crafted. Nice atmosphere for enjoying the company you are with and for people watching along Wabash / Rush street.Ate breakfast at the restaurant one morning. Was not overly impressed. Standard breakfast fare and prices expected for an upscale hotel. Service seemed disorganized and spotty. They offer a free French pastry and coffee.Only complaint is with the valet prices. $65.00 per night, which is on the very high end for Chicago hotels. If you are familiar with the area, you can find self-parking a few blocks away for $40.00 per night. Basic WiFi is free which is a plus.Bottom line - nice upscale hotel close to major restaurants, bars, and shopping. I would definitely recommend. The price was on par with other hotels in the area. The personal touch at check-in, room cleanliness, and the bathroom set this apart from the other hotels.",nan,nan,ta_s423

Although the Sofitel is very nice, I still prefer the Waldorf.The Sofitel architecture and decor are stylish and modern. My suite was very well-maintained, the food in the restaurant was quite good, and the bar area was lively. The bed had a feather mattress topper and was very comfortable. Service throughout the hotel was excellent.Shortcomings of the hotel were minor. My suite was a little small, at least by American standards. Closet space was very small. The bathroom was nicely done in marble, but was also on the small side and had only one sink. The thermostats in each of the two rooms were not placed in the best locations to make the temperature comfortable.I prefer the junior suite at the Waldorf rather than this full suite at the Sofitel because the Waldorf room is about the same size but lower-cost, feels a little more luxurious, has a fireplace, and has a larger bathroom with two sinks and a great, oversized soaking tub.",nan,nan,ta_s424

The Sofitel is a great property in an outstanding location, but the Conrad is similarly (if not lower) priced and actually has a more luxurious feel, with newer amenities and larger rooms. I must caution anyone staying here - the beds are HORRIBLE. One thing that does help is the service. The service at most Sofitels, including the one is Chicago is excellent. Restaurant and bar here are very good as well. I would say if you can't afford the Park Hyatt or Penninsula, and the Conrad is sold out, this is your next best bet!",nan,nan,ta_s426

The French pedigree of this chain is in evidence from the smart, stylish decor in the room and the common areas (including a breakfast room full of natural light and great waiters - our favourite was Andrey from Ukraine), and the pastries that were the best I've had outside of Paris.

(Warning: it is a mere two blocks from the American Girl store). Navy Pier is a fairly easy walk, as is Oak Street beach. The hotel's public spaces are beautiful--it's great to stay in a place that has a polished, adult-friendly feel that also takes such good care of kids. Our corner room on the 20th floor gave us a fantastic view, and having two sets of doors between the bedroom and the living area allowed my husband and I to kick back in peace, and let the girls giggle into the night. The bed was incredibly comfortable--it envelopes you in down splendor that will make it hard to leave it in the morning. Even the girls' sofa sleeper was more comfy than their own beds at home, with a feather bed and down duvet. The Hermes bath amenities were some of the best we've come across.The staff welcomed us warmly and did a fine job of taking care of our room and needs throughout the stay.

The glass clad building is something of a landmark with its unusual triangular tapering design. Internally this means that the floors have an intimacy that other large hotels do not.

Really? I was not ready to pay $300 for staying another day for the their fault. And now the negotiation started - first pay 50% and the pay 25% of that day's tariff...really??? Is that what's expected from a world class hotel? I felt like I was speaking to someone in a shady motel and negotiating for a deal...and upon mentioning that I will be sharing this my experience online....I was advised by her that threatening her won't help. Is sharing your experience online with others the same thing as threatening someone? Based on this experience, I decided to pay more and stay elsewhere than stay at this hotel for the third. At checkout, I was asked by the gentleman there whether i needed any help. And, upon narrating my sour experience to him, all I heard was an apology after each line of my narration.I would never ever stay nor recommend anyone to stay at this hotel in unless you want to experience customer service equivalent to cheap 3rd class service expected from a cheap budget hotel/ motel, and hear only apologies for their mistakes and no proper action is taken for their mistakes.",nan,nan,ta_s452

Staff was friendly and helpful, and the turndown service left Swiss chocolates on the pillow.Comfortable bed and pillows, Gym was large and well supplied. Meeting rooms were large and quiet. Food was a let down as the. Edge tables were all overlooked, but the other items were cooked better, and even the oatmeal,for breakfast was well made.Would enjoy staying here again.",nan,nan,ta_s453
trip_advisor,"We have discovered Chicago after a long trip across America. We booked at Sofitel without knowing where it was in town. Finally it was a good choice as it is very central, 2 mn walk to Michigan avenue, and easy to get on the right road to the airport on final day. Sofitel is Sofitel = quality.End of July may not be the best period to get a good deal but it was worth paying for quality and location. Public Parking next door at 45$/ day. Bed was too soft for me but my wife enjoyed it so...Staff at the counter was nice and very helpful.",nan,nan,ta_s454
trip_advisor,"Stayed for a weekend in March. The location is top notch, bars and restaurants all nearby as well as the Magnificent Mile. The hotel is very unique, stylish and holds its own in the architectural wonder of Chicago and competing hotels. Check in was smooth and staff were very friendly, professional and helpful. The room was excellent...very stylish, all the amenities and very comfy bed. We chose a ""high floor"" room and had a stunning view of the Chicago skyline and Hancock Tower. We ate breakfast at the hotel restaurant one morning...if you can, treat yourself to that. Fresh complimentary pastries were offered at the start of our meal and the breakfast we ordered was superb, with attentive service. A great experience overall, it was a treat in all respects!",nan,nan,ta_s455
trip_advisor,"Sofitel is a French chain and it never forgets that! The lobby, the flowers, the food, the amenities, the room decor - all the best of today's Paris! We experienced an unfortunate hiccup with our reservation but the front desk staff was quick to remedy it with an amazing upgrade. The location is excellent - just a couple of blocks off Michigan (the Magnificent Mile) and the Hancock Tower - but even more importantly, just a couple of blocks from Oak Street where the miracles really happen: Prada, Louboutin, Hermes, Saint Laurent, Chanel, Jimmy Choo .... I have to say we only ate breakfast at the hotel but the menu was varied and the food more than enough to see you through to a late lunch.Trust Peter, the concierge - he is a genius with a terrific sense of humour! He more than made up for a couple of the front desk staff who could have have used a bit more training in the hotel systems and policies.In all, a very good stay!",nan,nan,ta_s456
trip_advisor,"This was the fourth time that I have stayed here, and it has become my ""go to"" Chicago Hotel. It is not located in the heart of the downtown commercial district, but it is close enough, and a short taxi ride. The hotel is amazingly good value, with everything clean, and new and well buffed. The rooms are a good size and extremely well appointed and well maintained. I had forgotten my toothbrush, and room service had a complimentary one sent up to the room within 5 minutes. The whole staff are there to serve, and try hard. I enjoy the ""bonjour"" and ""bon soir"" stuff with which all the staff greet the guests. Sure, it could be a bit hokey I suppose, but I travel so much, and enjoy a hotel with its own identity. There is a Starbucks just around the corner, if you, like me, prefer to spend $7 on breakfast, and not fork out for a hotel breakfast. The only downside is that the gym is tiny, and very short on strength training equipment and space to use it.

Personally, Personally, I found it expensive but then our currency is poor versus the Dollar exchange rate. Service was excellent especially in the restaurant and the help we received with getting 3 very heavy suitcases to our room was really appreciated. It seemed to be very busy with large numbers of conference delegates as Chicago was hosting two large events during the week of our stay, 19 to 23 May. Overall a very satisfactory experience.",nan,nan,ta_s463
trip_advisor,"I have stayed at this hotel several times now and keep returning when I visit Chicago. The location is great as it's so close to Old Town, one of my favorite areas. There is great shopping (walking distance) and are great restaurants (walking and driving) nearby. The service in every department is excellent. Honestly though, the food at Sofitel is great so if you are very busy and don't have time to plan dinners that's OK. My husband and I really like their Sunday brunch. Service in the bar is great too, and room service is quick. My room has always been spotlessly clean. The bed, pillows, and bedding are all very comfortable and there are always plenty of towels. The front desk is quick and efficient.",nan,nan,ta_s464
trip_advisor,"My first stay was in June 2012. I was impressed with everything. Normally, I would look for a restaurant outside a hotel, but I arrived late and decided to try the hotel's restaurant. I'm glad I did as my dinner was first rate. I told our hotel administrator that we should start using the Sofitel for meeting and we have. My colleagues and the executives at our meetings really like the hotel as well. Nothing is cookie cutter here as the rooms are nicely laid out. There is a definite French accent floating around the entire hotel, creating a nice atmosphere. The location is convenient and in a very desirable part of town. Finally, the staff has always been helpful. I have been back several times since my first visit and I look forward to returning.",nan,nan,ta_s465

Once in the lobby, I am pleasantly greeted by the personnel at the registration desk where I am quickly and professionally registered. Since I frequent this wonderful hotel, I am greeted like an old friend returning to visit which is wonderful when traveling for business. Makes for an extremely nice welcome! The rooms are beautiful, clean, bright and very well appointed. The restaurant is perfect for breakfast, lunch and they have a wonderful gourmet dinner menu. The bar has some great choices of wine (as well as many other beverages) and the small plates they serve in the bar/lounge area are all delicious. I LOVE this place!",nan,nan,ta_s466
trip_advisor,"I stayed at the Sofitel for 5 nights to attend a conference. It is very well located near Michigan Avenue with all its excellent shopping, and close to very good restaurants and has easy access to public transport. It is in a quite street. The building is very attractive modern architecture and has a bright large lobby. Checkin was rapid with very pleasant efficient staff. My room was on the 26th floor with great views of the city. There are plenty of elevators so it was never a problem to wait for an elevator. The room was large and very well furnished. There is excellent storage for clothes and a large safe which swallows laptops and other valuables. The bathroom is also large and supplied with all you could need - and has a separate shower cubicle which is great. The desk is large and there is a thoughtful socket adaptor for European and UK plugs. The bed is extremely comfortable with a variety of pillows to choose from. The curtains provide excellent blackout. Anyone should be able to sleep very well here! My only niggles were that there is no coffee provision in the room (extremely unusual for US hotels) which is something you really miss if flying in from a long way away and the queues for breakfast were often rather slow. Despite these minor caveats, this is a really good hotel and well worth using if you are in Chicago",nan,nan,ta_s467

trip_advisor,"I booked a one-night stay at the Mile North earlier this year to take advantage of the prime location. First impressions were very good, I really liked the way the lobby is set up. The Starbucks to the left of the front desk is a great touch! When I made the reservation, I was only able to reserve a room with two beds. When I came to check-in, the amazing front desk staff noticed that it was just me staying with them and they upgraded me to a very nice suite! I thought that was awesome, and quite honestly; I did not expect that. I am not picky and would have been happy with a regular room, but it was really nice to know that the staff pays such close attention to things like that. I wish I remembered their names, but the man and woman at the front desk (as well as the rest of the front office & hotel staff, I'm sure) should be recognized for their extraordinary care to detail and kindness during my stay.The suite in which I stayed was clean and very comfortable. I wish I could have spent more time in it during my stay. I would definitely stay with this property again and look forward to a time in which I can return.",nan,nan,ta_s469

We have stayed here a couple of times and have found the staff very helpful, the rooms clean, and the beds comfortable. My only criticisms are that on both visits, we had a room that had stairs between the bed and the bathroom, a nighttime concern and the fact that the rooms have had only a single chair. Although the rooms are smallish, they certainly could accommodate two places for quests to sit and visit.The breakfast is Spartan but adequate and there are many dining establishments close by.",nan,nan,ta_s471
trip_advisor,"I chose Mile north, cause it's got great reviews, it turned out to be a let down.Staff at the front desk who weren't professional, they were too green to tell me if certain services were free or not.I've been to other large cities and stayed at their hotels, this hotel really doesn't live up to my expectation, as a 4 stars hotel which is located in the center of Chicago, it's hard to believe that they don't have a scale for travelers to weigh their luggages. One of the employee kept telling people who checked in to go to the bar in the hotel, well there was a flyer and a sign which mentioned it closed on weekend, I heard a guy asked the staff about it, he said' I wasn't aware it didn't open on weekend.'Tripadvisor indicated that it had shuttle bus, it wasn't true, they could arrange it for me, which means I have to pay.I intended to check in earlier, thankfully I looked it up before going there, they charge for early check in. I asked if I could check out a bit later the next day, they told me that they would charge me automatically! There's a surcharge for WIFI on my room, course I didn't turn mine on. I thought I didn't give them any reason to charge me any additional fee, ironically I needed to pay like 7 bucks for service fee, I really don't get what kind of services they provided me, really.They apparently use every single excuse to ask for money.I highly recommend people NOT to book Mile north, it's overpriced with lousy services, period!",nan,nan,ta_s472
trip_advisor,"Just got back from Chicago and had stayed in 3 different hotels along the way. Mile North was the last one on our trip,Pros- I loved the feel of the hotel, The young man checking us in was very polite and nice along with all the bell men who were very help full and friendly. We had 2 rooms both on the same floor 22 and both had great views. The rooms were very spacious and I loved that as you walked in you had to step down into the bedroom. The beds were super comfy and lovely linens.The Cons- We had travelled a lot on this trip and we were looking forward to ""laying in"" on our day of check out. Well it started very early in the morning with the maid knocking and shouting house keeping every 5 minutes, I am not sure what time it was but I am sure it was before 9am after she tried to open the door twice I thought she would have got the message that we were still in the room. I went down to get a drink and when I came back the maid was in one of the rooms cleaning, I started talking to the guest in that room who was sitting on the bed and the maid basically ""shooed"" us out the room. We went across to the other room and I tried to explain to her that I was under the understanding that check out was 11am and it was still only 10am well that did not matter. She started to wheel the vacum into the 2nd room!!!!! So I told her to please wait so at least we could get out the room. When we gave up and left the room I came down to the front desk to re confirm check out time and to explain what happened I was merely told ""well I should have put the do not disturb sign on the door"" As I explained there was not one in the room or I would have done that from the night before. An apology would have been nice but I got the impression the woman behind the desk really did not care one bit. Maybe Mile North should advise their cleaning staff that on the day people are checking out to be mind full what time check out is and make sure ""do not disturb"" signs are in all their rooms.Having said that I really liked this hotel a lot the location was Perfect, the room very comfortable and the cafe downstairs was great to get a hot breakfast egg, sausage and bacon for $7 was just what we needed to re group after being pushed out the room LOL. Will definitely be returning to Chicago and I would stay here again for sure.",nan,nan,ta_s473
trip_advisor,"My husband and I overall enjoyed our stay. We asked for a view of the city, but were told we would enjoy the size of our room even more.Our room was large. We figured out after some inspection that it was the ADA compliant room. That's fine, still wish we had had a better view.It was immaculate. The bed was super comfortable.The location of the hotel is perfect, we spent a lot of time strolling up and down Michigan Avenue and it was an easy walk to our various destinations throughout our trip.The lobby decor is very cute. We spent some time just hanging out down there reading and enjoying a beverage.After prepaying online and being told at check-in that we needed to provide a credit card only for incidentals, we were dismayed to be stuck with hotel service fees of $20. We paid it, but whaaaaat? Like I said before, we really enjoyed our stay. Just a couple of things...",nan,nan,ta_s474
trip_advisor,"The location and lobby were promising and 1 of the females working at the desk when we arrived was at least friendly while ""Jessica"" twirled her hair and ignored the fact that her co-worker (Cynthia) was struggling with a computer issue. We were traveling with our dog so we were given a ""pet friendly"" room with the nastiest faded & smelly carpet! UGH! But the gross carpet was NOTHING compared with the unprofessional, rude and disrespectful treatment my husband received on a phone interaction with Jessica over the huge price difference in added charges for a pet the hotel charged at check-in as opposed to the price advertised on a pet-friendly hotel finder site. The issue was eventually resolved the next day by a Manager but it ruined our evening and left us with a very negative impression of this hotel.

trip_advisor,"I booked this hotel on a ""bait and switch"" deal that Hotwire offered in it's ""Secret Hot Rate Hotel"" category. After listing four guests for our reservation, Hotwire shows six quality name brand four star hotels then in small print mentions you could also get an independent or boutique hotel. I put two adults and two children in the drop down tabs to make sure we received a room big enough to accomodate my family. After finding out my secret hotel was ""MileNorth,"" I panic and look up reviews for this hotel since I've never heard of it. (I have stayed in Chicago over a dozen times and literally have never seen this hotel.) There were so many issues reviewed that I tried to get my hotel changed to a major chain, since Hotwire declined I decided to take a chance and see for myselft. Upon arrival a very pleasant door man gave me directions on where to park. Milenorth uses a self park lot across the street that is shared with Northwestern Hospital. (24 hours of parking was $53.) We entered the hotel lobby which was clean and very trendy looking. We check in and find out that HOTWIRE guarantees a double occupancy only for the secret hot rate. (Check their website and you won't see any mention of this). Not to worry, Christopher at the desk gladly helps us out and gives us a junior suite on the 8th floor for our trouble. When we get up to our room we are pleasantly surprised that it's nice and clean and has lots of space for our family. The bathroom was clean but dated and there was a slight issue with the lock on our door, which my teenage son was able to take care of. The bed was a lovely soft cloud with a fluffy down comforter that was truely a treat after walking Michigan Avenue all day! The sofa bed was standard and the teenagers were just fine on it. Our T.V. didn't work in our room so the kids used the free wi-fi. When we mentioned to the desk about the T.V. upon check out, they promptly gave us free drink coupons to use that morning.

No motor lobby so loading/unloading is a bit of a strain. Particularly so for us with two dogs. We stay at a lot of Kimpton hotels as they all accept pets. The pet fee of $75 per dog is a bit salty at this one though. This was a short stay so did not have the opportunity to take in the amenities of the hotel.

The MileNorth itself is a neat boutique-feel hotel. It offered probably one of the most comfy hotel beds I've ever slept in - with nice plump pillows and a great duvet. I loved the ""green"" option of putting a card on the door stating you didn't require maid service the next day and receiving a $5 credit to use at the on-site small restaurant. The staff was accommodating and friendly. A very pleasant surprise was the wifi that was available free of charge. The only disappointing part was that the bar and restaurant at the top of the building was undergoing renovation and wouldn't be open until the beginning of April. But there were plenty of alternatives available in the neighbourhood including a small lounge area in the lobby that had an awesome flamenco guitarist playing one night.

Yet breakfasts were not included.While both check-in and check-out were a bit messy for us, we still give it a 5-star rating thanks to the attitude of a waitress in a roof-bar, who offered a free drink in return for the one I spilled from the table.

But four star hotels are supposed to do more. These are all fairly minor, but they add up. First, the reception clerk was supposed to give me a packet relating to the meeting I was attending the next day. I didn't learn that until I arrived at the meeting and was without it. Apparently other attendees experienced the same thing. Second the bathroom had a dripping faucet, the toilet bowl had hairs on it, the shower curtain rod was partially dislodged such that one couldn't close the curtain all the way, and some of the towels were so old that they were fraying on the edges. Third, the main floor lamp in the room didn't work and the cable box behind the TV had an annoying red blinking light that I had to cover with a towel. Fourth, I ordered a Manhattan at the bar, and the bartender poured a bourbon on the rocks. When I reminded him I wanted a Manhattan, he topped off the glass with a few drops of vermouth, added bitters and a cherry, and handed it back to me! Unreal. Fifth, the WiFi was terrible: I'd say I was only able to connect around 20% of the time.",nan,nan,ta_s497
trip_advisor,"This hotel is nicely located close to the Magnificent Mile, but still offers you a peaceful sleep. You have a convenient bar at the lobby, a friendly welcome upon check-in. My reason to stay at the MileNorth was to attend a course at the excellent Kellogg School of Management. In fact, I stayed at this hotel three times. I could choose others nearby, but there was really nothing to make me go elsewhere. Spotless. Beautiful, pleasant rooms.",nan,nan,ta_s498
trip_advisor,"My family and I stayed here as my youngest daughter had some testing to do at Lurie Children's and the stay was great. Not only are they located next to the hospital, but this was my daughter's first stay at a hotel. The concierge, Christopher, was very pleasant and even gave us an upgrade for the night being that it was our first time there and we were VIP members. Our room was very clean and the beds were comfy. We will definitely be returning to this location not only because of the service but also the price can't be beat, especially being soo close to the Mag mile. 2 Thumbs up for sure!",nan,nan,ta_s499
trip_advisor,"Loved our stay at the MileNorth. We pricelined the room, so it was the luck of the draw, but we were thrilled. Perfect location near the Miracle Mile. The room was sort of oddly laid out, long and narrow like a bowling alley, but beautifully furnished. The bathroom was painted a gorgeous metallic copper. Room had a great view and was quiet. We loved chatting with the bartender at the rooftop bar, ate at Gino's next door. Everyone we talked with was so friendly, which was something we didn't know about Chicago being first time (southern) visitors. Would definitely return to the MileNorth and to Chicago.",nan,nan,ta_s500
trip_advisor,"Stayed at the MileNorth for 3 nights over New Years. I agree with the many TA reviews that the location is perfect. So close to the magnificent mile and all it has to offer. The rooftop bar was also a treat. The rooms are spacious and having the fridge for leftovers is convenient. It was a little disappointing the front desk staff didn't put us in the room I reserved, but things were sorted out quickly. The bathroom is large and my wife really enjoyed the lighting from the lit up mirror while putting on make-up. The shower water pressure is a bit lacking. We had a room on a higher floor and didn't hear a peep the entire time we stayed.The lobby is very warm and welcoming with big comfy couches and chairs. Overall we enjoyed our stay, but I probably would try out a different property when I'm in Chicago next.",nan,nan,ta_s501
trip_advisor,This place lived up to my high expectations. The service in all regards was friendly and efficient. The decor is pretty modern but not over the top. The rooms were clean and comfy but most of all quiet! The little restaurant downstairs had the best salad I've had in a while and their flatbread was great! Maybe a little pricey but we weren't even planning on eating so it was a nice surprise. The room rates were very competitive and I booked directly with the hotel! Also... Right next to Gino's so we loved that!,nan,nan,ta_s502
trip_advisor,"I stayed in a King Suite for 3 nights because my apartment was being painted, and I didn't want to spend a fortune for a hotel. I was quite happy with my stay. It was such a joy to stay in a very spacious room. The desk area was separate from the living area which was separate from the area where the bed was. I get claustrophobic in hotel rooms quite often and this room was very comfortable and spacious. The staff was very friendly, including housekeeping and doorman. The location can't be beat! One block East of Michigan Avenue and all the great shopping and restaurants and bus routes just steps away! For the price and location, the Mile North Hotel offers a great value. There are nicer hotels for a romantic getaway or for a vacation, but if you are there on business, shopping trip, in Chicago visiting family, this place is great. Free W-Fi and had no problems getting on. The only complaints I had were: the bed could be more comfortable (I found it a little too hard). Also, on the ceiling outside my bathroom, the paint was peeling. It's not a large ceiling area so to re-paint wouldn't be an arduous task. It would be a lot more appealing to fix it. I would stay here again if needed.",nan,nan,ta_s503
trip_advisor,"I stayed here a number of times when it was the Affinia, and have now stayed about 3 times after the transition to MileNorth. I'm not sure I'll go back. The room was fine, the front desk staff were fine, and the place in general is lively and inviting. I do miss the restaurant that was there when it was the Affinia. That place was beautiful, and I was always happy with the food. It think the appeal of the property has diminished by its absence. But there were a couple of things that really bugged me this time in the form of policy. My wife and I arrived at the desk around noon, and wanted to check in. I know we were early. We were told that for $29 we could check in early. No way that's gonna happen. I don't understand why a room isn't just given to a customer if it's available. In my opinion, letting me have the room because it's ready, and I'm there, is zero. So charge me zero. It seems to me that for no cost to MileNorth, they could have made me happy, and this review would be a lot different. Keep in mind the front desk staff never said the room wasn't available. And on to the next thing.... An up-front charge of $65 was made to my card for incidentals. That haven't been consumed. That one is tough to fathom, but I don't purchase incidental items, so I don't get it. My wife did the check in, and was blindsided by the charge explanation from the front desk. I wasn't there, and definitely would have fought back. At check-out, the charge was gone, but by that time, the PR damage had been done. Because of these 2 policies, I personally felt punished, either because others have taken advantage of the hotel in some way, or MileNorth has figured out a way to make a few more dollars. I don't think hotels should be rewarded for these kinds of policies. I'm upset by this experience, and don't like saying bad things about businesses. I love the hotel, and it's location, but I thought the PR loss associated with these policies is significant. There are too many lodging options in Chicago.",nan,nan,ta_s504
trip_advisor,"I was surprised at how quiet this hotel was. The windows are covered in an extra pane of glass which serves to reduce the noise to near zero. As well, during the 4 nights I stayed here, I only heard other guests in the hallway a couple of times, and never any noise from adjoining rooms. Sure, there was the occasional muted siren from ambulances arriving at the neighbouring hospital, but these were not disturbing in any way.The room was a good size and the bed positively huge. Furnishings were of a high standard and there was the nice touch of the reclining armchair next to the window with the street view. Ask for a room facing the front of the hotel for the better views - the ones in the back overlook the backs of other buildings.Our room was on the 5th floor, which meant it was serviced by 2 elevators which were dedicated to the 1st - 7th floors. This was fortuitous for us, since the remaining 8th - 29th floors were serviced by 2 other elevators, one of which was out of commission for our entire stay. As a result there were very long lines and excessive waits for those residing in the upper floors. I would have rated this hotel as ""very good"" instead of ""excellent"" if I had been impacted directly by this issue.We did travel up to the 29th floor to have a light meal in the roof lounge. Since it was winter, only the very small indoor section was open, but we were lucky enough to get a table and enjoyed the views over the city. Food was good and there was a good selection of drinks.Location is perfect, an easy walk to shopping, restaurants and even down to Grant Park and the Art Institute. We really recommend visiting the Dreihaus Museum. We've been to Chicago 3 times and only just discovered it this time. Beautiful place and exception Tiffany exhibit on while we were there.Staff were friendly and efficient. The room was in good shape, with some minor wear and tear in the bathroom (peeling wallpaper, some minor water damage). Overall a very nice place for a reasonable price.",nan,nan,ta_s505
trip_advisor,"Mile North was so warm and cozy I would return. Check in was quick and easy. I stayed by myself so the room was the perfect size for me. There was enough room for me to work on my lap top, listen to my ipod and then watch television. The bathroom was very cute too. I love Chicago and this area is close to everything. In particular, it is a short walk to the train, my favorite pizza place and my favorite wine bar. Not to mention the roof top bar. The drinks were pricey, but it was a nice place to hang out with friends.",nan,nan,ta_s506
trip_advisor,"amenities perfect, small bar, trained staff, simple style,, all tasteful ,big lovely well appointed pleasant utterly clean cheerful room...,, ill be back, location is terrif, exercise room a happy surprise, nice people, cute helpful engineer Scott fixed something i broke in 5 minutes, front desk great ,,esp Christine found me Volare, my new fav ..location is nothing less than perfect and prices were so moderate!!!",nan,nan,ta_s508
trip_advisor,"I was booking relatively last minute and have stayed at numerous properties within the city. I would not hesitate to return here. As many have mentioned, the location is ideal, steps from Michigan Avenue and Northwestern University medical campus. There are numerous cafes, coffee houses, a Walgreens, and of course a great mix of high end and moderate stores and shops. About 6 blocks away, you will find a Trader Joe's, which is a great place to pick up some grocery items plus wine and beer.The staff was courteous, pleasant and aimed to please. Even though I had an early arrival into the city, they easily accommodated me and I was in my room by 11:30 am. For a double, it was spacious, well laid out and had comfortable bedding and an ample sized bathroom with a great shower. (no tub, didn't care). Only complaint was the water pressure. For such a nice shower, I really wanted to linger, but spent most of the time just trying to wash the soap off of me and the shampoo/conditioner out of my hair. I did appreciate that they had built in pumps for shampoo, conditioner, and body wash. At most hotels, of course, these products come in sample sized tubes, but I liked the fact that they were taking a greener approach. The windows were double paned, which was a must here as emergency vehicles came and went at all hours of the day and night. I had a very peaceful night's sleep. I did not have a chance to try the rooftop lounge nor the bakery/cafe in the small lobby. Both seemed inviting and popular. If you are a deep dish lover, you will be delighted to find a Gino's East literally next door. Being a Lou Malnati's fan myself, I did not indulge in one of their decadent pies. If you are looking for a small, clean, comfortable and reasonable hotel, this one certainly fits the bill.",nan,nan,ta_s510
trip_advisor,"I've stayed in Chicago several times and the rooms have been ok but small. Our room here was amazing. SO spacious and long. I was amazed. For the price I paid I couldn't believe our luck. Hotel is centrally situated and very modern and nice. Our room was on the 4th floor. We had a huge kingsize bed that was super comfy, a seating area with another tv (had 2 in the room which was even more surprising). Good size closet with an iron & ironing board and safe in it. Nice coffee maker and fridge. The bathroom was superb. Large shower with nice powerful jet (walk in - room for 2!) nice soft fluffy towels and really liked the products left in there. Nice to have shampoo, shower gel & conditioner provided to you. Our room was north facing and was very quiet, didn't hear any outside noise. Room was spotless.What I liked even more was the fact that they offered a ""go green"" scheme which meant if you chose to opt out of having a maid come clean your room that you would receive a voucher worth $5 to use in the cafe/bar area located in the lobby. We did this as for 2 days we didn't care if the maid came in or not. This helped towards our yummy breakfast we enjoyed in cafe area. Lots of variety to choose from and all fresh. We also enjoyed a couple of glasses of wine, once again lots of variety. I would stay there again and highly recommend this hotel. It was definitely an enjoyable stay. Oh and the view from our window was pretty cool...looked out and saw the Hancock Tower - that was pretty amazing!",nan,nan,ta_s511
trip_advisor,"I stayed here on a one-night business trip. Arrived late, and I was upgraded to a queen suite on the 26th floor. Overall my impression was of a midwestern version of a Euro style boutique hotel. The suite was attactrive, roomy and comfortable. The lobby offered bar fare in the evening and Starbuck's coffee and food in the morning. The rooftop bar was not for me, not liking heights. The view from my room was directly at the Sears tower. Shopping nearby was great. I am recommending this to my friends who travel to Chicago.",nan,nan,ta_s512
trip_advisor,"Our group reserved 7 rooms at this hotel. The location was excellent and the rooms were very nice. My corner room was on a high floor and very quiet. The bed was comfortable although the duvet type covers were too hot for comfortable sleeping. There seemed to be a major disconnect with some of the personnel. We were told that we could use a room by one receptionist and the next day were told that we couldn't use that room nor any other for our group. My most disappointing experience was with the hotel taxi stand. At 4:45pm I asked the attendant if he could get two vans @6pm to transport our group of 15 to Bucktown. He said that I needed to talk to the receptionist about it and that he couldn't do it. The receptionist said that she would talk with him. When we got to the taxi stand @6 there was one cab. Another one came later. Finally he directed our final group of 5 to a van. We asked what the cost would be to Bucktown and were told $30 but were charged $40 when we arrived. No meter. Three cabs to the same address paid $17, $28 and $40. Something didn't feel right about that and left a bad impression.",nan,nan,ta_s513
trip_advisor,"This hotel has the BEST the location. The rooms are amazing!! A sitting area, desk area,and bedroom are all separate. We had a room on floor 23. It was Clean and great views. The walls were a little thin at night and the pillows were very ""hard!"" I usually bring my own but forgot. We loved having a fridge in the room too. The staff was exceptional From check in to check out!! The bar in the lobby was nice and welcoming. We loved Emily! She took excellent care of us and had some fun conversation. The Starbucks was much enjoyed each morning while sitting on the patio. Can not wait to go back again!!",nan,nan,ta_s514
trip_advisor,"I've book a room for a conference in Chicago, strangely I had to book three reservation for three different night, after my stay I found that I was charge not the price that I booked but the double. I try several time to contact the manager and the finance, after couple of day they let me know that the change was made and rembourse me, in fact they did nothing. And I'm not able to reach anybody",nan,nan,ta_s515
trip_advisor,"This hotel is very nice. Clean, modern rooms. There's a rooftop bar, but we didn't visit it so I can't comment on it. I loved having the coffee shop in the lobby, which serves Starbucks! The location right off Michigan Ave was perfect! My only complaints...valet parking for 2 nights was over $100! The only mirror in our room was the small one above the sink in the bathroom. It was very difficult for my husband and I to get ready at the same time. And lastly, try getting a room on a lower floor. We were on the 28th floor and we waited a long time for the elevators.",nan,nan,ta_s516
trip_advisor,"Really enjoyed staying at the Mile North Hotel. Great location, which we were close to walk to all our favorite restaurants and shopping on Michigan Ave. The room was very nice and roomy. The bed was very comfortable and the linens and towels were quality. The coffee shop in the lobby was so convenient for a morning cappuccino. The staff at the front desk were absolutely wonderful, always a smile, hello and welcome. We will definitely return here for our next visit to the Windy City. I forgot to mention the awesome rooftop bar. Great outdoor couches and settings with awesome views. Brecken the bartender was delightful, he was so friendly and made our evening very special.",nan,nan,ta_s517
trip_advisor,I love this place. If I visit Chicago I will choose this hotel. It's. A great location downtown and is walking distance to a lot of things and a short distance to the red line. The staff was some of the best I have experienced they were more than courteous and very accommodating. Their recommendations were really good and they were able to provide good directions to other places. They do have free wifi and it was pretty good. The beds were a bit hard but not unusable like others had mentioned. We didn't rent a car so we did not pay the $$ for the parking. However on the downside they do charge to have a microwave a few of 20$ per day yikes. My infant son likes warm formula and so he had room temperature. But overall it was perfect. I am very appreciative of the quality of serv that was provided.,nan,nan,ta_s518
trip_advisor,"We stayed at this hotel in August 2014 whilst traveling the USA, the hotel has a nice fresh entrance lobby and a small coffee/alcoholic bar set within it. Our room was a nice size and felt clean, the bed was comfy also. The location was great for what we wanted, right on the Magnificent Mile (well just a 10 second walk anyway!). There are restaurants nearby however we did have a 10-15 minute walk one night to find a restaurant we fancied, that is just us though! The only negative comments we had were that when we checked in the check in staff put a numbered tag on our luggage and left our suitcases on a roller in the middle of the lobby, we asked if we could take them to our room ourselves but were told that we were not allowed (Insurance purposes maybe?), we had many valuables in there and felt reluctant to leave our goods, we hung by the lift for around 5-10 minutes waiting for the bell boy but he never appeared, we took it upon ourselves to remove our cases from the roller and take them all up ourselves, as we were travelling we had 4 suitcases and 2 shoulder bags, this was an inconvenience as when you pay for service you do expect slightly more, it was just too greater risk leaving our bags unattended by an open front door for anyone to steal. The other comment is that our bedroom floor by the A/C unit was soaking wet, presumably from the unit itself, we did not bother to complain as we were only there for a few nights but surely the bedroom maids would have noticed when cleaning? Anyway, not a bad hotel but stayed in a lot better for the money. Really nice rooftop bar in the evenings for cocktails!",nan,nan,ta_s519
trip_advisor,"You pay for the location, which is great. It's half a block off of Michigan Ave. Feature wise, nothing to write home about. Fuzzy TV signal, and constantly running toilet, which started to overflow our last morning there. Bathrooms could use some updating. Chipped tiles and the tub wasn't the cleanest. No complaints about elevators, and we were on one of the higher floors. Our view was into an office building so we could see people working. You WILL get charged a $9 per day fee at check out, no way of avoiding that. Of course, they don't mention it until you are checking out. I'm not sure I would stay there again based on what we had to pay for the hotel.",nan,nan,ta_s520
trip_advisor,"Good location in relation to the Magnificent Mile. Chic lobby. Room was pretty basic - but I did like how there were two levels (bed/tv/nightstand on one level, couple steps up was the bathroom, closet, bar/refrigerator area). The chipped painting in the bathroom was a turn off. We stayed on the 25th floor, and I didn't find the wait time for the elevator to be too long, like some others had mentioned. I requested a high floor for a good view, however, our view was simply into an office building. PS. there is no baby changing station in the hotel lobby's bathroom. Frustrating since I needed one ASAP when we arrived and couldn't wait for the check-in process.",nan,nan,ta_s521
trip_advisor,"I visit Chicago every year for work stay in a different hotel every time as an attempt to see more of the city. This time I stayed at the Mile North hotel with my son and mother who watched him while I worked. It was a great location not a far walk from the Magnificent Mile and everyone was so friendly. My Mom walked my son everywhere and the staff at Mile North were so helpful, kind and friendly. My son is 13 months and very active the staff helped her with the stroller and gave her directions and guidance on how to get around the city. Not to mention it was very clean the rooms were spacious and beautiful and the grab and go restaurant was very handy. Our room was near the elevator so I was originally concerned about noise but it really was very quiet.",nan,nan,ta_s522
trip_advisor,"We arrived at the hotel today having been on the road for 17 hours and just as we arrived, disaster struck. The cab driver pulled the trunk lever, it shot open and crashed back down on my head gashing the skin on my skull with lots of blood evident. This is when the front desk team really came into their own, providing antiseptic, gauze, cream and sticking plaster plus an ice pack to take down the swelling.They reported the cab driver for not recording the incident and in our disarray, having left things at the desk, they called up to the room to bring things to us.They left three messages on our phone updating us on their actions with the cab firm and enquiring as to my health. How good did I feel, despite the lump and obvious plaster on my head ?As for the hotel, it's perfectly positioned just off the mile, all top notch shops a few yards away and the lake front just a couple of short blocks.The room is very well proportioned with two double beds, a lovely clean bathroom, safe, hair dryer and large flat screen TV with a great choice of channels.WiFi is free and efficient and there is a Starbucks in the foyer.You will love this place- and the people that work here.",nan,nan,ta_s523
trip_advisor,"My wife and I actually live in Chicago, but we recently stayed at MileNorth for a brief getaway and a nice night out. MileNorth was the perfect choice. The hotel is in a fantastic location, immediately near all the great restaurants and shopping Michigan Avenue is known for. However, we actually ended up spending most of our time at the hotel's rooftop bar. It has great views of the city accompanied by a very cool atmosphere. The drinks and food were delicious, and all at a reasonable price.As far as the room, it was a very good size compared to the average Chicago hotel room. And it has a great new, updated style and feel. But best of all, it was very clean and fresh.Finally, we were very impressed with the hotel staff. They were extremely professional and courteous. They offer a cool type of concierge service called UrbanBuddy which is great to find things to do and places to see around the city. Ultimately, they went above and beyond to ensure we had a pleasant stay. Even the bar tender at the main lobby bar, was engaging and thoughtful. He noticed we were carrying a bottle of wine with us to our room and gave us two wine glasses and offered to open the bottle for us!",nan,nan,ta_s524
trip_advisor,"Our first time in Chicago and the photos of the hotel were what drew us in. We were not let down. We arrived late in the night, but check in was simple and the room was immaculate. The king bed was very comfortable, a separate lounge area and a small business desk which wasn't needed for us but a nice touch. The bathroom was a little on the smaller side and the only negative to report here was the water pressure in the shower was very bad, so after a long say out site seeing, to come back for a lousy shower was disappointing. Location wise we could not fault it. Very close to the amazing lake, navy pier, John Hancock observatory and close to magnificent mile. The rooftop bar had an amazing view but was very cold the night we had beers there, convenient to shops and transport (buses and subway). We had heard of the Ginos east pizza which is next door, it was ok. Overall a great hotel and would surely stay again",nan,nan,ta_s525
trip_advisor,"We live in the city and were looking for a little stay-cation, mile north gave us great views of the Hancock building and gave is the feeling we were in a different place in our own city.Right away we had a friendly valet open our doors to lead us into this unique lobby. We were greeted by friendly knowledgable staff, who directed us to their roof top bar! Talk about an urban oasis! We had great weather so this was an ideal place to relax with a glass of wine. Our room had a clean modern feel to it, random but the lighting in the bathroom was amazing for doing make up. The internet TV was not great, we thought about ordering a movie but was $16.99, which seemed high especially because the tv wasn't great.We wanted to see what was around and even being locals we were a bit out of touch with the area, the hotel directed us towards the 'Urban buddy' app which instantly hooked us up with spots we had never heard of before. We had a great stay, I would stay here again, and recommend it for any family or friends who come to town.",nan,nan,ta_s526
trip_advisor,"Just returned from a weeks stay at this lovely hotel. The rooms are spacious, well decorated and very comfortable. The reception is well decorated and the in house Starbucks coffee shop was very handy after a long days shopping. The location is amazing, just off Michigan mile.....good to drop off all your purchases and continue shopping without being laden down...lol. The staff were pleasant and helpful at all times and the rooftop bar was a great place to relax and 'chill' after a day seeing the mant many great sights of Chicago.Definately recommend.",nan,nan,ta_s527
trip_advisor,"This was our first visit to the MN, and we really loved our very modern & clean room. We often like to visit the North Michigan street area for summer evening fun. The MN easily ranks as good, if not better than the other boutique hotels we have visited in the area for this purpose. Using the 'net, I was able to score 1/2 price parking just around the corner from the hotel. SUPER!!To cap off our visit, the fantastic Labor Day 2014 weather made the rooftop lounge a perfect place to unwind after our evening dinner. The MN will be the FIRST place I try to book the next time we visit Chicago.",nan,nan,ta_s528
trip_advisor,"My husband and I recently stayed here for a business trip. The hotel is in a good location for proximity to the Magnificent Mile. We were on the 27th floor, right next to the elevator. There was some elevator noise in our room, but nothing unbearable. It was nice to have the separate seating area, and my husband really appreciated the reclining chair. We also visited the rooftop bar, which is nice. The front desk staff was very friendly, and the doorman always greeted us with a smile. Price seemed a bit high. The included wifi was a nice bonus. I'm not sure if our view was a ""city view"" but because we were on the 27th floor, we did have a nice view of the surrounding buildings. There is a Gino's East pizza restaurant right next door, which I had never heard of, but is apparently famous, as there was always a long line waiting to get in.",nan,nan,ta_s529
trip_advisor,"Overall a very nice, trendy hotel. Bistro in the lobby, rooftop bar/lounge, and nicely sized rooms with modern and ""chicago"" decor. Two complaints: 1) the elevator service was extremely slow and small. Even if an elevator did happen to make it to your floor, it was unlikely that you could squeeze your way into one since only 6 people could fit not to mention luggage etc. 2) The Rooftop bar often has events on the weekends (weddings, etc) so you may be (rudely) greeted by a young lady telling you that it is closed and to come back in 3 hours. Great...now you have to wait for the elevator again....Honestly - it was a good location, good room, and interesting lobby. No major hospitality provided and I would say great for the do-it-yourself traveler. Elevators would be difficult to fix - I understand - but maybe more signage regarding events for the rooftop bar opening/closings.",nan,nan,ta_s530
trip_advisor,"MileNorth seeks to be an uber hip boutique hotel, from the lobby to the rooms but i've had better experiences in budget hotels. Located a block off Michigan Ave., other than Gino's East Pizza and the side door to Nieman Marcus, there is nothing else around. The lobby, decorated with modern couches and chairs, is dominated by Starbucks and a bar and feels cold. The front desk is little more than a 6-foot wide stand near the elevators looking to be constructed of old valises. The hotel has a restaurant, but there is no place for breakfast within blocks. We purchased some items in Walgreen around the corner and stored them in the mini-fridge. Our rooms had the bathroom, decorated in bright orange foil, 3 steps above the sleeping area. Not a great idea for nighttime pitstops. Our 17th floor MileNorth double room didn't have much of a view, but not a big deal, but the mattress seemed way to short. I am not tall, but my feet were off the bottom edge. Weekend housing keeping was a joke. We spent most of our Saturday out sightseeing. Housekeeping showed up a 5 pm while we were showering and dressing for a wedding. The housekeeper never returned. Our room went unmade, dirty coffee cups and towels littered the room and trash baskets overflowed. Family members in another room requested housekeeping to clean up some broken glass received no response. We complained upon checking out, but received nothing but sorries for our troubles.",nan,nan,ta_s531
trip_advisor,"The staff was GREAT, thanks Dora (at front desk) hooked me up with a suite. It was beautiful. Loved the room, Urban buddy is a GREAT app and everyone should download and get this app when visiting any city. It provides you with real locals who know their city, and can tell you the best hole-in-the-wall spots to check out, just like a text!",nan,nan,ta_s532
trip_advisor,"This hotel is behind Northwestern Hopsital and used to be accomodation for staff. It has been done up well but you can still detect an institutional feel in the corridors and from the old heating/colling and plumbing system.Check in was quick and service was okay--a bit perfunctory. I had many packages delivered and the bellman promised to deliver them after helping me with my bags. However, after an hour I had to go and find him. He said he had been busy. I stood in the reception area to make sure I got my packages. One went missing but the duty receptionist found it after a few hours. The next day I had laundry which was again not delivered to my room on arrival. I had to go to reception to get it from the bellman. I had a very early morning flight and so wanted to settle my bill the night before. Unfortunately, the room night charge is only posted after midnight. I had paid in advance for a guaranteed rate and so the system was showing I had a credit but the staff kept reading this as money I owed. It took nearly 20 minutes to sort this out. That being said, the night receptionists are very friendly and efficient. One gave me a wake up call and had the bellman come to my room to pick up my luggage (unasked) 5 minutes before the time I had ordered a cab for. Truly first rate service.Room size is spacious and decor modern with large flat screen TV. You get free high speed Internet. There is a 24 hour small gym which has all you need, including free weights, weight machines, treadmills and jogging machines.There is a tiny Starbucks outlet in the lobby to have breakfast at--you are better off going across the street to St. Claire's and eating with all the hospital workers. Bottomline: I got value for money and would stay here again, but service could be improved by the concierge team in particular and all reception staff should know how to check out a guest who has paid in advance. The hotel is also justifiably popular so it can get very crowded in the lobby and waiting for an elevator. As other guests have noted, the room doors also slam shut and can wake you up.",nan,nan,ta_s533
trip_advisor,"Lovely modern comfortable hotel in an excellent location. 2mins walk for the mag mile with abundance of shops. Not many places to eat/drink directly around but walk a bit and youll find them.Large ""Suite Like"" room with all the extras, only downfall was the AC - noisy and cold and windows couldnt be opened. Staff are lovely and the terrace bar worth a visit. As was the lobby bar for food and drinks.Would run back!",nan,nan,ta_s534
trip_advisor,"My husband and I stayed at this hotel last weekend and had a fabulous time. Hotel check-in and checkout was efficient, and staff at the desk were friendly and provided us with great dinner and site seeing recommendations. It is walking distance for great shopping and dining options. The room was spacious and clean and the roof top patio provides a fantastic view of the city. The staff at the roof top patio were friendly and the drink and dining menu was impressive. Being pregnant the bar tender was kind enough to create a fun non-alcoholic beverage. I would stay here again. Chicago is a great city!",nan,nan,ta_s535
trip_advisor,"We stopped in Chicago on the way home from Ohio and booked this hotel the day before. It's downtown in Chicago and is fairly new so thought $200 was very reasonable pricing. Checking In was fine and the bellman was very friendly and helpful. We had a suite with a queen bed but my sister and I didn't want to share so I used the pull out sofa. It was like a foam block.we called room service for an extra blanket for me because all that's offered is a sheet and another thin blanket, they said it'd be 20 minutes but it never showed up. Our room was in a corner and the staff only cleaning room was right beside us. When the cleaning ladies showed up in the morning they were VERY loud. They constantly slammed the door and were laughing and talking loudly outside our door which woke us up. You'd just get back to sleep and it'd start all over again. The rooms definitely need more insulting to block out hallway noise. I had also stood at the Starbucks counter for at least five minutes without being acknowledged. There was two guys working and they'd look at me and then continue doing something other then helping me so I finally left. The hotel is nice and renovated and on a fairly quiet side street but overall I'd hoped for something better.",nan,nan,ta_s536
trip_advisor,"This is my second stay here within a 6 month period and I was very satisfied after the first 2 night stay so I re-booked and was excited to stay 3 nights this time. Well my excitement was quickly brought to a halt when my daughter opened the sofa bed up to discover that it was badly broken and hanging on the floor to the point of where she couldn't sleep on it. As if that wasn't enough, the mattress was so soiled with spots and stains that it had a smell. They ended up bringing us a roll away bed and eventually moved us to another smaller room the next afternoon. After requesting on 2 separate occasions to speak with a member of management my request was never granted and it never happened. I'm so disappointed with MileNorth since I put them in a different category than other chain hotels... I guess they are just the average hotel in a good area with average to poor service. Not a good look MileNorth...SMH",nan,nan,ta_s537
trip_advisor,"Stayed for three nights due to our son's orientation at Northwestern Chicago campus. Hotel was convienent to the school, dining, shopping and bus stops. The staff was friendly and helpful with directions to places we wanted to go. Our room was on the 24th floor and was very quiet. We choose to skip housekeeping during our stay which meant no one but us came and went from our room. We would stay there again.",nan,nan,ta_s538
trip_advisor,"Stayed here for 3 nights with my wife last weekend. This hotel is located just off Michican Avenue, near to the Water Tower with loads of shopping around the corner. We asked for, and received a room above the 15th floor, to reduce street noise. The only downside was that we didn't have a great view, we could see the John Hancock between the buildings though. The room itself was a decent size, good facilities, powerful shower with a very handy fridge for fruit and snacks (there's a good Trader Joe's in the vicinity). Downstairs the foyer has a cool, modern layout with a coffee shop on one side. Of course, we had to sample the Chicago deep-pan pizza next door in Gino's East, a local favorite. Overall, no complaints at all really (wifi is extra however) and we got our 3 nights at a good rate.",nan,nan,ta_s539
trip_advisor,"Upon arrival, we were greeted warmly by Cynthia at the front desk. We were given the wrong room on accident but they upgraded us to a suite immediately after they found out which was appreciated very much. Our A/C coil froze as well which caused our room to become very warm but there was someone there to fix it within 30 minutes of telling them about it. The shower curtain absorbed some of the water and leaked it onto the floor once or twice. We really enjoyed that you are given $5 each day you choose to forgo a full room cleaning. We also appreciated the mini-fridge because many hotels don't supply those anymore. The suite provided a secured lock box (although we didn't use it) and plenty of storage. A con was the television. The television is a high definition set on a expensive wall mount and it has, what seems to be, below standard definition cable access. We didn't watch much but some of the channels reminded me of the days of rabbit ears. This was the case in both rooms so I'm pretty sure it wasn't a room specific issue. Throughout our stay, we needed new towels and an extra pillow. With the towels, they said they would be up in a bit and they never showed up so we called the next morning and they eventually came while we were out all day. With the pillow, we called at around 9 o'clock and we again didn't get it that night but eventually the next day while we were out. The hotel has two elevators for floors 7-29, which isn't quite enough. We were only there for four days and it wasn't extremely busy yet on several occasions, we waited longer than ideal. I know this isn't something that can just be changed instantly, I just wanted to let readers aware. There is a fantastic coffee shop in the lobby as well. Overall, we really love the hotel and it's location but the somewhat shady service and rough television/shower curtain situations kept it from receiving a 5/5 rating. We would recommend the hotel and plan on returning!",nan,nan,ta_s540
trip_advisor,"Milenorth is a great hotel and I love the new renovations! The designer really did a great job. As an architect with an extensive design background working in Barcelona and New York, I appreciate when a hotel pays attention to detail. The new mobile concierge service they offer is awesome, too! Powered by Chicago based startup, UrbanBuddy, I was connected to a local expert in under 2 minutes! Very cool. UrbanBuddy helped me with anything I needed from where to eat, how to get around and what to do! Thanks!",nan,nan,ta_s541
trip_advisor,"We stayed at The Milenorth the weekend of May 31st. When we checked in I asked if they could bring us up two champagne glasses (we were there to celebrate our first wedding anniversary). After 45 minutes of not recieving the glasses I called and again asked that they send us up two glasses; we finally recieved those 30 minutes later. The hotel was in a great location, right off Michicgan Ave by Watertower. We walked ever where, while Millenium Park, Grant Park & Navy Pier aren't close about a 30 min walk everywhere you go will be a walk. The hotel was very nice on the inside, the little cafe and all the seating was nice. We only used it to get something to drink Sunday morning. Our room was just fine, nothing outstanding big bed with chair and smal table. The room did not have much lighting and there we no light switches, you had to turn them on at the lamp. We did have view of the the Hancock building. The best part about the room was the bathoom, it was very large and had a huge walk in shower. The shampoo, conditioner, and body wash were attached to the shower wall, but they were full size bottles and you didn't have to worry about using all of it before your spouse had a shower.The worst problem I had was when we checked out and found out there was a $4.95 hotel service fee. I called the front desk to find out what this charge was since I hadn't been told about it during check in. I was told that this was a Hotel Service fee that is added to all bills. The women at the front desk said I could find it on my confirmation reciept. I wlooked and was still unable to find it, I was then told that this fee went to the Children's hospital next door. This didn't sound right to me and I explained that to the guest services person. At that point she said it's only $4.95 and I'll refund it for you. While I agree with the women $4.95 is not a lot of money I still don't think it's good to sneak in those extra charges.",nan,nan,ta_s542
trip_advisor,"MileNorth is an OK hotel, maybe even good at it's price tag. The rooms are large and the interior has a modern touch to it, though it is not entirely up-to-date I'd say, it's between eighties classic and late nineties, might be updated once more. We had the option to opt out from housekeeping, which is great for two reasons; first of all it's better for the environment but you also get a 5$ voucher to spent at their breakfast/lunch eatery (Ferris & Jack). A definite minor would be the charge of $15 for hotel service fees (for 3 nights). First of all; not much service that we received/used would fit into such category, more important; never in the booking process jetsetter mentioned such a fee. When I pointed that out the staff was so kind as to drop this fee. The shared spaces in the hotel are comfortable, modern and stylish.",nan,nan,ta_s543
trip_advisor,We stayed in the Milenorth hotel in Chicago for week in May 2014 and again found it a very pleasent stay. It is a block from Michigan Avenue close to all the great shops on Magnificient mile. It is also about a 30 min walk to Millenium Park and Grant Park where you you could easily spend a few hours in the parks. The hotel itself was very clean and welll run and could find no fault with hotel or staff.I would recommend this hotel to anyone visiting Chicago.,nan,nan,ta_s544
trip_advisor,"This place was great with a great location and our room had an amazing view. It close to shopping and the John Hancock building and blocks from the beach. We had 75, 79, 76 degree weather it couldn't have been nicer. I wish it was closer to public transit but we ended up walking everywhere. The hotel has nice big room with a trendy vibe but the staff was mediocre not bad but not great. We had a family next to us who kids would run up and down the hall screaming at 5am when I complained they said they have a one strike policy and the next day it happened again I complained again and they said they will be warned. The next day we where leaving at 9 am so when it happened again I didn't complain because we where leaving and I had seen what 2 days of complaint had done. Otherwise this hotel was ok I think I will try another location next time.",nan,nan,ta_s545
trip_advisor,"We spent four days and three nights in Chicago with family; each family had their own room at the MileNorth hotel. The service was excellent, rooms clean, comfortable and spacious. I recommend this hotel and will stay there again.It is centrally located to many of the Chicago area attractions. So many restaurants you could hardly decide which one to choose. We look forward to when we can go back again.",nan,nan,ta_s546
trip_advisor,"I very much enjoyed all aspects of the Mile North Hotel. It offers everything needed along with a perfect location for enjoying all that the city has to offer. I would highly recommend the character and charm this hotel has to offer, along with all the amenities one would need in comparison to one of the large chain hotels.",nan,nan,ta_s547
trip_advisor,I decided to stay here because of the great reviews I read. I arrived a little earlier than check-in and it was no problem at all. I was taken to my room with in a few minutes and boy was it beautiful!! Great decor and perfect use of space. I wish the tub in the bathroom was deeper but totally not a deal breaker. My view was spectacular at night; the lights of the city are simply dreamy. The location was perfect for shopping and eating. The cafe in the lobby totally fed my addiction for Starbucks; loved it!! When I return to Chicago I will more than likely try my best to get back into MileNorth!!!!,nan,nan,ta_s548
trip_advisor,"I had a rough flight into Chicago and when I walked into the hotel, they upgraded me to a suite. It was so unexpected and it erased the previous awful 24 hours I had. The staff was so accommodating and the whole vibe of the hotel is trendy, fun, and modern. It's in a really safe and fun area, there is plenty of shopping and even a Trader Joe's in case you need groceries. I went for a run along the water and the front desk gave me a map so I felt confident about where to go.",nan,nan,ta_s549
trip_advisor,"I stayed at the MileNorth for 5 nights recently while helping a friend who was having major surgery at Northwestern Memorial Hospital. The hotel is one block from the hospital complex. It isw a half block off the Magnificient Mile, and near lots of attractions and restaurants, etc. The MileNorth is a boutique hotel with very helpful staff, a busy, but friendly and inviting lobby and spectacular rooms. My room had a king size bed, with fold out sofa in a separate living room area. Seating was comfortable, with a wonderful lounge chair included. Large windows overlooked the street below. In the lobby, you could get an informal breakfast, coffee, wine and snacks. Computers were there availabe for use, and helpful staff made using them a breeze. Daily newspaper was available for the taking along with area guides. The gym on the 7th floor was quite adequate. I did not get to try the lounge on the 29th floor but it sounded marvelous. Would definitely stay there again and again.",nan,nan,ta_s550
trip_advisor,"I usually pat myself on the shoulder making right choice when I go with tripadvisor's review and this was a quite unusual case. This was a mediocre hotel and indeed I didn't like their practice. There was a surprise charge every corner. My arrival at O'hare was 10:30AM. So I called the hotel front desk before making reservation several months before to confirm that they would do their best to accommodate early check-in as long as available. Arrival Day. After I picked up my luggage, I called the hotel and asked if there is availability for early check-in, they said there is a room and they will charge me $35 for early check-in. Unpleasantly surprised, I arrived at the hotel. Unlike what I heard on the phone, this person at the front desk gave me key without charging. Strange practice this hotel has. One night we were dining in one of the great steak houses in Chicago and had so much left overs. So I called the hotel to see if there is a microwave we can use in the hotel. I was told they can send a microwave to our room but we have to pay $35 for it. I asked whether that was a deposit. The person said no. The hotel is quite not accommodating. We had to leave all the great steak sides and left over steaks behind us. The last day morning, I saw a huge bill under the door. I called the front desk and asked what it was. The hotel fridge had nothing. Not even water. I used my phone the whole time. What else can it possibly be? They said they charge for WIFI and they charged every night! Excuse me? The hotel website does not say they charge for wifi anywhere and even when they gave me wifi password at check-in they never mentioned they will charge. Haha. This made me laugh. These guys are ridiculous. The person who answered the call offered to delete this charge with a strange reason ; ""Oh, you made a reservation a while ago"". Really? So if I made a reservation recently, then, I have to pay for Wifi when you never told me this is not free? Things they did quite made no sense to me. Very strange practice. The hotel did not look a sketchy establishment at all. Indeed, other than this strange/unaccommodating behavior of staffs, I thought the hotel was pretty decent. I paid good money for it too. Hence the disappointment was there.",nan,nan,ta_s551
trip_advisor,"A good hotel for our first visit to Chicago, good location to walk to everything you need and to get on a train and we felt safe in the area at night. It's approx 1hr from O'hare airport by train, one change required so not difficult and the same line will get you to the ball park too. Starbucks and bar in reception are convenient, rooftop bar is good but expensive. We went to Gino's next door for deep dish pizza, the hotel will give you a VIP pass to skip the queue and also a free entree! The bed at the hotel wasn't very comfortable and dipped in the middle and the safe wasn't usable nor fixed despite asking at reception a couple of times. I would still stay here again though.",nan,nan,ta_s552
trip_advisor,"The hotel exceeded all expectations. It's a stone's throw away from North Michigan Avenue, and a few minutes walk from public transport if you want to go further afield. Oh and it's right next door to Gino's pizza restaurant.For the price and location, I don't think we could have done better.The hotel is clean and stylish. The room we had was a queen-sized suite on the 18th floor and was very spacious. There was a safety deposit box in the room, as well as a hairdryer, iron, ironing board, toiletries (though no shower cap), coffee making facility, TV, sofa, reclining armchair, desk and dressing table. We also had a view of the John Hancock building from our window.Would definitely recommend the hotel, and if we're ever back in Chicago we'll certainly be using it again.",nan,nan,ta_s553
trip_advisor,"After more than a days worth of travel, we finally arrived at MileNorth in desperate need of some good food, restful sleep and some space to stretch out - Thankfully, MileNorth ticked all these boxes, and very well I might add.When we arrived, I sent down my wife to the in-house restaurant, and there she fetched us a couple of salads as a late night feed before we went to bed - the salads were both crop and fresh and actually very tasty, which left us pleasantly surprised!The room size was huge: we had a separate sitting area with sofa and coffee table and a entry mezzanine section with the writing desk (for those of you on business)! We also noticed how clean the rooms were kept both at the beginning and for the duration of our stay.Location is brilliant and the perfect base for exploring all sections of the city. We mostly walked our way through both the northern and southern parts of the city.There were however a couple of things that kept MileNorth just below the 5 star rating:The bed. While this is all personal preference, I personally found it difficult to wake up each morning without some form of back pain after sleeping in the very soft pillows and mattresses, so that's a heads up for you firm mattress sleepers!There was a lack of communication around the charges that I should expecting from my credit card when I checked in. Not only they held the price of the reservation, I was also charged the resort fee and a $60 a night bond amount for incidentals. While I appreciate these charges, it would have been nice for MileNorth to be upfront with these charges instead of me having to guess the pending charges from my credit card - especially when I rang the service desk one evening and nobody called back to clarify the charges I should be expecting.The last thing that annoyed me slightly was when we went to use the hotel safe, it was already locked, so we rang the reception area asking them to send someone to open the safe and the response was, 'I will organise someone from engineering to come to your room.' Needless to say, engineering never arrived!While each of these negatives, in my opinion, were only a small part of our stay, by no means would it impact our future stays, it's simply the little things that kept my review below 5 stars. Please take into consideration that the positives by far outweigh the negatives, so look no further for Chicago's best value for money option.",nan,nan,ta_s554

Danny the night manager was amazing. He was calm and helpful. He helped us phone the police, gave us helpful advice and probably most importantly gave us a complimentary drink. Thereafter he continually checked in with us to make sure we were ok. Thank you Danny. The guys in Ferris and Jack made sure we were fed and watered and had great chat. The room was huge and comfortable and we really enjoyed our stay. Following our trauma on the ' l ' the concierge organised our trip back to the airport which was highly efficient and a great joy.

trip_advisor,"I arrived at the hotel around 11PM on a Tuesday. When I checked in and went up to my room it sounded like popcorn was going off above my head (I recorded audio from the room). When I called down to say there is no way anyone with normal hearing could sleep with that noise the lady at the front desk offered me earplugs. I thought she was kidding. She was not. She said she would look into the problem. Now it is around 11:30PM and I have a meeting the next morning. Suffice it to say the fact that the hotel staff took no immediate steps to fix this situation was totally unreasonable in my eyes. When I checked back fifteen minutes or so later the lady informed me that they were fixing kitchen fans above the room I was in and that the rest of the rooms in the hotel were booked. She then offered me complementary breakfast in the morning. Once again I hoped she was joking. She was not. I had a meeting the following morning and it was almost midnight. I asked for the manager. She said she was the manager. Great. I assumed she was not truthful that the rooms were all full and so I tried that angle. After much aggravation, she finally moved me to another room. She was not pleasant about this and acted as if I should thank her for doing me a favor. In the room there were several places where wall paper was peeling and the toilet paper holding was falling off of the wall in the bathroom. I guess on the upside at least I had a place to sleep.",nan,nan,ta_s556

Had 8 cardio machines...dumbells from 5 to 50 pounds, a few machines.It just had a very cool, laid back vibe to it. It always had customers in the lobby, but it never had a busy, touristy feel to it.

trip_advisor,"I live in Chicago but on special occasions or family comes to visit, we stay in hotels around downtown Chicago. I have been to over a dozen, Mile North does not shape up. Not only are doors paper thin (we could hear everything in our hallway), the rooms do not keep noise out. We could hear our neighbors ALL night long. The beds made us wish to be back home, they are noisy and stiff and come with uncomfortable sheets and pillows. Also, our room we reserved 4 months in advanced, the hotel did not give us until the second night... due to giving it away to another guest who checked in before us. The first room we received was a smaller bed and some lamps did not work and neither did the fridge. The second room we received had the a/c and heat unit right next to the bed which would come on every hour blowing out either freezing air or hot hot air. The temperatures in both rooms were not accurate and we were either too cold or too hot. The people who work there are VERY nice and attentive, which is great... but when competing with all other Chicago Hotels, service is only one aspect. I will not be staying at Mile North again, nor will my friends or family. It is in a great location and while we didn't spend much time in our room, we were there to sleep... but didn't enjoy the little sleep we received.",nan,nan,ta_s562

The rooms are clean and spacious, and the hotel is close to many of the attractions Chicago has to offer. I would definitely stay here again. However, on this, my second trip, I was charged a ""Hotel Services Fee."" When I asked what this fee is for, I was told it is for services like the ""free"" wireless and ... (i stopped listening right there). I certainly don't mind paying $4.95 for some services, but don't tell me these services are ""free"" if I then am assessed a fee for them. If you want to increase the room rates by $5, great - go ahead and do so and *then* say the services are free (or, rather, included). But don't do what you're doing.

trip_advisor,"Unfortunately an otherwise perfectly good hotel stay was soured for a friend and I last week. We enjoyed the facilities at the hotel, the bar, the food was great in the restaurant and the room was spacious to fit two double beds comfortably. Our room was cleaned to a great standard every day and the staff were helpful when called upon.The negative review comes from the deposit system. We were informed upon arrival (something which in itself is unacceptable, all fees should be clearly outlined prior to booking), that my card would be charged $60 for each day we were there, and assured it'd be refunded within 3 to 7 days of check-out.It is now 9 days since returning to the UK... no refund, no correspondence, no replies to THREE emails and surveys in which I clearly outlined my concerns. This is totally unacceptable. If a system like this cannot be managed effectively in all instances, whether you're US or UK based, it should not be employed in the first place. The last thing I wanted to do was write a negative review of the hotel, because the trip itself was excellent and the hotel was exactly what we wanted. I'm now $300 out of pocket and with no word of an explanation as to if or when this money will ever be refunded. It is not a situation I have ever found myself in, but I am looking to escalate the issue if I do not receive correspondence and my deposit immediately. If you are uncomfortable about leaving your card or paying for a deposit when you stay at a hotel then steer clear of this hotel, as they evidently cannot guarantee that your money will be effectively managed and refunded.",nan,nan,ta_s564
trip_advisor,"I get to Chicago several times a year and have always stayed in the Loop. On a recent trip, I decided to try something different and ended up at MileNorth. I'm glad I did -- MileNorth will be my choice for future visits.The hotel is in a super location, just steps off of Michigan Avenue shopping. The lobby is welcoming, with comfortable seating and conversation areas. The registration desk is made from real suitcases and the attractive lobby bar/coffee shop is constructed from look like old library card catalog drawers. Staff are friendly, efficient and accomodating. Housekeeping is outstanding. My room was on the sixth floor (there are seven). Seeing it for the first time was a jaw-dropping experience. The room was huge and very well furnished. At one end, the bed with nightstands, a dresser, a chair with reading lamp, and on-the-wall TV. Toward the middle, a nice-size desk with good lights, another chair and small sofa, coffee table and a second wall-mounted TV. At the far end, clothes closet, refrigerator and coffee maker, and large, immaculate bathroom with walk-in shower (no tub). The hotel has a small, limited menu restaurant. (They plan to open a rooftop bar in spring 2014.) Buffet breakfast was tasty but pricey, as hotel breakfasts tend to be. I was more than pleased with MileNorth. To top it off, the price as about two-thirds of what I was accustomed to paying to stay in the Loop.In sum, MileNorth is a real find.",nan,nan,ta_s565
trip_advisor,"I surprised my mother for her birthday with a mini-getaway in downtown Chicago for the weekend. I booked the double bedroom at the Mile North. We live in Chicago and work right around the corner from the property. Here's how it went.Check-in: We checked in about 3:45 pm. The front desk advised that I would be required to pay a $60 per day incidental fee. I said fine. She explained that I would receive it back on check-out in full or minus any purchases. It went smoothly without incidents. Our room was ready. Room: Our room 709 was nice. We didn't have a great few but, that was okay. It was cold and snowy anyway. We took a few minutes to look around before starting our evening. We had a mini-fridge which was nice. I had bought a bottle of champagne in my suitcase. The room was very clean. No tub but a walk-in shower. The bathroom was huge! Nice and spacious. We had a desk with a chair. Instead of having a night on the bedside table the night light was on each bed's headboard. I liked that so each person has their own night light. I also liked the long pillow on the bed that contains the hotel name and symbol. The room was really nice and clean. Our room was cleaned on Saturday by the cleaning staff. The room smelled so good when we came back. Not like cleaning supplies but a mild floral, springy scent.Bar: There's a bar in the lobby where you can also purchase bar food. This is where we met Manny, our friendly and fabulous bartender. We gave him our drink orders. He was very attentive and personable. He asked were we visitors or natives. I explained that we are natives and I was treating my mother for her birthday. He made her a special birthday drink. Don't remember what was in it besides tequila but it was very tasty. We met some other patrons and we had a nice time. During our bar visit we also met the night manager of the hotel, Danny. He didn't drink but, he did participate in some of the conversations. He was also nice and friendly. We stayed there until the bar closed at midnight. There's a rooftop lounge at this hotel but, it was closed for cleaning during our weekend stay. We also visited the bar on Saturday night. Manny already knew what we wanted to drink. He remembered from the previous night. Danny also came over again. We also made sure to say goodbye to him since we would be checking out in the morning.Food: There's a restaurant in the lobby that serves breakfast and lunch but we didn't eat there. We did order food from an outside restaurant. They don't have room service but, that's not a deal breaker for me. I knew that when I made the reservations. I liked that the front desk called the room to make sure that we had ordered food prior to letting up the delivery guy. That made me feel safe. Believe or not, all hotels don't do that. Check-out: Check out was at noon. Here you don't do your normal check out where everyone surrounds the desk. They slip your final bill under the door overnight. I like that. No need to go to the desk unless there's a problem with the bill. It also makes checking out a breeze.All in all we really enjoyed our stay. The staff was professional and friendly all the time. When you leave and need transportation the doorman hails you a taxi. Ginos East pizza place is right next door. The hotel is convenient to all Chicago Magnificent Mile has to offer. Within walking distance to shopping, restaurants, movie theatres, and even a hospital. We really enjoyed ourselves and would recommend Mile North to anyone looking for a reasonably price, conveniently located, clean, and friendly hotel. Mile North will not disappoint you and we will definitely be returning in the near future.",nan,nan,ta_s566
trip_advisor,"This was our second stay at this hotel, and it was again exceptional. Great service, great location and the room was fantastic. You are right next to a bunch of shopping and the original Gino's East. The service is extremely friendly and accommodating as well. We got their suite again, which is spacious. There are some slightly different hotel policies I noticed - you have to be 21 to rent a room, they do not change your sheets / towels unless requested, no room service, the option of a $5 hotel credit if you don't get room service, and no wet bar or water in the room - but none effected us. I love the addition of the restaurant downstairs, they make a mean old fashioned.",nan,nan,ta_s567
trip_advisor,"So... I have not actually stayed here, but the pictures look gorgeous and living in Chicago, I know this is an AWESOME location. However, I called them for a room donation for a charity event that I am attending this weekend. They were more than generous and I was so grateful. I will recommend this hotel to anyone looking to stay in Chicago as they were overly accommodating and so friendly. Service like this is hard to come by and that makes them top notch in my book!",nan,nan,ta_s568
trip_advisor,"We got a groupon deal so did not pay an arm and a leg to stay at this hotel. No matter what the price, it was great. Centrally located for tourism needs, we walked there from the El with our luggage and didn't need a car.The hotel is beautifully decorated (bathroom was exceptionally great with a full tub and sea rte huge shower) and the lobby encourages relaxing as it has a Starbucks and a bar/restaurant. The staff was great, especially Dan M, who went above and beyond helping guests during our stay. If you are traveling to Chicago check this out. We were able to walk to wonderful restaurants, the Hancock tower, and took cabs to every place else. Beautiful even in the frigid winter.",nan,nan,ta_s569
trip_advisor,"My husband and I booked this hotel through expedia and thought it would be a wonderful ""luxurious"" king suite with a city view. We were assigned room 2408. The room was the first disappointment, the ""city view"" we paid extra for was basically impossible to see through the condensation (and later, frost) on the double pane windows. The suite was no bigger than a regular hotel room, there just had a bunch of wasted square footage by the door. There was a constant machine noise, presumably the compressors on tops of adjacent buildings, very noticeable from the bed area. The bathroom had no fan, and was right next to the bed- gross. The bed seemed small for a king. The staff was good and bad. We loved Joel at the door and Manny in the bar as well as breakfast staff but front desk staff left much to be desired. The customer service we enjoyed all over the city just never came to this front desk. I never felt that ""welcome"" feel. No room service, breakfast is buffet only NO MENU. Wifi was never able to connect. Overall, it was a disappointment and we will look for a more tried and true hotel in the future.",nan,nan,ta_s570
trip_advisor,"My husband and I stayed here on a Saturday night before a Bears game. We like to do a lot of shopping while in the city, so this was a perfect location. It's on a quiet side street a half a block off from the Magnificent Mile and within walking to tons of restaurants. We booked through groupon and got a great deal, and check in was super quick and easy. They also let us keep our bags there after check out so we still go and do things before and after the game. The modern rooms are very clean and spacious, and the beds are comfy. We stayed in the streeterville king which didn't have a great view,but that's not something that's important to us while in Chicago. Overall a perfect stay!Also, parking is $58/ day which is pretty comparable, so we also park at the grant park garages after dropping off our bags and take a cab back. It's much cheaper!",nan,nan,ta_s571
trip_advisor,"Stayed at the Mile North for six nights on a birthday trip to see the Blackhawks play. I travel often for work and pleasure and rate my hotels by cleanliness and friendliness. You can get the star rating from many places but your need this to find out this hotel is very clean, comfortable and the staff were very helpful from check in, to directions, to food recommendations. The location is exceptional for shopping, getting the train and going out to eat. This is not the Hilton but for home away feel and value it was spectacular.",nan,nan,ta_s572
trip_advisor,My husband and I celebrated our 1 year wedding anniversary by spending a weekend back at Mile North since we had the start to our honeymoon weekend a year ago here! We're so glad we came back. The hotel was completely remodeled since we'd last stayed and it looked great! We didn't book a Magnificent Mile room (wish we did!) like last year but we loved our stay anyways. Our room was very clean and always taken care of. We really love the location of this hotel. Water Tower Place is a few minutes away (walking) and you're around some very good restaurants and more shopping (again all within walking). The front desk staff always greeted us when we were coming and going and couldn't have been nicer. Thank you for having us for our anniversary! We really love this hotel. We will definitely be back (again!),nan,nan,ta_s573
trip_advisor,I live in Lake Villa Illinois and met my cousins from Iowa at the hotel for a quick over night visit. Annie and the front desk girls were great as well as Christine at the Bar. We sat at the bar and had a drink while they got our room ready. The room was beautiful and the view was amazing. The staff was very friendly and even the next day said hello and asked how our stay was.,nan,nan,ta_s574
trip_advisor,"I loved this hotel so much, I decided it's my pick for all future Chicago trips. It's a charming boutique hotel with a great vibe and an exceptionally warm and helpful staff. You cannot beat the location, a half block off of N. Michigan and just a block and a half from Water Tower Place. Also right next door to Gino's East, for tourists who have to try the famous pizza.Given the location, this hotel could probably charge double and halve the quality, and they would still get plenty of business. But the quality is really stellar, and the rate I paid was inexplicably low (although I did pre-pay weeks in advance, and the price went up 50% between then and my stay). The lobby is cozy and relaxed with boho decor, a surprisingly big cafe hidden in the back, and a nice bar to one side. There is also a small rooftop bar on the 29th floor, open during the summer. The decor is trendy but not annoyingly so. I didn't use the gym but I had a look and it was well equipped. Every staff person was great - special thanks to Anne at the front desk and the really nice doorman hailing taxis for us in the bitter cold.My room was one with a sunken level, where you descend a few steps from the bathroom/valet area to the bed. It was spacious, comfortable, and clean, with a great bed, fantastic pillows, and a good size TV. My only gripe is that the towels are terrible quality, not plush at all, but thin and dingy like gym towels. But honestly for how wonderful everything else was during my stay, I am not complaining.",nan,nan,ta_s575
trip_advisor,"Everything about this hotel is wonderful!  The staff was extremely nice, friendly & professional. The room: An ideal Chicago view (rm 411). It was very nicely appointed and large - including the bathroom! The beds are very comfortable and the bedding is of good quality. Most importantly, it was very very clean (the maids don't miss a spot of dust). The elevators and hallways were well kept and bright .The lobby style is eclectic - fun & funky. We had brunch at Ferris & Jack's (lobby bar/restaurant) and they have a small but well thought out menu. Location: The hotel is just down the block from Michigan and next door to Gino's East. Perfect location for anything on the north end of the Gold Coast.",nan,nan,ta_s576
trip_advisor,"Excellent hotel. Operated like a first class hotel should. Great location just off Michigan Ave. rooms are very clean and comfortable. We had a problem with a toilet. Talked with Hilary, the manager on duty, who worked hard to insure that we were relocated to a very nice room and the balance of the stay we were satisfied. The entire staff, from front desk to bellmen to housekeeping we're upbeat and friendly. Overall, a very nice experience.",nan,nan,ta_s577
trip_advisor,"Just steps from Michigan Avenue and next to Neiman Marcus AND Gino's famous deep dish (Jon Stewart went off on this iconic Chicago pizza) is the Mile North hotel.Small hotel featuring a small restaurant, Starbucks and cute little pastries sold in the lobby. Fireplace, plenty of comfortable seating makes the lobby a nice place to hang out on a crummy day.Rooms are lovely and classically appointed, thick towels....just a lovely experience.If you are looking for a great experience while you are staying in Chicago, look no further. Head to Mile North Hotel.",nan,nan,ta_s578
trip_advisor,"Stayed here again for a short visit. Lobby and restaurant area has been redone since I was here last. It has a very eclectic new lobby. I liked the new addition of the coffee bar, snacks and drink selections in the lobby area. I was upgraded to a queen suite, very nice to have the extra room. The new restaurant Ferris & Jack is still very good and reasonably priced for breakfast. Only one small problem with noisy guests in room next door late at night. I called the front desk and they seemed to resolve the problem but took about 45 minutes. Other than the noise, which I have never experienced here before, it was a great stay.Staff very friendly and accommodating. Again great location if you want to be up north off of Michigan Ave. Nice hotel!",nan,nan,ta_s579
trip_advisor,"Just got back from a 6 night stay at the Mile North Hotel, had a great room really quiet as we requested a high floor a couple of days before we arrived , had a fridge in the room which we found useful there is a Walgreens on the next block so we could fill the fridge with beer and wine. The hotel gave us vouchers for $20 a day to use In the coffee/ bar in the reception area which was a bonus , the staff where very friendly and helpful not like other Chicago hotels I would definitely stay again",nan,nan,ta_s580
trip_advisor,"This was a girls trip, 4 of us stayed & all of us had great rooms, very comfortable beds, clean - perfect location.Only complaint was that was they would charge $29 for an early check in. I've never heard of such a thing. Most nice hotels gladly do early check ins when available & never charge.All desk people, doormen, bartenders - very niceLoved decor of rooms, lots of nice touches- Chicago themed shower curtains, nice lighting by bed& great lobby",nan,nan,ta_s581
trip_advisor,"This hotel is conveniently located in the middle of the Magnificent Mile where there are many shopping and dining options nearby. It's about 15 minutes walk from the subway station (I emailed the hotel prior to arrival and promptly received a very detailed email giving me directions from the station), and the neighbourhood was quite safe. The hotel must have had a recent update as the lobby and rooms were very modern, both very clean. The check-in staff was very friendly and check-in process was very quick without any hassles. The room was quite spacious for big city hotels, and the bed and pillows were very comfortable. The only downsides where that ice machine was only available at certain floors, and the wifi signal in my room was quite poor, possibly due to the room location.Overall I had a great stay at the MileNorth, and I would recommend it to anyone visiting Chicago. Make sure you also check out Nordstrom Rack for some incredible bargains!",nan,nan,ta_s582
trip_advisor,"If you're in Chicago and find good enough hotel whether for business for holiday, Mile North will do. It's located just round the corner of Michigan ave. Just behind Disney Store and 1 block away from Apple stores. Hershey store, Ghiralldeli, Cheese factory, John Hancock building just 5-10 min walk away..However the room is relatively small and no breakfast, eventhough there's Starbuck counter downstair.",nan,nan,ta_s583
trip_advisor,"We stayed at the Mile North for the first time. We had a nice quiet, spacious room on the 22nd floor street side. The hotel was clean and very accommodating staff. Everyone was friendly.They have a restaurant in the hotel, as well as a lobby bar...we didn't get a chance to eat there.The location of the hotel is 1 block off of Michigan and we took the subway in from O'Hare...the red line is a short walk which was very convenient. I would recommend this hotel due to the cleanliness, employees, and the location.",nan,nan,ta_s584
trip_advisor,"Booked 3 nights. They had attractive rates, and we liked the location. Here's the good things first:Excellent location, in the middle of Magnificient Mile. We were able to walk everywhere, all the way down to the loop and back, no problem.The loft suite we got was great, good size, nice layout.We got a high floor, but it didn't matter much, as there are taller buildings all around so not much of a view.All the staff we met were marvelous. From bell hop, to check in, to check out.Here's the not-so-good:The cleanliness of the washroom was just short. First day there was a slight 'smell', like maybe the mop they used wasn't very clean. Not a major problem, so we didn't reported it, and certainly didn't want to change rooms once we unpacked. It got better on the 2nd and 3rd night.Also, the cleaners let the toilet paper run low and didn't change the roll nor provide an extra roll. By the 3rd day we were out! Had to use the facial tissue, or else would have had to call for help! I've never seen such carelessness in all the hotels I've stayed at.The bed was terrible, it sank in the middle. We had a terrible sleep on the 1st night, and got used to it gradually the following nights. We figured this was one thing they didn't upgrade in their renovations, so again just decided to live with it. Wasn't until we moved to the next hotel, the Hyatt Place in Naperville, that we realized how bad the bed here was (Yes, the Hyatt House was EXCELLENT. See my review).Lots of good things going for this hotel, and I would recommend it, especially if you find a good rate. The cleaning staff, well, You go to the next floor and it may be a differnet experience, so not a big deal. But the bed is a high priority item in my book, and because they didn't do well in that, I could only give it a 3 star. I don't believe the Expedia rating of 4 stars for this hotel is quite right either. Perhaps a 3.5 in my opinion.",nan,nan,ta_s585
trip_advisor,"There's so much to really like about this hotel, but each time I come back to stay I can't help but think, ""man I miss the old Affinia Hotel Chicago days."" Especially the pillow menu that Affinia used to offer.The location of the MileNorth is straight up AWESOME. 1/2 a block from Michigan Ave on a fairly quiet street, right next to Gino's East, so close to many other sightseeing, shopping and eating opportunities.The rooms are fairly spacious, but there is an inconsistency between the room experiences. Some have really nice bathrooms with sunken tubs, others make you feel like you're staying at a Holiday Inn, and could use some definite updates.I will say that I LOVE the updates that have been made to the lobby area, the redesign definitely opens up the space more, and the addition of the bar and coffee area is great. The elevators are still pretty slow though.While this is still a fairly good hotel, it has fallen on my list of favs in Chicago. Hopefully there are more updates to the MileNorth in the near future.",nan,nan,ta_s586
trip_advisor,Great location and very spacious suites although we didn't have any blinds or curtains in our room which made us feel a bit exposed! My brother and his wife had a suite on a higher floor which was magnificent with a sunken bath and walk in shower. As we were only staying there for 1 night we didn't get a chance to use the roof top patio bar which looked fabulous. Only downside was they couldn't get us out quick enough on day of departure.,nan,nan,ta_s587
trip_advisor,"The hotel is well equipped, and the rooms are very nice. I was on the 27th floor but facing away from Superior Street (room 2704) which meant that I was looking at the office building next door. If you want city views, then ask for a high room facing Superior. The location of the hotel is excellent - very near Michigan Avenue and a short walk to most central attractions. There is also a good restaurant (Ferris and Jack) on the ground floor - which has a good selection of drinks and food. On the downside - the reception staff are some of the most miserable I've encountered. Even the simplest of questions (such as check out time) seemed like a terrible burden to them. I would have expected a better standard of service from this type of hotel. In addition, the walls to the rooms are very thin. I was woken early every day by the cleaners having loud conversations in the hallway.",nan,nan,ta_s588
trip_advisor,"Hotel number four on my Great Rail trip from LA to New York. I absolutely loved Chicago for its architecture, culture, transport system and its people. The hotel is located off the ""Magnificent Mile"", the trendy north side of the city with big name stores (and big prices) nearby. My room 609 was huge for just one person, and if it had a kitchen, it would be a smart city apartment. There was a king size bed, sofa, armchair, two TVs, fridge, safe, coffee machine etc. and a large bathroom with shower big enough to accommodate a close friend or two!! My only criticism of the room was that it looked across to a skyscraper which kept a lot of natural light out, and there was inadequate lighting to compensate. Nevertheless, it is a smart hotel and the food and service were very good. There is a bar on the top floor (number 29 I think) from which good views can be had.The public transport system in Chicago, the CTA, is also very good. A 24-hour travel card costs just $10 from a nearby supermarket (Walgreens), and a trip on THE LOOP (The EL) is a must. I would definitely like to see more of Chicago; in fact I much preferred it to New York, my final stop on this epic journey.",nan,nan,ta_s589
trip_advisor,"The hotel is in a good location for shopping, restaurants, Lake Michigan etc. The room and bathroom was large, clean and nicely decorated. Unfortunately the views were not that great for a city view room (I was on floor 12) but there was no noise from the city (apart from the evening storm!). The staff were very helpful and polite and I couldn't have asked for more. Gino's pizza, two doors away, has the most amazing pizza I have ever tasted so I recommend trying that - go for deep pan! I would definitely stay here again and I would recommend to others.",nan,nan,ta_s590
trip_advisor,"Stayed one night. The rooftop lounge is very fun with a good view of the city. Lots of restaurants in the area. I booked the room directly through the hotel service and was given an upper level floor room for the same price as the lower level rooms. The reservationist was VERY nice,helpful and knowledgeable regarding information on Chicago. Yes, there is a charge for valet parking but it is worth it. You have unlimited in/out privileges. This is very common for Chicago hotels. There IS a parking ramp kitty corner to the hotel across the street though but I don't know the rates. Also there is a children's hospital next door so they may have available parking. The beds were very comfortable and there was a mini-fridge (no extra charge) and no annoying honor bar.",nan,nan,ta_s591
trip_advisor,I stayed at the MileNorth after purchasing a night from Hotwire. The hotel is located just east of Michigan on Superior. I often forget about hotels in this area. Plenty of shopping and restaurants in the area. The hotel room was large and very comfortable. The hotel lobby is interesting with a Starbucks/breakfast bar in the morning that turns to a Bar in the evening. Overall nice place and I will go back..,nan,nan,ta_s592
trip_advisor,"Great location, friendly staff and a good night's sleep what more do you want? Yes there were few minor cosmetic issues in the bathroom that should be attended to but the room was modern, and clean and the beds were comfortable. I always love rooms that included a mini-refrigerator. So we went around the corner and picked up drinks and snacks to have the next day. Especially, convenient for visiting the American Girl Place. The rooftop bar was really nice and I regret that we didn't have time to enjoy it since the weather was unusually nice for the end of July.My husband really liked having a recliner in the room. I liked having the split level - it really was unique for a hotel room. Just don't trip at night finding the bathroom. ;)",nan,nan,ta_s593
trip_advisor,"My friend and I spent 2 nights here in July as a girls' getaway. We had a room on the 5th floor facing an alley. Couldn't get the shade to pull up, so we had to have it closed the whole time, which was a bummer, since we're sun-lovers! I loved how large the room was (which is especially nice when sharing with a friend as opposed to a partner), and the bathroom was huge for a downtown hotel. We found the ""Jetsons"" beds to be funky, but not luxuriously comfortable. Comfy beds are pretty huge on my list, and these were just ok. There were a lot, and I mean, a LOT of black, curly hairs on the throw pillows on my bed (I took pictures), which pretty much grossed me out. I expect a high level of cleanliness and attention to detail when I'm paying a premium for a good location. The rest of the room was clean, but the kick boards on the floor as well as the ceiling are already showing some serious wear and tear. I think more than anything, the rooms suffer from a bit of aesthetic confusion. As if they want to be modern and interesting, yet don't really hit the mark; mixing random colors and textures with an overall sense of minimalism. Nothing felt very cohesive in terms of design, but if you don't care about that, it's a fabulous location for a reasonable price. We enjoyed the rooftop bar and deck for about 10 minutes before it closed (we were the only ones there, and to be fair, it was 11:45 on a Monday night), and probably would have gone back, but with no drink happy hour, found the prices to be a little prohibitive. Parking in the area is a pain (to be expected in downtown Chicago), and the valet is pricey. We opted to park in a cheaper part of town for the bulk of the day, then moved our car to the side streets off the hospital next door where you can park for free from midnight to 8am. A huge hassle if you are there to sleep in, but we were up and about each morning, so not a big deal for us. Staff is very friendly and helpful, cafe in the lobby was a nice perk, and seriously, this hotel is walkable to everything. For the money, I'd probably spend a bit more and try something else next time, but wouldn't hesitate to recommend the Mile North to other travelers.",nan,nan,ta_s594
trip_advisor,"I had a split-level room on the 26th floor, with modern decor, that was spotlessly clean. All of the staff that I encountered were exceptionally attentive & friendly (from the Doormen, to the Front Desk staff, the Bellhop & the morning Barista in the Lobby). I was in Chicago for testing at Northwestern Hospital & the location was very exceedingly convenient (since the Northwestern Hospital is basically located across the street from the hotel). I will definately stay here again & will certainly recommend the hotel to my friends.",nan,nan,ta_s595
trip_advisor,"Clean and modern with a nice bar, decent restaurant (or if you want pizza, it's next door to Gino's East ). The rooms are above average in size and are well furnished in a modern mode. The staff was uniformly nice and the location is excellent - it's a block from Michigan Ave, a block from Water Tower Place, and 3 1/2 blocks from the EL. There was nothing to criticize on a recent stay, but nothing to rave about, either.",nan,nan,ta_s596
trip_advisor,"This week was my first stay at a Hard Rock hotel property. I am a loyal Marriott customer but couldn't get into any of their properties in Chicago this week. I selected the Hard Rock pretty much by chance. I thoroughly enjoyed my stay. The staff was extremely courteous, the rooms clean and the location is right in the heart of everything. The hotel was fully booked yet I never felt that things were all that hectic or out of control. I recommend the Hard Rock in Chicago to anyone looking for a great hotel experience.",nan,nan,ta_s597
trip_advisor,"Hard Rock Hotel in Chicago has a great location on the very South end of the Miracle Mile and about 1 block from Millennium Park. This is right in the heart of downtown Chicago. 2 blocks from the ""L"", 2 blocks from Intelligence Coffee, 1 block from the Chicago river, 2 blocks from awesome shopping and restaurants....can't really ask for a more convenient location.The people who work there are FRIENDLY! Very! The price is very reasonable and the building is a famous structure out side and very modern inside.My only complaint this from this trip is that the shower needed some slight mildew removal and could use a better shower head in the shower.I've stayed here many times now and as before...it ROCKED me once again!",nan,nan,ta_s598
trip_advisor,"We stayed here over a weekend in April and found the location perfect. Staff were great and the standard rooms are very big. Hotel decor is very cool, even the outside is green terra cotta and gold! We went for a walk and bumped into 'the bean' just around the corner. We bought a hop on hop off tour pass and one of the stops is just a block away from the hotel. Very convenient. Walking distance to great shopping on magnificent mile.",nan,nan,ta_s599
trip_advisor,"We stayed at the Hard Rock this past weekend for our wedding anniversary. I have to say the very best thing about this hotel is the location. I really do not think you can do better on location for this price.The outside of the hotel is beautiful and easy to identify when you are walking around. The lobby is small but very cool and has a great energy to it. The ping pong table was in use nearly every time we went by it. It seemed like a weird thing to have in a hotel lobby, but was really fun to see people laughing and having a good time with it! The furniture in the lobby is super cool and comfortable. The check-in staff was efficient, friendly and when we arrived about an hour early had no problem getting us in to our room. We really appreciated that!The bar was nice, the drinks were pricey but strong and the DJ playing really made it enjoyable to hang out in there. The service was hit or miss on friendliness, it was never over the top great but never horrible either. It was kind of bummer when trying to order a Cucumber martini from the specialty cocktail menu that they didn't have the supplies to make it. Find a new recipe or remove it from the menu, it sounded like this drink had been unavailable for quite a while, not just this weekend.Now...the room. Ugh! We were really excited to be spending our anniversary weekend at the Hard Rock, but the room was in a condition that I can't imagine they are willing to put their brand on. The colorful touches you see in the pictures on the website were totally missing. The lamp was stained. I can't even imagine how the lampshade was stained in this way, but it did not give me a feeling of cleanliness. It wasn't even plugged in, maybe in hopes we wouldn't turn it on and notice? The bathroom door was water damaged. The bathroom grout was dingy and gray. I feel like (hope) that this was more of a worn out issue than a cleanliness issue, but it evoked a feeling of not wanting to go in to the shower barefoot for sure. I thought it was great that they had a magnification mirror installed, but the light on it wasn't in working order. The mini-fridge was empty of any snacks or drinks, this was okay with me though as I then avoided the temptation to pay $7 dollars for a Snickers bar and that gave us a small fridge to use instead. A decorative decal on the wall was starting to peel off on the edges. This was DEF not the cool/hip Hard Rock experience we were hoping for. The beds and pillows were comfortable and provided a good nights sleep. The linens were clean and comfortable and we were happy for that.If you are in Chicago to see the city and want a truly excellent location for a great price and don't care about the room, this might be the hotel for you! We got a great deal on the room and I think it was the least expensive in this prime area for site-seeing. We could walk to 'The Bean' easily and never had a taxi ride that cost over 10 dollars (pre-tip) to anywhere we wanted to go. IF you are in Chicago for a romantic getaway and DO care about the condition of the room, you may want to skip the Hard Rock.",nan,nan,ta_s600
trip_advisor,"I would not pay over 200 for this hotel! I got an extremely amazing deal through groupon, otherwise I would not have stayed here! I saw in reviews it was run down but I didn't think so... My room was very spacious and it didn't look worn out at all! The check in was 3 but we got there early and got to check in at 10 am, that was a huge plus in my book. The room definitely could've been cleaner. I found ""skid"" marks on my sheets and the furniture was greasy. And one thing that really made me upset was a man working at the hotel with a foreign accent came knocking on our door at 9:00 am and yelling something we could not make out and then just let himself in!!! I personally thought it was very rude! The bartender did not know much about making drinks. The atmosphere of this hotel is amazing ,the staff were really friendly, the room was really nice, like I said could've been cleaner and the location was good. I would probably stay again if I got a good deal!",nan,nan,ta_s601
trip_advisor,"My husband, daughter and myself stayed here for a family vacation. We stayed for five nights it was incredible. The location was amazing we only took a taxi one time otherwise we were able to walk everywhere we even walked to shedds about 2 miles but a lot to look at! There are a lot of closer thing s too only about 2 blocks from mellinium park which is incredible!! The staff was wonderful smiling faces and always pleasant. Defiantly going to stay here every trip to Chicago room was awesome. Every aspect of the hotel from the service to the different things to look at made our vacation wonderful. They also do guitar rentals but the kicker is you have to have a 500 dollar deposit which they refund when you return the guitar but still have to have the deposit. Loved it!!!",nan,nan,ta_s602
trip_advisor,"My husband and I stayed here for two nights with our two children (one being an infant). We were upgraded (twice) and wound up with a Platinum Queen room, which we were very grateful for. There was a building being constructed outside our window. We enjoyed watching the construction, but it may have bothered couples, or other families that don't have construction enthusiasts. We liked the location of the hotel. There were many restaurants nearby and we could see Millennium Park from our window. We used the transit system while in town and the concierge was very helpful in getting us on the right bus, which wasn't that difficult from the hotel.Overall, the room was clean, the staff was outstanding, and we were very happy that we chose the Hard Rock for our family vacation.",nan,nan,ta_s603

From this hotel, we were able to easily walk up to the Water Tower, over to Navy Pier, Millennium Park and into the South Loop district for deep dish pizza!Only drawback is the high parking rates for storing your vehicle.The hotel was clean, the atmosphere funky and the staff was very hospitable.Overall, a very enjoyable weekend stay. Highly recommended!",nan,nan,ta_s604
trip_advisor,"I can't give it five stars because it didn't meet expectations. A name like Hard rock should inspire perfection. Why not perfect? First what was good: people. Very friendly and helpful staff. Concierge directed us to great breakfast, desk staff recommended using ell to get to midway rather than a cab (good call), room service delivered a glass of wine one evening very happily, room service breakfast was awesome (eggs Benedict for son, scrambled eggs for me) neat memorabilia throughout. Room good sized, bed comfortable, room quiet. Ideal location. ..steps from millenium park, state street, public transport to major attractions. Ping pong in lobby. South water kitchen around corner. Just loved location. Here is my criticism: they're was no room service menu nor hotel amenities binder in room and we asked four separate times. Asked concierge on way out, nothing. Asked front desk about it, as well as mini bar restock, mini bar was restocked but no binder. Called room service and got copy of breakfast menu delivered, finally called again and got full menu delivered. But never got hotel directory binder. 2nd criticism: strong sulfurous/rotten egg odor when we came back after shopping first day, which dissapated but horrible smell (like stale poop) lingered. We febreezed bathroom every time we walked in but never solved it. Didn't complain because didn't figure it mattered as room was fine. 3rd minor thing: only 2 towels left last day. Would I stay again? Yes if price was right . But more than $130/night I'm going somewhere else.",nan,nan,ta_s605
trip_advisor,"We stayed here the other evening for a quick get away. We arrived an hour before check-in and they didn't hassle us at all. We got a room and were able to go right up. The room was large, and so was the bathroom. Beds were comfy and they were very clean. The hotel was very quiet for being a holiday weekend with lots of stuff going on in Chicago that weekend. It's in a great location to be able to get taxi's or within a quick walking distance to pretty much anything you would want.",nan,nan,ta_s606
trip_advisor,"My husband and I stayed here for three nights! Its in a good location, lots of places to eat close by and we enjoyed the short walk to the main places. We had a room with a king size bed, it was very clean, but the room was pretty small. The bed was comfortable and you have a coffee pot in the room. There is no refrigerator that you can use or microwave. The bathroom was very small! There is no way two people can try and get ready at the same time...which was a problem for us! There is also a safe in the room! The staff was very nice and the hotel was very modern! All in all, we would stay here again!",nan,nan,ta_s607
trip_advisor,"The Hard Rock has proved to be an excellent choice for a father soon trip to Chicago. The location is great, on Michigan Avenue just between the Loop and the Magnificent Mile.The hotel is a beautiful historic sky scraper but it is just starting to show tiredness following its 2004 opening, a refurbishment (at least of the standard rooms) is needed. Front desk and housekeeping were good and non intrusive and because we were here for so long we were offered free internet access. Overall the Hard Rock Hotel is very good and if you can get a good rate then it is recommended but be aware there are better choices out there.",nan,nan,ta_s608
trip_advisor,"My boyfriend and I wanted a place to stay for a weekend get away and thought this place would be different yet perfect for the location and just for the experience. I have to say, it was not worth it. Our room wasn't ready for 3 hours. Yes they gave us complimentary drinks at chucks (which is a great restaurant by the way), but we had reservations for dinner to go to later on the night which we had to change. They also offered us another room, but for 2 queen size beds when I paid for a king size bed room, I didn't accept. But when we finally got to ours room, it was still not worth the stay. The lampshade was damaged in our room and fridge had missing beverages, which I mentioned to the front desk just so I wasn't charged, which he said I won't be. While checking my balances on my statements after staying there, I was charged. I still haven't gotten my money back. It was frustrating and definitely not worth my money. While calling I was also handed over to 3 different associates and all gave me different stories about why I was charged. While I thought the workers were friendly, I didn't think they were very professional. I recommend staying somewhere else in the city of Chicago.",nan,nan,ta_s609
trip_advisor,"I had several problems:1. I was not asked if I needed help with my luggage.2. The dresser in my room was damaged on both sides.3. The tile on my bathroom floor was loose.4. Room Service was closed on a Friday night and when I asked front desk about it, I was told to walk to 7/11 to get something to eat.5. I was locked out of my room at least 30 minutes prior to check out and had to wait several minutes causing me to check out 20 minutes late. -As a result of being locked out, I missed my train and was delayed 5 hours. I also had to pay a $45 charge when I traded my ticket in after missing my original train.-When I called and complained, Will was not apologetic. He blamed me for the key not working. He said that I must have had it with my credit cards.-After getting no where with Will, I asked for the corporate number, he told me that I could call corporate but they are not going to do anything to help me, so I should just talk to him.",nan,nan,ta_s610
trip_advisor,"The Hard Rock in Chicago is an excellent location. Just south of the Chicago river and one block away from the magnificent mile makes this hotel the perfect location. There are many restaurants and shopping within a short walking distance. The hotel itself is clean, comfortable and the staff is friendly. I would recommend booking parking ahead of time as the hotel does offer parking however, it is 60 dollars per day and you can find better rates if you are willing to walk a few blocks. Wifi is available however there is a charge per night per device. I asked and the front desk gave me complimentary Wifi for two devices. I would definitely recommend this hotel.",nan,nan,ta_s611
trip_advisor,"For the second portion of our trip, I decided to stay at the Hard Rock Hotel Chicago for a third time. As you may know, many of the floors of this hotel have a musician theme. The first time, I stayed on the AC/DC floor. The second was the Elvis floor. This time, we ended up on the B.B. King floor. (I'm still holding out for the Cheap Trick floor, having seen them in concert back home in Fort Wayne last summer.)Much of what I mentioned from my previous review two years ago still stands. The service is still excellent, and I have to give a nod to Zack at the front desk for checking us out in a fast manner so we could make our train back to Indiana on-time. The rooms are still very clean and spacious, and there's now some new fun touches like a shag pillow. The beds are still some of the best that I have slept on in a hotel. The shower experience was still great, with good water pressure, great toiletries, and thick towels. There's still a Keurig in the room - remember, if you have a certain kind of K-Cups that you like, you can use them.But I'd like to touch on three new subjects. The first one is Chuck's at breakfast. Last time I was here, I had lunch there, and I decided to try them for breakfast. I had an amazing melt-in-your-mouth waffle, and my father had the Red Velvet Pancakes that he loved, too. The second is their on-site gym, which I used for the first time on this visit. It's small, but it makes up for the size with really good equipment like high-tech treadmills and Nautilus systems. Spa services are also available, but I didn't use them. The third is Verizon reception. Last time I was here, I had AT&T, and Ma Bell's reception was perfect, while my mother had good results with Sprint as well. But Verizon's reception here requires you to be near a window to get good call quality. I just wanted to give this as a public service announcement for all the Verizon users.Overall, this was another great visit to the Hard Rock Hotel. Will I be back for a fourth time? You can bet on it.",nan,nan,ta_s612
trip_advisor,"This was my first time staying at a Hard Rock Hotel and it was an awesome experience. Friendly staff, clean rooms, and a great location for tourists. The concierge were great at filling us in with all of the local places to go and things to do. Parking was confusing if you didn't use the valet service but, it was still a great distance from the hotel. I will definitely be staying again.",nan,nan,ta_s613
trip_advisor,"By the photos you'd assume it was close to immaculate but it is not. I booked a King Tower room, which is a king size bed in a bi-level room I suppose but the one I was given was not impressive. The bed was a full/queen and it was less than 2ft from the door. There were 3 steps down into an area with a couch and a table (?), just a poor design all around yet the hotel staff, with big bright smiles assured me I'd love it. I didn't love it and they kindly changed me to another room immediately. Although the bathrooms in both rooms were just fantastic, the wear and tear on the hotel is noticeable. Expected better from the Hard Rock but I guess 4 star ratings don't mean much anymore. Staff and location was excellent by the way, close to many restaurants and just steps away from the shops on Michigan ave.",nan,nan,ta_s614
trip_advisor,"My boyfriend and I stayed there for St. Patrick's weekend. It was abnormally warm so we tried to turn the AC on. To our surprise, they had not turned their coolers on so there was no AC. We had to crack the window. Then at night it gets cold so we turn the heat on, but the electric heat had not been on in about a year, per the engineer, and it was burning the dust off which caused a horrible smell and the fire alarm to go off. Needless to say, do not stay there during this time of the year. Not worth what we paid.",nan,nan,ta_s615
trip_advisor,"My fiance and I stayed here for a date night. We arrived Saturday afternoon, went up to the room and then went to dinner. The floors each have a theme. We were on the Elvis floor in a corner room. When we got off the elevator, it smelled like pot a little, but we are young so that didn't bother us. We were able to take 5 minute cabs every where because it was chilly this weekend! It is in a great location. We went down to the bar for a drink and also went to the gift shop to get some stuff for our family. The rooms are smaller, but cozy! We loved the theme of our room and our king size bed was perfect for us! We took a cab to RPM and to the beach to go watch the Polar Plunge. It was fun!",nan,nan,ta_s616
trip_advisor,"Went to Chicago for a couple of days with my 10 year old daughter. We really enjoyed this hotel! It is in a great location off of Michigan Ave, we walked to everything. The staff was very helpful and friendly. The housekeeper on the 7th floor was so nice to my daughter and greeted us in the hallway overtime we went to our room. We had a corner room with a great view of the water and street. The room was nice and spacious for Chicago and clean. We also loved that you could have an electric guitar delivered to the room for free and play ping pong in the lobby.",nan,nan,ta_s617
trip_advisor,"My husband and I stayed in room 1104 the weekend before Christmas. BEAUTIFUL corner room! We were celebrating my 40th birthday that weekend and had an amazing time. Room was clean. The first night I was woken up by the person next door blasting music, after two hours ( Don't want to be the old woman next door complaining) but I called down to front desk and with in a few minutes someone was up to our floor knocking on their door. So why do I give a one star rating when everything was great? I brought my VERY EXPENSIVE leather jacket that weekend. When I unpacked I hung it in the closet. The day we were checking out we woke up late and rushed to get packed so we could check out on time. Now...I used to be in the hotel business, so it's really important to have guests check out on time because of the time it takes to clean rooms. Well, I rushed so fast to be a good guest that I had totally forgot to grab my leather jacket out of the closet. I called a few days later AND WOULD YOU BELIEVE housekeeping hadn't found anything.....gee. I used to find gold watches and jewelry way more expensive then my jacket and I always turned it in. I will never stay at this hotel or any other Hard Rock. If this is the staff you hire and trust then I want NO PART OF IT.Happy friggen 40th birthday to me! Had that jacket for years! GONE! In one failed attempt to be on time. Lesson learned.",nan,nan,ta_s618
trip_advisor,"We booked one night at this hotel to follow an event in Chicago. We had to valet the car- it was pricey at 60.00- but good till 5pm the next day. Super helpful concierge, desk guys and car, baggage guys. The room was sparse but comfortable. Looked a little worn out. Great view of the river though. If you are a Hard Rock Rewards member you get points and later check out which was a plus. The hotel in Chicago does not have a Hard Rock restaurant attached but does have a nice shop.",nan,nan,ta_s619
trip_advisor,"last weekend we had a stay at the hard rock hotel chicago and i would like to say it was good. the room was comfortable with comfy beds, but found a few glitches (didn't really bother me)...lights sconces between the beds were loose and and the fridge was not stocked with pop...didn't feel like getting tipsy that night. the bathroom was nice and well appointed with lots of towels and toiletries by rock spa. the lobby was small and nicely furnished with groovy chairs and even a ping pong table while you wait. the angel and king bar was dark...a bit dark and felt it was more of a cougar bar (no offense) and found it was not a place for hip younger people to hang out in (i think it was the sub-freezing temperatures outside keeping them away)...the history of the building is unique and the black granite tiles on the outside were all pulled off and replaced in better condition after an expensive refurbishment. the 1929 built tower top has the crown covered in a thin layer of 24 karat gold leaf and looks, as popular legend says (from the book in the room)...connects the design of the building to a champagne bottle, with the terra cotta exterior corresponding to the green glass bottle and the golden tower alluding to the shiny foil top. each floor of the hotel represents each rock star we have and do know of...some floors, like ours were left in its original 1930's condition feeling like an office worker when we walked out onto the 13th floor for our room",nan,nan,ta_s620
trip_advisor,"I stayed here for a weekend getaway with my sisters and mother in-law. Julie upgraded us since we were celebrating a special occasion and we were on the 19th floor with an amazing city view. I love that this hotel offers two queen beds instead of two double beds- it's helpful when you're sleeping next to friends and not your spouse! It was also very clean which is very important. We used a Groupon for this weekend and it was an amazing deal for the type of hotel we were looking for. Fantastic location right on Michigan Ave and the front desk staff were friendly and down to earth. I liked it so much that I'm coming back with my husband next weekend.

trip_advisor,"During this past weekend I had the pleasure of staying two nights at the Hard Rock Hotel in Chicago, IL. I enjoyed it very much. The atmosphere is amazing along with the architecture and style of the whole hotel. I would suggest this hotel for anyone staying in Chicago for even one night. The rooms are awesome, the views are great, the staff is friendly and the hotel is in a perfect location. Not to mention the bar is great! Don't think twice about it, rock out and book your stay if you want a night to Remer remember.",nan,nan,ta_s622
trip_advisor,"Stayed between Aug 8 & 11, 2014. Couple.Flew in from Toronto and ended up being quite early (10am) for check in (3pm). We checked in and left our bags with the hotel and they advised they would give us a call when a room was ready. Toured around and grabbed lunch (deep dish pizza) and received a call around 11:30am advising our room was ready. Our room was on the 18th floor (Lenny Kravitz). Room wasn't anything spectacular. Typical hotel room layout. Bed was large and comfortable. Washroom could be larger, but no real complaints. Only real thing to watch is on the dresser there is a weight sensitive tray with snacks that when items removed, are charged to your credit card. Same goes with the fridge. I knocked over something and called downstairs to inform them I didn't eat anything and they told me you have approx. 10 seconds to put it back with no charge. I was charged and they made note of my call and I didn't see the charge upon checkout. There is wifi in the room which was nice. We used the business center to surf online and print our return flight details. There is a lounge/bar downstairs that we went to once, it was ok. It wasn't busy when we went though. Only issue (if you would call it that) was that our floor's ice machine didn't work and neither did the one below or above. We had to go two floors down or up. Not a biggie, just annoying. We advised the front desk and they ended up sending up ice in a bucket and told us to call when we needed it, which was nice. You can't beat the location of the hotel. Right smack in the middle of downtown Chicago, easy access to transit, stadiums and tourist attractions. Overall, if we went to Chicago again, we would definitely stay at the Hard Rock again. Great place to stay.",nan,nan,ta_s623
trip_advisor,"DO NOT GO HERE FOR NEW YEAR'S EVE! Do NOT buy a party ticket and do NOT stay in a room for the night! The rooms are outdated and the staff was completely overwhelmed. Our safety was in jeopardy.To start the night, my group of eight friends and I were forced to wait outside for 25 minutes at 9:30 in order to 'check in' to the event; a ridiculous notion, considering an email from your promotional organization was sent the day before advising women to ""only bring a coat if you really need one"", and the temperature outside was below 15 degrees. Why did you not suggest all guests bring a warm winter jacket, as they would be required to stand outside in the freezing cold for 20-30 minutes?When we entered the hotel for the party, the venue was a logistical nightmare. There were no easily visible signs pointing us where to go, mobs of people everywhere, and no staff members to help regulate traffic and answer questions. Why was there such little direction for patrons? Why was is that you did not have knowledgeable personnel or large signs to help party goers?The alcoholic drinks were absolutely unacceptable. The drinks were made by inexperienced bartenders (one had to ask me what was in the drink I ordered), made with watered down ingredients, and were served in extremely small plastic ""shooter"" cups that were barely filled 3/4 of the way. Why were drinks not made a priority for your staff? Why did we need to wait in line for 5-10 minutes EACH TIME we wanted a drink? Why was there a lack of mixers for cocktails (no orange juice at a $150/ticket event???)?The ""lavish pasta dinner buffet"", as described by the event flyer, was abysmal. The food immediately gave our group stomachaches, and was dry, overcooked, and quite frankly, inedible. Why was more attention not paid towards the food? Why were there not more food stations available? Is cold rigatoni heated by a lamp truly considered ""lavish pasta"" by your organization?The bathrooms were a nightmare. The lines wrapped around the outside of the bathroom, various stalls ran out of toilet paper, there were no attendants, and I witnessed two separate physical fights break out due to the lack of staff around and in the restroom. Why was there no attendant in the bathroom to ensure that women had enough utilities to feel fresh and happy throughout the night? Why was the safety of the patrons not put first and foremost??The final occurrence that made me regret my decision to spend New Year's Eve at the Hard Rock is the fact that the promotional team CLEARLY OVERSOLD tickets for this event and the DJ quite literally forced patrons in the main dance room at 11:00 to leave the room or else the party would be shut down. The amount of people in the room exceeded the fire code, and somehow this was made to be OUR fault, and the music was continuously interrupted so the manager could THREATEN us to go downstairs or the party would be shut down. It was completely absurd. The language and tone he used was absolutely unacceptable for party goers who paid a whopping $150 to be present at this understaffed, poorly thought-out event. Why were the rooms not more appropriately monitored so there would not be a problem with the fire code? Why was this addressed so harshly and despicably by the event coordinator??At 12:09, a mere NINE MINUTES after celebrating a new year beginning, the music was shut off, bars were closed, and patrons were forced out of the upstairs rooms and corralled downstairs. We then discovered that once we went downstairs to the other party (we were promised that the event continued until 2:00 am), we would not be permitted to return upstairs to retrieve our coats. This caused complete pandemonium. Individuals began chanting angrily, protesting against these ridiculous restrictions, and staff members were completely overwhelmed. Why not plan for a better system in place for patrons to get their coats, many of which are expensive and personal? Why force patrons to leave the most exciting of the rooms less than ten minutes after midnight, after the promotional flyer promised a ""4.5 hour premium package""?????Patrons were furious, myself included. I left angry, confused, and wholeheartedly regretting my decision to buy a ridiculously overpriced $150 ticket to the most over hyped and disappointing New Year's party event I had ever attended. We ended up using points to go stay at the Marriott down the road. BEWARE!!!!",nan,nan,ta_s624
trip_advisor,"We had 3 rooms at the Hard Rock; 2 platinum doubles and 1standard king. Though the platinum doubles are advertised having 500 square feet which is true the configuration of the room has about half that in usable space. This is due to the fact that there is hallway behind the living area, and the bathroom is like another hallway. The king was back in the corner of the hotel. The cool factor is a plus and is evident throughout the building. Should I return I would book a room in the Tower and go for a room with a view in lieu of a bigger room. The staff was cordial and made good on our TravelZoo voucher for drinks after we called TravelZoo to complain.",nan,nan,ta_s625
trip_advisor,"Stayed at the Hard Rock Hotel Chicago during my recent visit (Nov. 13-15) and enjoyed it very much. My flight out of California was delayed several times which delayed my check in for the day, but it was still a breeze to check in when I finally got there. Room was large & the bed was comfortable, pillows were super fluffy and amazing as well (especially after a long day of traveling). Bathroom was decently sized as well! TV has good channels and the room came with complimentary wifi (which I believe is only available complimentary if you book directly through their website, but I could be wrong)Housekeeping did a good job making sure the room was clean & restocked the following day. LOCATION LOCATION LOCATION!!! Couldn't have asked for a better location, right by Millennium Park & right down the street from Magnificent Mile where you can go shop your heart out (which I did). I should have stopped by Millennium Park as it was the same weekend that the outdoor ice skating rink opened up but because I've been there before, it wasn't first on my to-do list, I quickly regretted that the moment I found out that it was the first weekend the ice rink was open! Oh well, I will be making a stop there the next time I'm in Chicago (next month). Anyway, sidetracked for a second, there are also of plenty of good eats within the area, and if it's too cold & you'd prefer to order some delivery food, some places within the area can deliver to your room & the hotel allows this, which is awesome. They do also provide room service, but didn't take advantage of it.My last evening there, I did stop and have dinner at Chuck's: A Kerry Simon Kitchen, which was AMAZING. I'm almost glad it wasn't a Hard Rock Cafe! The food was delicious and the service (Kerianne took care of us, I did also write a review for this restaurant and mentioned her as well, so go and read my review on the food & service!) was even better. Couldn't have asked for a better last evening at my stay here. I know staying on Michigan Ave. is a little expensive, however, I did get this room on a KILLER DEAL!! So that's definitely a PLUS. Would stay here if the chance arises & the price point is right!Enjoy.",nan,nan,ta_s626
trip_advisor,"This hotel is centrally located in Chicago - the loop and the magnificent mile are all within walking distance of the hotel is also extremely close to quite a few parks and opposite the hotel is in very handy bus station that will take you to most parts of ChicagoThe staff are extremely friendly and the hotel is very clean, The rooms are of average size for a hotel but if you ask to stay in the tower upon checking in and make a donation you get to stay on the higher floors.The higher floors mean you get a bit more wind noise, the plus side is though that you get spectacular views of Chicago which ever side of the hotel your room happens to be on.The restaurant in the hotel is also really good for breakfast and evening meal as the proportions are quite normal for British people because usually I find USA portions a little bit large.The concierge in this hotel is amazing they don't mind taking a couple of minutes to explain things to do in the best way to get there.Nothing bad against the hotel but if you do go in January February expected to be extremely cold.",nan,nan,ta_s627

It has a modern minimalistic design, however it is an older hotel and the wear is visible. All hotel staff were welcoming, friendly and eager to help. Checking was really fast, I asked for a quiet room and they were able to accommodate me. Although I booked the room through Hotwire secret rate, I got a room on the 23rd floor with a view. The rooms are average size, there are 4 star hotels in the area with smaller rooms. It has the best location, right in the center of downtown with plenty of good restaurants and bars. It is also 5 min away from magnificent mile and if you want to do any shopping.I Wouldn't recommend it for a business trip.",nan,nan,ta_s628
trip_advisor,I stayed here 3 nights. I thought the corner room King was nice. The two queens I saw looked like any other room in a average hotel. The lobby was sparse and small. I thought the employees were helpful and friendly. . Breakfast restaurant was understaffed and very slow. I ate there once and the next two mornings went across the street to the Bagel shop. The internet was slow and didn't seem to work that great on the 13th floor. This is in the Carbide building which is very beautiful from the outside but not much on the inside. It is short walking distance to several great restaurants and shops (Magnificent Mile). The beds were comfortable but the temperature in the room was difficult to get right. I did not like the TV it was very slow and constantly had images referring.,nan,nan,ta_s629

trip_advisor,"Spent two nights recently to watch the US/NZ rugby match at Soldier Field. The hotel is very conveniently located to many cultural and nightlife spots in the city. It was a very short walk (4 blocks maybe) from the blue line train to the hotel which saved a considerable amount on transportation. The concierge gave excellent advice on restaurants and bars as well as nearby touristy attractions. The rooms were clean, housekeeping was attentive. We were missing a television remote and maintenance replaced it within minutes. All downtown hotels are pricey, but I would choose this again if I wanted to be downtown.",nan,nan,ta_s631
trip_advisor,"I was staying at the hotel to babysit the infant of one of the attendants standing up for a wedding hosted at the hotel. Desk staff, check in and location were great, loved the room but I was pretty much a captive in it with a young infant. I called room service 3 times over the course of about 90 minutes trying to order something for me and the baby. Each time the call was answered by Guest Services who said my call to In-Room Dining would be returned shortly. My calls were never returned. Clearly the hotel was under-staffed and I wish they'd just stepped up to the plate and said ""it's not gonna happen"" and told me (from out of town) where to call for pizza or something.",nan,nan,ta_s632
trip_advisor,"I've never felt like a hotel was out to take my money more than this hotel. From the miscommunication and inconsistent pricing of the group rate vs the extra nights we stayed, to the motion-sensor mini-bar (make sure you check your bill if you store your own stuff in the small mini-fridge ... you move a Miller Lite, and you're auto-charged even if you didn't remove it from the fridge!) to the emails about getting upgrades, the Hard Rock Hotel seemed to want my money more than to make my stay really rock. The communication was awful. Mostly, the bride was so disappointed with the lack of communication & the royal screw ups! The service in Chuck's, the restaurant at the lobby, was awful -- so slow, so miserable. The bathrooms are dark and make it hard to prep for a wedding -- unless you want to look like Courtney Love's bad years. Hard Rock needs to clean up its act in order to be a really great place -- like it has the potential to be. There are good parts about the hotel -- it's in a beautiful and historic building. Each floor is dedicated to a rock star. You can rent a Fender and take lessons from a video played on an in-room TV channel. The pillows and mattresses are super comfy. But if you book a room, prepare to be asked a week before your trip if you want to upgrade to an even better room for $20 more a night (appx.). Could be worth it, but I was so sick of their inconsistencies when I booked, that the last thing I wanted to do was to give them more of my cash.",nan,nan,ta_s633
trip_advisor,"My wife and I just spent 3 nights here. It was partially business / partially a tacked-on vacation day. The hotel itself is in a very nice, historic art deco building...The Carbon and Carbide Building. It's at a good location on Michigan and Wacker, right near the river. It's an incredibly easy walk to the Magnificent Mile, very close to Millenium Park (You can be at Cloud Gate in less than 10 minutes), close to the ""theater district"", etc. When you walk into the lobby, you are greated by fairly loud rock music throughout. I like rock, but I have to admit, when I got off the elevator at 7am and stepped into loud Pat Benetar, it was a bit abrupt. We stayed in a Tower room...I highly recommend the slight upgrade. The views are spectacular. The room itself was of modest size. We had two queen beds. The bathroom is a shower only, but it was a large shower, at least. The beds were comfortable. I also appreciated that the window had both a blackout curtain and translucent blinds that pulled down...so if you didn't want to be plunged into complete darkness just to get privacy, you could do it. We never used the blackouts, but enjoyed the city lights coming through the blinds...and in the morning, gentle sunlight.We got good service at the concierge desk and the front desk (and bell desk) were friendly and helpful. Just the right balance of friendly without being overbearing. The staff is fairly young, but they were well trained and did a good job.My only complaint was with housekeeping. The first day there, I had some conference calls, so couldn't let housekeeping come up until early afternoon. When I returned to the room in the evening, the beds were made and the towels on the floor picked up. But the towels were not replaced, nor was the nearly used up soap. The next day, we got a few new towels, but never got any new shampoo, soap, etc. One day, they forgot a new floormat. They didn't give us new plastic bags for the ice bucket. Very little straightening of the room occured. I'm not a very needy traveler, and I never complained...but I wasn't entirely satisfied.Other than this, we did enjoy ourselves, and on balance, I'd stay here again. It's expensive, but it was still less than many of the nearby hotels, and I thought the historic nature of the building was also an added bonus...as my wife and I are art and architecture afficionados.",nan,nan,ta_s634
trip_advisor,"Your money can be better spent at another Chicago Inner Loop hotel. I've been to Chicago Inner Loop for business several times and have stayed at several other hotels. This trip, all other hotels were booked and Hard Rock was the only available hotel. So the poor service started by the kid at front desk at check-in. He was very inexperienced and after traveling from across country, all you want to do is get your key, have some questions answered and get to your room. Not only was it difficult to hear him due to the loud music blasting at the front office from the bar (which is to be expected since, after all, this is the Hard Rock), but he insisted on practically whispering. There are no bellboys to help with luggage. And the room, although large and roomy, had a bathroom where the tiles were practically coming off the floor, the makeup mirror was falling off the wall, and the whole vanity was loose and moveable along with the plumbing. The building is very old, and the place is just unimpressive. But what's funny is that three AM's in a row I tried going to the hotel restaurant at 7 AM before heading out and each time waited to be sat. Although there were two people each AM eating, there was no sign of a host or a waiter. Each AM I gave it a 2 to 3 minute chance waiting there but each time I eventually left. When I ordered room service one night due to a late night working, the food came up in a timely fashion, but the meal plate was not covered. So, who knows who breathed on it, sneezed on it, or what may have gotten onto it on its way up the elevator. Pretty ghetto as far as I'm concerned. And as for price? Very similar to the other places I've stayed around town. The crowd that stays at this hotel is pretty rude, too. Definitely not geared to a business clientele as each night there were people partying and yelling thru the halls of my floor. And as for the gym downstairs, don't believe the smoke and mirrors of their website picture. The gym is very small and not impressive, either. You're better off getting a pass to LA Fitness a block away or LifeFitness that is 2 blocks away (that also has a basketball court). And as for wifi in the room? Don't bother paying for your iPhone. The wifi is not compatible to iPhones and although I paid a fortune to have my laptop and iPhone connected, I had to keep turning off the wifi on my iPhone because it was just not working. In any event, your money is better spent elsewhere. Hope this helps...",nan,nan,ta_s635
trip_advisor,"I wanted to surprise a friend for his birthday and booked a suite at the Hard Rock Hotel Chicago. It was the first time either of us stated at the hotel.LOCATION: The hotel is ideally situated on Michigan Avenue between all the big shopping, The Loop, and many ""L"" stations and bus stops. It's super easy to get around from the Hard Rock.CHECK-IN: I have been traveling for more than 45 years and I have NEVER had a check-in so quick as the one at the Hard Rock. Literally, less than two minutes at the desk and we were on our way to the room. When we arrived at approximately 3:45 pm, there was no line at the desk. Thirty minutes later as we were on our way out to enjoy the city, I noticed a line had begun to form, though. It did appear that everyone was being processed quickly. THE ROOM: I elected to upgrade us to a Tower Suite. Booking through the Hard Rock Chicago's website can give you the opportunity to take advantage of discounts and upgrades that booking on third-party websites does not. When we got to the room, I was a little disappointed. The room seemed almost devoid of decor and the furnishings were rather worn. The carpets had seen better days and should be replaced. There was a light grey sectional sofa in the room that looked like it was ordered from an office furniture and it had a number of unfortunate stains on it. The room had a pool table, which is sort of cool; but, it, too, had seen better days. The bathroom was huge and had really nice fixtures including a shower the size of which could host a catered party. However, the linens were very low quality. My friend said the bed was very comfortable (since there was only a king bed in the room and seeing as it was his birthday, he got the bed and I slept on the couch). THE VIEW: Our room was on the 15th floor and faced south with a fantastic view from the living room and the bathroom (there was a gigantic picture window over the soaker bathtub). Had I not been so tired from a day of travel and walking through Chicago, I would have probably stayed up into the wee hours just watching out the windows.VALUE: The room for one night was a little more than $300 -- easily more than I've ever paid for a room for a personal trip. Even being a suite, I'm not sure I felt like we got as much bang for the buck as I would have thought. I felt like we were in a big, blank room. The suites come with free Wi-Fi in the room, which was a bonus.ODDITY: The odd thing I found disappointing was a lack of music at the Hard Rock Hotel. The room had one standard iPod dock in the bedroom and no other music at all in the room. I figured we'd have some sort of in-room music channels, etc. The decor was bland and definitely didn't give you a ""living like a rock star"" feel. SUMMARY: Aside from stained, worn furnishings and cheap linens, there was nothing really wrong with the Hard Rock Hotel Chicago. But there wasn't anything overwhelmingly right with it, either. If I got an outstanding deal on a room, I'd probably consider staying there again, but it will not be my first choice of properties in Chicago.",nan,nan,ta_s636
trip_advisor,"I go back to Fats Domino and Elvis. Music brings the generations together just as baseball has been credited with doing here in America. No better place than the Hard Rock where floors are dedicated to rock stars and music is always playing in the lobby. The club was rocking as well. The staff was terrific. We were given an upgrade, the concierge helped with local travel and bags were stowed after a late check out. We always had the feeling that the staff would do whatever they could forus. The room was on a high floor which was delightful and most importantly, clean, roomy and well stocked with morning coffee, towels and extra drinks and snacks (at a cost).I try to keep a lid on hotel prices but with this hotel, in the center of everything, there is great value; the hotel is close to the station coming from the airport/other city lines. The Art Institute is down the street as was the Cloud Gate sculpture that you must see. Also,the well knownboat tours leave from the closest point to the river from the hotel.It is all there for you. Get to know your children, grandchildren, mothers and fathers, aunts and uncles, even your brothers and sisters by starting with ""so who is your favorite artist""? That artist may just have floor 33 dedicated to him - Bono!",nan,nan,ta_s637
trip_advisor,"great location and fast elevators. ping pong table. beds were very comfortable. The room was like an aging rock star, well passed it's prime. The laminate was coming off the dresser/desk. A large picture was missing, the hanging brackets were there. The bathroom sink was wobbly and the faucet spun around loosely. The phone wasn't plugged in and the power cord was missing. I went to the front desk twice to get the room fixed and nothing happened. I feel I was misled by your website and priceline. fool me once....",nan,nan,ta_s638
trip_advisor,"This was a perfect hotel for our son's wedding group. Great location. Everyone from out of town could walk to the city's attractions - parks museums, boat trips. They raved about how easy it all was. The staff was outstanding - planning, execution of the events, rooms. Couldn't have asked for anything better. Didn't know much about them to begin with other than they had occupied the old Union Carbide building. Now, can't say enough about them. A well rounded experience.",nan,nan,ta_s639
trip_advisor,I would not normally look at this hotel but it was a busy weekend with the Chicago Marathon and it was the best combination for price and location. What a pleasant surprise that it was perfect! Location couldn't be better. Great shopping and restaurants are all walkable! Saved a lot of $ with no cabs. It was surprisingly quiet and the service was perfect. Room was clean and comfortable. A few special requests for more towels and more in-room coffees were fulfilled quickly. Nightlife in the bar was fun with post wedding party dancing. Close enough to the finish of the marathon as well. Nice surprise!,nan,nan,ta_s640
trip_advisor,"First I will start out by saying the service at front desk is amazing. My issue is more with the rooms themselves. Bought a groupon and also belong to hard rock VIP club so I expected a bit of an upgraded room (paid for 2queens with city views). Room was very small, sink was broken, picture missing off wall with hooks still attached and bathroom door wouldn't latch or close. Mentioned to staff who happily moved us to a huge corner room (same style with 2 queens) and view is great however- woke this morning at 7:30am to jackhammers and pounding on building directly next door. I realize the construction is not the HR problem but even with windows closed and tv on, it's so loud and disturbing. Better insulation or warning would've been nice. Even on Sat am, pounding continues. Have stayed in Chicago many times at other hotels...Palmer Hilton is where I'll be going back. Really disappointed with the hard rock...sad because I expected to be blown away. Usually their properties are awesome but even with the amazing service, not sure unless they do major remodel, I'd come back.",nan,nan,ta_s641
trip_advisor,"Stayed the night in one of the suites with the groom and a few of the groomsmen. My friend was having his wedding there. Room was nice, I guess I has higher expectations for a suite, floor seemed a little worn. It did include a pool table which was cool. Asked the front desk to bring us a fridge which they did, but the fridge did not work. Didn't bother asking for another fridge. Staff was friendly and prompt with our requests. It was a hectic weekend and the staff helped keep things running as smooth as possible. We had a nice view from the room and a great time. The wedding venue at the Hard Rock was great! Great location in downtown Chicago.",nan,nan,ta_s642
trip_advisor,"Stayed here for a couple of nights en-route to Indianapolis.Researched many hotels on line and decided that this was the perfect option as a treat for our teenage son who was travelling with us.Got a fabulous deal on the room and have to say we were not disapointed in our choice.The hotel is located in a beautiful historic building in a perfect location for exploring all Chicago has to offer being just a couple of minutes walk from the river,the Loop and of course the shopping on The Magnificent Mile.Rooms were spacious,well appointed,spotlessly clean and suprisingly quiet.Staff were exceptionally friendly and service first rate.Would definitely recommend and would love to visit again.",nan,nan,ta_s643

trip_advisor,"Had my flight(s) canceled on Friday, could only get out at 2am. Decided to stay in town and thought the Hard Rock might be a good place to stay.Checked in, room keys didn't work. Went back down and had keys reprogrammed. Got into the room and it was a big disappointment.Bathroom countertop had ""stuff"" on it, coffee cups were dusty, spilled/dried coffee on the remaining k-cups, room just felt dirty.Called front desk and they gave is another room, which was much cleaner.Service was OK. One thing I didn't know until I went to the bar is there is no live music at the hotel.... Only a DJ in the bar at night. That was a real surprise, would have thought the hard rock hotel would have a band at night. Location is OK but most live music appears to he across the river. If you're into shopping the magic mile the location is OK.Would I go back? There are many hotels in the price range downtown, would look for another place next time....",nan,nan,ta_s645
trip_advisor,This hotel has a great location and isn't too badly priced for the area. We were here for two nights/three days. We did valet parking with the room and didn't need our vehicle until we went home due to the fact that everything was within walking distance. The hotel hallways are a little dark and seem like they need more light but it might just be an after effect of the building the hotel is in. We would stay here again when visiting Chicago.,nan,nan,ta_s646
trip_advisor,"I stayed here on the Tina Turner floor, as we called it, during a business conference. The hotel is in a good location for wandering the river front or checking out the Magnificent Mile; an easy walk (in nice weather) to the parks and a quick cab or bus ride away from other attractions like Navy Pier, Shedd Aquarium, Wrigley Field, etc.The room was furnished and decorated in a pleasing, modern style with comfortable furnishings. We had no problems with the staff, room service, or any other amenities. A bit pricey, as I recall, but I would stay there again!",nan,nan,ta_s647
trip_advisor,"We had a pair of rooms over the weekend, and had an enjoyable time. The hotel was nice, the service was really good, and the price was quite reasonable given the prices in the area. Parts of our room were a bit dated, the remote control for the TV seemed to work only with some convincing, and the air conditioning was far from forceful, but there was nothing that was a huge deal. Room sizes were a bit on the smallish size, but definitely not EU sized. The service was very friendly, and the vibe in the hotel was energetic and lively. I didn't get a chance to try out room service, but the menu looked decent. I would definitely return, although I would check out my other options.

trip_advisor,"Got a great rate from third party website for the time that we were traveling. We got to the hotel earlier that check in time but they were able to check us in, which was great because we could freshen up before going out to town. The housekeeping crew was great, they lined up our personal bath products in a neat row and tidied up the beds, but what made it really special was the fact that they put my son's stuffed animal in the middle of the bed along with my son's personal blankie...that totally made him so happy :)I was curious about the late check out policy, so I called the front desk, and was surprised to be greeted with Mrs. .... (last name) instead of the generic greeting. The front desk gave me complimentary check out, which we didn't end up needing but it was appreciated.After check out, they held our luggage too so we could go around town until it was time to go. Very satisfied and definitely recommended.",nan,nan,ta_s649
trip_advisor,"A really nice hotel. Despite the ""Hard Rock"" name, there is not rock music blaring anywhere in the hotel. Exterior and elevator lobby are nicely understated art deco. Rooms are spacious and modern. Nice touches everywhere. Two examples: Individual pull-down reading lights on both sides of the bed so that the non-reading partner is not disturbed. A separate vanity area with a back-lit makeup mirror. Staff are friendly, helpful, and knowledgeable. The location on Michigan Ave., just two blocks south of the Chicago River (the beginning of the Magnificent Mile) is a great. It's also two blocks from Millennium Park and one of the best breakfasts (Wildberry on E. Randolph). Not inexpensive, but a really fair price given it's location and amenities. Note that actual entrance is on E. Wacker Pl. (around the corner) even though it lists a Michigan Ave. address.",nan,nan,ta_s650
trip_advisor,"This was a ""splurge"" stay for us, trip from Ontario to Louisiana stopping in Chicago and Nashville along the way. We had looked online for hotels before we left and had selected a few pet friendly hotels as options. Based on past experiences , the ""pet friendly"" rooms are the dingy, back corner, rarely serviced rooms in need of repair. This was the opposite, downright amazing! We felt like guests of honor, and so did our dog. Everyone was very friendly throughout the hotel. The concierge let us know where to walk the dog (those stairs down to the riverside 5-6 times /day are a workout!!) very pleased to have the park & stay package as an option",nan,nan,ta_s651
trip_advisor,"A very nice stay. All the staff were especially friendly. They were very knowledgable of where to go, how to get there and what to expect. All was wonderful BUT watch your bill we were billed for 5 drinks from the refrig. bar in the room that we did not have. In fact we discussed the bar use with staff who came to our room at our request as we had touched a bottle while putting a sandwich in and then read the fine print that said, motion sensitive you may be billed. We were assured we would NOT be billed, but we were. Others in our party were also including one whose room refrigerator was empty and remained empty throughout there 4 day stay.",nan,nan,ta_s652
trip_advisor,"If you are a music fan like I am, all genres, you will appreciate this hotel the minute you walk in the door, walk the red carpet and here the music playing. The decor is modern and luxurious, but with a fun, trendy, rock edge!Each floor is themed after a music legend and you'll know who as soon as you exit the elevator, to your right you'll see a huge mural representing the icon and to your right some memorabilia from the artist...I was on the Rolling Stones floor!Once you enter your room you'll see a luxurious bed and mirror with a quote from your music legend etched in the mirror along with other music-inspired artwork. I found the room clean, spacious and with adequate closet space, I had a fun city view. It's very convenient to everything right off of Michigan avenue, there's even a Walgreens next store.I loved the Angels & Kings bar on Friday night, friendly hostesses and great mixture of music from all genres, I had in-room breakfast that was timely and delicious and before my flight the 2nd day, I had drinks and appetizers at Chuck's both were excellent.

This is simply fantastic, great for exploring the city too, steps from shops, the canal and Chicago site seeing/trails and trains.",nan,nan,ta_s653
trip_advisor,"We've stayed in a handful of different hotels around Michigan Ave over the years. We used to love the old Wyndham before it got bought out and prices went up/service down. Decided to book a Labor Day weekend in Chicago and the Hard Rock Hotel was one of, if not the best, priced hotels in the area, so we thought we'd give it a shot.Really liked the place. Service is excellent, the rooms are amazing for a hotel of this price/location/age. We expected tiny rooms, but they are a very nice size, and well appointed and maintained. We got to the hotel at 9:30AM after taking an early train, and our room was ready for us, so we were able to unpack immediately. I don't think I've ever arrived at a hotel that early and had the room ready.Overall, we really liked HRH, and it's now at the top of our list to stay in the area.",nan,nan,ta_s654
trip_advisor,"The Hard Rock Hotel is the historic art-deco Carbide and Carbon Building-- a dark beauty of 1920s Chicago architecture. Stay for that reason alone. As you would expect, rooms are appointed with portraits of rock gods loosely based on a theme (mine had both Robert Plant and Joan Jett?) and the overall feel is modern and minimalist. Staff is helpful and friendly. A special thanks to Sheila the concierge for steering me to Lou Malnati's for dinner. Morning showers were hot. I was worried about cold water as some have mentioned in their reviews, but it was not a problem during my stay. Location is superb (close to trains and major attractions) and the atmosphere is swank-- a hipster heaven in the heart of the Loop.",nan,nan,ta_s655
trip_advisor,"The HRH in Chicago is a great place to stay, if you're there for a nightlife visit. The bar downstairs seems to always have live music and is always busy so what ever time you get in from your Chicago adventures, you can have a last drink before bed.The rooms are big and spacious and up to date. In fact the whole hotel is in great condition with a good style as well as keeping a hint of its history. The memorabilia on the walls is like most Hard Rock Cafe's but less of it and the cool merch shop is there to remind you that its a brand first and foremost.The staff are all friendly and cool, ties undone, jeans and shirt for the doormen. Its deliberate, to try and give that sort of casual vibe, as though a suit is too stuffy but you're cool enough to not get worked up over it. Its as much a uniform as anything but hey, its a Hard Rock hotel not the Four Seasons.Its in a great location to get around and see stuff and the building itself is impressive. Plenty of places to eat and drink near by, all within walking distance and so I'd highly recommend it as a place to 'crash' which is kind of the attitude they are sort of trying to make you think they're going for.Downsides, no free wifi but hey what else is new in the US.Didn't get to try the restaurant either so can't comment",nan,nan,ta_s656
trip_advisor,"Room was comfortable, clean, and bright. The furniture was nice and modern, and the bed was very comfortable. The washroom was clean as well, albeit the sink/counter was a little small. The only negative thing was that the mini-fridge was charged by the weight removed from it. If you so much as moved a drink around, you could be charged automatically. Too bad, because the hotel is literally right next to a Walgreens where you can pick up snacks and whatnot. Location is the best feature of this hotel. It's right on Michigan Ave- Millennium park is across the street, Magnificent Mile is across the bridge, and there are several train stations close by. And as previously mentioned, there is a Walgreens right next to the hotel. No free wifi unless you book directly through the hotel itself. Not a huge complaint though, because the hotel is close to several Starbucks. However, you are free to use the business centre that provides internet access and printing.",nan,nan,ta_s657

The hotel services were all great - the business center had free printing, and the dry cleaning service was very good. The only big disappointment was that the wifi was unexpectedly expensive. The location is convenient if you are going to be downtown, or have pre-arranged transportation. A number of good restaurants within a block, and the Chicago river is close by.",nan,nan,ta_s658

The ""night club"" was awful and the drinks are very acidic.",nan,nan,ta_s659
trip_advisor,"The hotel is ok, rooms are nothing to brag about but bed was comfortable which is very important. Unfortunately our room faced a construction so when we were in the room the background noise wasn't nice. There is a lobby bar so if you like that scene they had live music every evening. Location is great, right near the Millenial Park... We actually only took a cab once later at night, other than that we did the whole tourist trip walking. The other bummer is that wifi is only free in common areas, in room there is a daily fee...Watch out when you check out since we had a mini bar charge that did not apply (it has sensors so you can easily get charged for something by mistake).",nan,nan,ta_s660

When we called the front desk to complain, we were basically told it would eventually get quiet. Yea, it did about 5am but only for a few. I'm not sure I'd stay here again despite the great deal we got on Expedia. I didn't find the hotel staff very friendly or over accommodating either. I asked the concierge about a couple restaurants his answer was to hand me a map and say find what you need on there.",nan,nan,ta_s661

The hotel is in a fabulous art deco building and our room was spacious. It was a bit noisy, being beside the elevator and there was also a lot of early morning construction going on nearby. There was no breakfast included but the major negative is that there was no free wifi. It was free in the lobby but there was a charge in the room. These days I think nearly every hotel offers free wifi so this seemed to be an unnecessary money-grabbing ploy.

It was clean, bright, and spectacular view of the river, Trump Tower, Allerton Hotel ( lighted at night ), Marina Towers, and more. Room was made up at our convenience. We did not have much contact with the front desk, but they were cordial when we checked in and out. One issue was the toilet which did not always flush unless you held down the handle, but the bed and pillows were very comfortable. The bar service downstairs was very good.

The hotel itself is nice enough but very dark and a bit dismal and missing something. We stayed in August 2013, a room on the 23rd floor. The room wasn't any better than most travel lodges etc, an additional print in most areas of a rock star, we had Sting and John Lennon. It wasn't over the top expensive but it was not to cheap either. Don't know what we expected from The Hard Rock Chicago, but it didn't feel special to us for our 4 night stay their last year. However I am not knocking it either as it just lacked 'that something special!'",nan,nan,ta_s669

We knew of people staying on 2 other floors who also had cold showers -Hook on the back of the bathroom door was missing.,nan,nan,ta_s670
trip_advisor,Problem with door was stated from initial visit check-in and was never fixed. Water in room was cold. Called and complained but was never fixed. Upon exit staff was very unfriendly and we called for a yellow taxi an hour before. When they called us to come down from our room we came outside to the doorman escorting someone into our cab and the bellman said they were there first even though we called the company and the cab driver confirmed it was our reservation. We watched the bellman take a tip from the person he escorted into the cab and when he was asked for his name he ignored us and went inside. My wife and I travel and stay in hotels all across the nation as we are consultants. We have stayed in many Hard Rock Hotels and never had these problems. The only reason we came to this location is because we had VIP reservations for the Plaboy NYE Party.

The very corner room with awful, let me rephrase, NO view. Ridiculous. Dirty floor. Dirty hallways smelling of urine mixed with some cover-up scent. Bathroom faucet was about to fall off, I was so nervous to use it. Bathroom was outdated and not clean, and, upon walking in, the stench of sewage permeated our noses...as if someone had just used it before we checked in. Disgusting. Shower was COLD and the mini bar was WARM. Sheet was ripped. House keeping was supposed to be back at 9:30 and our room wasn't even touched when we returned at 1...got extra towels from the cart instead. Oh, and extra towels? One had nasty remnants of a big blood stain...Seriously? Gross. Also...got charged 6 internet connection fees totaling close to $90. So much more to be said, but I ranted enough. Never have I given a bad review...so you know it was awful. Even if we were given a credit to stay here again, no way in heck we would. Don't stay here!!!!",nan,nan,ta_s672

Hallways were filthy ! Floors dirty, entire hotel reeked of cigarette smoke although it claims ""No Smoking"" , bathroom faucet was about to fall off vanity. View WAS HORRIBLE ! Overlooking roof top of air conditioning units and smoke stacks ! Sadly we paid ""Extra"" for so called ""City View"". Would not refer will not be back ! Was never able to speak to management.",nan,nan,ta_s673
trip_advisor,"Stayed here with my 7 year old son. We chose this place because of price break for after holidays and my sin was hyped about anything Hard Rock! Friendly staff upon check in. House keeping not overly attentive to detail. Same dirty glass in hallway since we've checked in and this is night 2!! Room is ok. Do not pick this hotel if you like supportive furniture!! It is like a mix of old hotel feel meets modern furniture. Cool but not comfy or ergonomically correct! Location decent -In between shopping on Michigan, shopping on State Street, Millennium Park and museums. We will not stay again, but it still rates average compared to other places I've stayed.",nan,nan,ta_s674
trip_advisor,"I don't know where to start because there was so much wrong with our stay here! The in-room WiFi was horribly slow and cost $18.50. We had to call their InnFlux 800 # in order to get connected and they had a hard time getting it to work. The hotel billed us for each time the customer support rep tried to connect us, so our internet bill was $148. My husband thought he had it corrected with the front desk through a revised invoice, but we were billed the $148 anyway. Then they didn't invoice us for the outrageously-priced $60 valet parking service. So we had to tell them about that.The bed was horribly hard and the temperature control in the room didn't work so we were hot all evening and they could not get it fixed. Our drapes were all frayed and torn on the edges.The TV remote didn't work right.The door to the room would not shut properly unless you really leaned on it. Loud and obnoxious music was playing almost constantly in the lobby.The elevators were horribly slow.The maids started knocking on doors at 8 am Sunday morning trying to find rooms that they could start cleaning.I'm certain that I've forgotten something!!",nan,nan,ta_s675
trip_advisor,"Stayed in a platinum king room on the fourteenth floor (Elton John floor). Bought the stay on Groupon and it was so worth it! This was a surprise birthday trip for my girlfriend and I went ahead a threw in a proposal just to make it really special! I had been in contact with the concierge, Josh, before I traveled to set up some things for the night and he came through. The hotel is immaculate, full of history, and in a perfect location on Michigan Avenue, right between the shopping and Millennium Park. I took advantage of the hotel's Picks program which allows you to jam on a Fender guitar in your room for free. Very nice! Make sure you have dinner at Chuck's in the hotel. It's been reimagined by Iron Chef Kerry Simon and the pork chop and mashed potatoes were the best I'd ever had. My whole experience was perfect!",nan,nan,ta_s676
trip_advisor,"I was a little nervous when I read some of the reviews. They talked about the noise and dirty bathrooms etc. However, I must say that my experience was anything but negative. We stayed on the 17th floor. The room was right by the employee office and the ice machine. I was a little nervous about that, even though I packed ear plugs. However, I did not want to change the room, as we had a great view of the Michigan Avenue and the Cloud Gate (""Bean""). I did not hear any noises, but I did have my earplugs in. The room itself is very spacious, TV is great. The bathroom was big and clean. Yes, there were some cosmetic issues (a missing hook on one of the curtains, one of the light bulbs didn't work), but who doesn't have those? The staff at the reception, concierge and cleaning were very friendly. Location of the hotel is unbeatable. Everything is withing walking distance, Millennium Park is about a 5 minute walk. I would definitely want to stay here again!",nan,nan,ta_s677
trip_advisor,"We stayed two weeks ago for Thanksgiving and we had the most comfortable stay at Hard Rock in Chicago. I am a big fan of all Hard Rock Hotels Cafes and Casinos, we couldn't be more satisfied with the service from all that work at this hotel. The people are always willing to give 200% to make your stay the best. The rooms are spacious, clean and fun with all the memorabilia. The food is wonderful if you want to stay in and have a bite at Chuck's or if you decide to go to Angel's and Kings. Angels and Kings always have a live band rockn or you may have their wonderful breakfast in the morning. We were treated with the upmost fantabulous service. To be staying right on the magnificent mile has been the best experience ever for my family, the train station is not far at all and of course walking to the shopping area or to see a play was so close to everything. We would reccommend to all and we will definetely be back. Pam from Indiana",nan,nan,ta_s678
trip_advisor,"I stayed at the Hard Rock Chicago in October 2013. The hotel is modern and funky. Rock themes on each floor and in your room. I was on the 4th floor in a standard room. The view was of the Walgreens across the street. Nothing too exciting. Bed was comfortable and the bath products are exceptional. I was traveling for work so my company picked up the tab. If this would have been on my nickel, I would have said it was not worth it. There was no bottled water in the room and the two attached restaurants were very expensive. If I have to travel again for work, I would probably try a different hotel just to mix it up.",nan,nan,ta_s679
trip_advisor,"Superbly attentive staff, cool, friendly attitude! We were upgraded before they even knew we were reward members, sent a comp bottle of wine to the room when we told the bell boy that we were on our anniversary, and also a couple of days later a bucket with beers and popcorn (Garretts... do not leave Chicago without getting some). Room could use a bit more lightning and a lot more decor, but it was huge and with great views. Overall a great experience, would definitely go back. Oh and the location is simply perfect.",nan,nan,ta_s680
trip_advisor,"The Hard Rock Hotel's location is perfect for anyone wanting to walk the great city of Chicago! We have stayed all over the downtown area and I have to admit that we will remember this stay as one of our best. We had won a two-night stay at a fundraiser in Kalamazoo, Michigan and called into see if we could upgrade to a Tower Suite. For a reasonable fee, we were able to upgrade and the tower suites deliver a commanding view of the city. We had an east facing (like the whole east half of the tower) where we could easily see north all the way up Michigan Avenue to the Hancock Building, below us was the Chicago River, to the South, Grant Park, Millennium Plaza, Art Institute were in clear view, to our Southwest, we could see the Willis (Sears) Tower and Theater District. You can easily walk into the best shopping on Michigan Avenue as the hotel is on Michigan Avenue! The museums are a two mile walk to Field or Shedd or Adler, but Science and Industry requires a 6 mile trip - too far to walk. The staff was very helpful and asked our sons if they wanted to play Fender guitars in our room - we picked out a nice red Fender strat and they delivered a guitar, effect pedal, and headphones so we could rock in the nice living room - and that part was FREE - nice fringe benefit. This is our first stay at a Hard Rock property and we liked it! If you know anything about architecture, then you will appreciate the building too. You can see it in the skyline for the last 80 years or more - way before the Sears Tower appeared. We hope to visit again within the next year or so!",nan,nan,ta_s681
trip_advisor,"I stayed here, and it was truly in the perfect location. My best friend and I were able to walk around the corner to get lunch at a local restaurant with great eats and find a popular breakfast spot steps away the next morning. We also found a local shuttle at a nearby hotel that took us to a casino in Hammond, Indiana which was a nice surprise.The concierge was super nice and accommodating. They always had recommendations and suggestions and made all of our agenda happen with ease.The hotel is also close to shops and the center of it all in Magnificent Mile whether you prefer to walk or take a taxi.We definitely recommend it!",nan,nan,ta_s682
trip_advisor,Fantastic stay at the HRH in Chicago. Staff were all very friendly and helpful. The hotel is located at the top of Miracle mile so it's an ideal location for shopping and seeing the sights. The building itself is a fantastic building with lots of history (notice how it looks like a champagne bottle?)Having stopped in numerous Hard Rock hotels around the world this one did not disappoint and we would definitely visit again if we find ourselves in Chicago,nan,nan,ta_s683
trip_advisor,"The Hard Rock Hotel in Chicago is in the historic Carbide and Carbon building from the 1930's. Each floor's theme ties with a band, I stayed on the Elton John floor. Great views of the city and a convenient walk to many great Chicago eating and shopping locations.Staff was great and the room was plenty big (sometimes old converted office buildings have small rooms). I will stay there again when I go back to Chicago.",nan,nan,ta_s684
trip_advisor,"Hotel is very central for doing most of the tourist things in Central Chicago, being only a few hundred meters form the river and on the main avenue. We had a corner room on the 15th floor , which gave a great view. The Room was quite spacious and comfortable , but it didn't wow us, the theming in the public areas was more interesting and we ended up taking the lift to different floors and walking up/down each time we returned to see the different exhibits. The period architecture of the public space on the lower floors is also very interesting. We took breakfast there for the 3 days we stayed and Lila was a most friendly waitress , who gave us some great advice on how to do things in the city.",nan,nan,ta_s685
trip_advisor,"Everything was satisfactory. The room was clean and the bed fairly comfortable but almost every thing was gray. So, the decor was kind of drab. The bathroom fixtures looked a little dated. The hotel is in a nice location on Michigan Ave just off the river. My only real complaint is that valllet parking was $60, which was a third of the cost of the room. I know I'm in downtown Chicago, but that just seems ridiculous.",nan,nan,ta_s686
trip_advisor,"We recently hosted our wedding at the Hard Rock Hotel Chicago and could not have asked for anything better! This hotel is in such a unique building and a fantastic location. The inside is very cool with lots of rock and roll memorabilia and cool lighting and finishing. Then you have the fabulous Michigan Ave. right at your doorstep for fantastic photos outside! The staff there is so friendly. Everyone is willing to help you and make sure your stay is perfect. I would highly recommend this venue for anyone who is looking for a fun, unique but elegant wedding.",nan,nan,ta_s687
trip_advisor,"Recently attended a wedding at the Hard Rock and decided to stay overnight rather than make the long drive back north to the suburbs. Could not have been more pleased with the hotel. Check-in was extremely easy, room amenities and decor were great, pre-wedding drinks and snacks at Chuck's were delicious and wedding was amazing. Great reception room, drinks and food! Highly recommend Hard Rock for an overnight stay in the city -- great location and staff!",nan,nan,ta_s688
trip_advisor,"Service is everything you would expect from a top-end hotel. Staff are pleasant and willing to help. Breakfast room is quite small, but adequate. All rooms and the hotel in general have the usual hard rock touches making it a great experience. The hotel also has its own hard rock gift shop offering unique chicago hotel souvenirs, but as usual with hard rock these are quite expensive. Hotel location is excellent - within ten minutes walk of the golden mile.",nan,nan,ta_s689
trip_advisor,"I stayed at the hotel for three nights over a weekend recently. Customer service was great, rooms were very clean, the whole hotel was clean and is nicely appointed. That being said, I'll agree with other reviewers that the halls/neighbors were loud and woke me up consistently throughout the stay. There were several broken items in my room, including a couple of lamps and the curtain rod. For the location, the price was great and I am willing to overlook a few imperfections, especially since they did not relate to cleanliness. Pack a pair of earplugs though!",nan,nan,ta_s690
trip_advisor,"I was supposed to stay here 5 nights for business. This is clearly not a business hotel but the company I was visiting made the reservation at the Hard Rock due to its location. This hotel is desperately in need to maintenance. The hallways look old, dusty and run down. I complained that the ice maker in the hallway was making terribly loud noises but nothing was done. It was when I got into the shower and saw all the black mold and mildew that I decided this was it. I'm posting a photo because this is not to be believed. The bathroom floor had dust and hair in one corner. The bathroom door was de-laminating due to moisture...I cannot recommend this hotel. Needless to say, the company is no longer putting guests here either after I showed the photos.",nan,nan,ta_s691
trip_advisor,"Awesome stay at this hotel right in the heart of Chicago! The hotel is located perfectly on Michicgan Avenue halfway between Millenium Park and the main shopping area so you can enjoy walks each way depending on where you want to go.The hotel is in a beautiful art deco building with some of the orginal features still remaining. Our room was of ample size, very clean and that free guitar makes it fun!Staff are cool, prices are reasonable but its the location that is the celebrity of this hotel.",nan,nan,ta_s692
trip_advisor,Stayed here for our third and final lap of our US tour. We came from Orlando and had to deal with an old hotel. So Hard Rock was a pleasant stay. Booked 3 rooms and the staff was very helpful. My sister had a problem with their small room and they upgraded that to a bigger room at the higher floors with the best view. The room was clean and updated. My wife didn't like an old Iggy Pop hanging on the wall half naked but I didn't mind. Toilets were clean and very comfortable. NO free WIFI though. Bar downstairs offers food and drinks. But closes a bit early. Very welcoming waitress who tipped us a great bar which closes at later with open kitchen. You could even play a fender if you wish to.,nan,nan,ta_s693
trip_advisor,"Stayed for two nights on the 22nd floor, King bed room. Check-in was fast and every staff member we dealt with the whole weekend were very courteous. Room was clean and comfortable. Can't beat the location. Ate dinner at Chuck's Manufacturing and was very happy with our food/service. Also wined & dined at the attached Angels & Kings bar/club, and again was pleased. Overall, I left satisfied, and would stay here again.",nan,nan,ta_s694
trip_advisor,"We booked a room thru Priceline and paid what we thought was a good rate for a room within a short walk of the Art Institute. The room was still not cheap, but we were thrilled with the location. When we arrived, we were given a room on one of the higher floors. This room had a faucet that was not completely attached to the countertop or sink, and looked a little worn in other ways. The view was unremarkable at best, looking out over some air conditioning units. The worst part was a loud squeaking noise that probably came from one of the units and was clearly audible in the room. We stayed in the room for less than 5 minutes before asking for a different room. We were told there were only 5 empty rooms in the hotel. They put us in a room on one of the ""tower floors"". We noticed that the curtains were frayed with torn edges, and they looked like someone had vomited on them as there were gross spots all over them. They needed to be burned and replaced. The view was better, and the squeaking noise was absent. My partner picked up a funky little pillow with a yarn cover off of the bed, and a piece of the yarn fell out. Cheap or else just warn out? Worst of all, the room was apparently right above at least two elevator shafts. Every time one of the elevators beneath the room moved, we heard a loud thud. After trying to sleep (unsuccessfully) for about 10 minutes, we again went to the front desk and asked for a new room. They moved us to yet another floor and this time, no elevator noise and no squeaking air conditioners could be heard. The worst thing we can say about our present room is that the bath mat is frayed. For all of our troubles, the management gave us free drinks. We appreciated the drinks, but feel like the property has seen better days. We know we did not pay full price for a hotel, but we do expect to have a room suitable for sleeping regardless of where we might stay or what we might pay. The noise levels were completely unacceptable in our first two rooms. We have to believe we are not the first guests to express concerns about them and are a little peeved that we would be assigned to them in the first place. If we had paid full price and had had the experience that we have had, we would have been furious. As it is, we just won't come back to this property. We think they are not investing money in the basic infrastructure and will probably dump this property at some point in the near future.",nan,nan,ta_s695
trip_advisor,"Was just hear for a work trip and had a great experience. The hotel has a great location at the corner of Michigan and Wacker in this absolutely gorgeous old building. It's a bit hard to tell the location because they couldn't up huge signage that would spoil the historical, old signage.The service was great with everyone being extremely friendly and efficient. The check-in process was great and my room was gorgeous. i was up on the 20th floor with a beautiful view of the city including some landmarks. Frankly my only issue was getting to the hotel. Because it's impossible to make a u-turn on Michigan, we somehow ended up on a lower level of the city that seemed kind of scary. Apparently, it's used for parking and such, and thankfully it's used by the homeless as a racket to make money by guiding out tourists who get lost.",nan,nan,ta_s696
trip_advisor,"Everyone was top notch. Our stay was perfect. The whole staff was very professional and polite. If you want a more private floor, stay in one of the Tower floors. We stayed on the 34th floor and it was unique from the rest of the hotel. The location is perfect. We were walking distance from most everywhere we wanted to go. The building across from the hotel on Michigan Avenue had several places to grab quick breakfast and lunch in it. While unloading my car I dropped my tickets to a White Sox game in the street. A few minutes later I got a call in my room, they had been found by Kevin. He could have kept them and gone to the game himself but he did the right thing. My wife and I did a lot of research before booking a hotel in Chicago and we are so glad we chose Hard Rock Hotel.",nan,nan,ta_s697
trip_advisor,"Not only was the room not what was described in internet: a suite studio for 4 people. It only had a king bed and a small sofa -not a sleeping sofa- when i asked to have another room they said this one was the one i had booked and there was no other. i had to ""beg"" literally to have a couple of pillows and a couple of towels to have one for each of us. We were 4.but that was nothing compared to being awaken by a very violent man knocking on our room door wanting to get in at 4.10 am. we called security and when security came the guy was gone but he came back twice more. the third time he said he would take the door down!!!as security was not there, i had to call 911 the Chicago Police Department!!!my husband, my 2 kids and i were very very scared!!!the hotel never appologised they just gave us another room but the service the rest of the time was very bad. we payed for a 5 star hotel and received a 1 star hotel service.",nan,nan,ta_s698
trip_advisor,"I was very excited to stay at the Hard Rock for my 5 days in Chicago. I have to say I may have had too high of standards for the Hard Rock so I want to make sure I am fair in what I say. I was able to check in early which was great, but I was only on the 8th floor. While I had a corner room, I could see into the building next to me. Literally a guy working at his desk. So, I had to make sure blinds were closed etc which made the room really dark. The hallway and rooms were a little dark as well, lots of grays and I think I was expecting more, brighter colors - a little more rock and roll and a little less blues. All of the staff was wonderful, very nice. The rooms was a great size for one person or a couple, comfortable, clean - and thank god for the alarm clock that played nature sounds so that us light sleepers can have white noise. No problem getting cabs, directions, anything I needed. The highlight was the Angels and Kings bar area. Great drinks, good food, great service! The location was AMAZING. On Michigan Avenue, walk to most places. I would stay again, if I could get a room that was a bit higher level - but to be fair, that is what happens when you check in early AND you are in Chicago - they have tall buildings!",nan,nan,ta_s699
trip_advisor,This was my first time in chicago and was expecting the hotel to be a high standard one... well i was surprised...the rooms are definitely not what I would call high end and not worth the price paid at that time... the service was terrible I was late to attend a wedding because the laundry service could not deliver my shirts on time...had to go buy a shirt and iron it and when you call the hotel guest service they lie to you and tell you the guy is on his Waaayy but god knows when he will reach... a friendly advise to all travelers dont go there....everr,nan,nan,ta_s700

Would highly recommend this hotel!",nan,nan,ta_s701
trip_advisor,"We had a two day work event at the hotel. Picked for the fun atmosphere and location. Meeting room, food, catering staff were wonderful to deal with. Hotel rooms were clean and had fun Rock'n Roll themes. Only compliant we as a group had, was that the internet was not good. At times very easy to get on, other times could not get on at all. If I was on vacation it would not have mattered but since we were there for work it was annoying. Would I hold another event at this hotel OR another Hard Rock Hotel yes! Thanks Chicago staff for a great time.",nan,nan,ta_s702

I was traveling with my teenage children and they loved the hotel. We had a great view, comfy beds, a spacious room, and my son loved that he could hook up his iphone to the speaker bar in the room. We also enjoyed seeing the music memorabilia on each floor.The hotel was very convenient for the river cruises, Magnificent Mile, Navy Pier (trolley access nearby), Millenium Park, The Art Institute, etc. - all were an easy walk from the hotel.Walgreens was across the street and several quick-service restaurants were nearby.The only flaw to the entire stay was that we didn't find out about the guitar program until too late!",nan,nan,ta_s703
trip_advisor,"After travelling for 10 hours we arrived at the front desk of the Hard Rock Chicago 3 hours before our scheduled check in and were thrilled to hear they could get us in a room right away, originally booked in a room on the fifth floor I asked the girl at check in if it would be possible to have a room a higher floor for a better view and less noise, again we were pleased when re- booked to room 2202, the highest level of the main building before the tower rooms.We didn't need baggage service but were still warmly greeted by the bell hop in the elevator as he was delivering luggage to another room, he was very personable and talked to us of his Canadian girlfriend and had even visited our hometown.Our room was cool in it's vibe but a little warm in temperature I believe the thermostats are on program we were unable to set them to cool in the heat of the afternoon so we just kept the curtains drawn and the sun out, the bathroom was modern, the tub was clean, the water pressure was good, the sheets were soft and the TV reception was clear. I believe the decor and ambiance worked for the theme of the Hard Rock, but I would have liked it to be more brightly lit especially in the bathroom, even with both ceiling pot lights and the glow of the magnifying mirror I found it dim for getting ready in the morning.We loved the location of The Hard Rock right on Michigan Ave close to the river, a moment to high end shopping, around the corner from great restaurants, and across the street from Grant/Millennium park. We found on the Hard Rock facebook page that the city shows movies at the Pritzker pavillion in the park on Tuesday evenings it was a highlight of our trip and we were glad to be so close that we could enjoy the movie. We found all the staff we came in contact with to be great and helpful it's a gift to be both ""Chill"" and efficient but they seem to have it down pat. Kudos to the front desk staff, concierge team and bellmen.We really enjoyed our visit to Chicago and our experience at the Hard Rock hotel and have already recommended that our friends and family look into booking there if they find themselves visiting the windy city.",nan,nan,ta_s704
trip_advisor,"The hotel is really beautiful, well accommodated, but the staff's attention to customer service was just horrible. Management needs to take some serious customer service centered training. I arrived at 12:35 in the middle of the night. The ticket was bought by the company I was consulting for. It was done through Orbiitz. Who also shares some fault here too. I was told I could not check in because the person's name who made the reservation was listed. Despite all the reservation materials were sent to me, as the primary traveler, and my name was listed on the reservation. Despite all this, I was told by the clerk I had to call the person and ask permission to use the room. Seriously, I have the home phone number of a secretary to call past midnight to ask permission? I looked at him and asked ""are you really asking me to call a person past midnight, as if I even have their personal phone number. Then he said that there was no other way,.sorry, nothing else I can do. I looked at him and told him that I had a 7:30 meeting and I am not going to stand here and debate the issue, just find a way.So he called Orbitz, and said to me, this might take a while, so have a seat and relax. Really? Its 1am by now, I just worked a long day at the office, and then was travelling for 6 hours and, had to wake up at 6am, no, I said, I am not going to relax and it cannot ""take a while"". I decided just to give him 10 more mins to figure it out. At which time, it is now closer to 1:15am, and I said, sorry, time is up, this is a nice hotel, you cater to business travelers, find out a better solution, hold the room under my credit card, whatever, I don't care, just get me in a room. 10 more minutes and he finally contacted Orbitz and they resolved the issue. Nicely, he upgraded the room, but I didnt really care, all I wanted was a bed to sleep. The loss of the hour of sleep really trashed my next day.So no, I am not happy at all. This is not the clerk's fault, it is clear he was ""just following orders"" and was not given sufficient authority to use the ""Nordstrom philosophy"", customer is always right, care for the customer first. They failed at this. Michael Hatzakis",nan,nan,ta_s705

trip_advisor,"My 11-yr-old son and I came to town as part of his Spring Break and wanted to see and do as much as we could. The Talbott was perfectly located and the price for the quality was outstanding. Traveling with a kid did mean that it was nice to have a Chic-Fil-A within easy walking distance, but we found several other mid-range eateries that served the less sophisticated palate. We also ate in the hotel restaurant and enjoyed it. We were able to walk to many sites and activities or take a very quick Uber or even the ""L"" or a bus. A park and library just 2 blocks away, walkable streets and sidewalks and, of course, my son loved seeing all of the high priced exotic cars valet parked for the shoppers on the ""Magnificent Mile.""",nan,nan,ta_s708

Room service was great. Food was handled by Mercadito the restaurant attached. It is a Mexican restaurant. Guacamole was incredibleReally a top-notch place hidden on Delaware Street near the John Hancock bldg. Not pretentious like some of the bigger-name brand hotels and not so hip I felt old walking in (i.e. no club music pumping on the speakers). And no nickel and diming customers here (free wifi, no ""resort"" fee, coffee in room, and great concierge)Great location too. Two blocks from the Red Line subway.

trip_advisor,"I cannot say enough positive things about The Talbott hotel. This was our first time staying here and found it via TA and other online reviews. We also got a great rate because they had a promotion with a discount for 3 or more nights. The staff here is super professional and very polite and helpful. We had a room with two queen beds and the room was large and spacious. Everything is impeccably clean and well maintained. It felt rather luxurious and the location is fantastic -- on a very quiet street but with good access to downtown Chicago. We did not try the hotel restaurant but there is a Starbucks on the corner near the hotel for morning coffee and a Pain Quotidien next to the hotel. One of the best things about this hotel is the staff who are always so polite and pleasant. The only negative thing at all I can say is that the valet and parking charges are steep at $60 per day, and on one occasion when I called down for the car they forgot to tell the valet and therefore we had to wait about 20 more minutes to get the car when we were already on a tight timetable. They were very apologetic. I really like this place and would make it a priority to stay here again when in Chicago.",nan,nan,ta_s713
trip_advisor,"This won't be a long review, but it will be very accurate based on the stay my wife and I just completed. We had a 2-night stay in room 504 for our wedding anniversary, and the folks at the Talbott NAILED it for us!Before our visit I e-mailed the hotel letting them know of our occasion. When we arrived, we'd been automatically upgraded to a suite at no additional cost. On top of this we had a hand-signed card from management and a box with 4 red-wine and chocolate truffles...yum!As for the room.....perfect! GREAT bed, nice robes and complimentary slippers, beautiful bathrooms with luxurious amenities, Kuerig coffee maker, and a quiet, peaceful, magnificently appointed room that made it an A+ in my book.Yes, parking over $60 per night plus tips in silly, but it IS downtown Chicago and nearly everywhere is a gigantic rip-off. We loved our stay and would do it again in a heartbeat! BRAVO TALBOTT!!",nan,nan,ta_s714
trip_advisor,"Honestly I will preface by saying I am more of a big chain hotel than a boutique hotel guy, mostly due to predictability and getting certain ammenities due to my status, so I wasn't super excited when my meeting was booked at this hotel, however everything about this hotel was excellent. Staff from the doorman to the cleaning staff were super friendly and always took the time to say hello, the in room ammenities were very good, with the one possible addition being complementary bottled water in the rooms, but honestly other than that there is nothing more I could ask for.",nan,nan,ta_s715
trip_advisor,"I'm so glad I read through the reviews on Tripadvisor and selected The Talbott Hotel. We enjoyed a wonderful stay at this charming boutique hotel. Location is superb and the service was exceptional. Our room was a nice size, well appointed & very clean. I appreciated the free wifi service and enjoyed being able to use the apple keyboard w/TV as personal computer. We did not have a ""room with a view"" but it certainly didn't matter with all the other fine amenities. Don't think I would want to ever stay anyplace else in Chicago!",nan,nan,ta_s716
trip_advisor,"This hotel is a nice place to stay in a great location. It is well managed and the staff is very nice. Our room was large and the bed was good. We booked the least expensive room, which I do not recommend doing. These rooms either have a view of a brick wall, which I suppose is not so bad if you are out all day...or worse the back of the Waldorf Astoria. The problem is that you will wake up 6:30 am to the sound of deliveries and garbage trucks. This noise continues all morning, even on the weekends. We moved to a higher room, and it was better, but still not restful. We would stay here again, but we would pay for a room with a view of the street, which is quiet. On our last visit to Chicago we stayed at the Thompson (eat at the restaurant, Nico), which was great but more than twice the price. Also take into consideration that Chicago hotel taxes are in the neighborhood of 17%-- causing sticker shock when the bill comes.",nan,nan,ta_s717
trip_advisor,We stayed in Chicago for part of our honeymoon and when we told the front desk we were upgraded to a gorgeous suite! Bigger than our first apartment and the staff was stunningly helpful! They gave us fabulous recommendations for food and it's in walking distance of the magnificent mile and everything else. They have a great special if you stay with Amex through the website you get a night free which was lovely. Fabulous stay and would love to come again,nan,nan,ta_s718
trip_advisor,"Nestled in between the big name player hotels on Chicgo's Gold Coast is the little hotel that could. The Talbott is an absolute pleasure to stay in! Large, spacious rooms, newly updated bathrooms with separate shower and deep soaking tubs, free internet and staff that absolutely bend over backward to be helpful, this is just a wonderful place to stay smack dab in the center of the action. Possibly because of all the chain hotel competition each way you look, the Talbott has to try really hard to get noticed, and try it does... Great prices...and great comfort make this place the only one I will ever stay in when returning to Chicago!",nan,nan,ta_s719
trip_advisor,"We always stay at the Talbot and have been for years.The Talbot is a unique experience. It removes you from the hustle and bustle of the big name hotels in the area. It is literally 60 paces from the Sofitel and a few more steps to designer shopping, restaurants etc. To me It is the best location you could have in Chicago. You are a a couple of blocks from Michigan Avenue and great shopping to east. To the north you are a couple of blocks from Lou Malnati's Pizza, the best deep dish in Chicago, or Gibson's Steak House to name a few. The shopping in the area is boutique based with Department stores thrown in the mix down the Miracle Mile. If you are or have a doll collector in the family, American Girl is just a few steps away. Whether you are here in the summer of winter it is a great place. Peaceful, quiet and relaxing. When you walk into the hotel it is an instant calm unlike the hustle and bustle of the loud convention style hotels. The staff is extremely personable. The doormen are polite courteous and respectful and just plain friendly. The atmosphere is a throw back to the elegance offered in premium hotels in past decades. Two Fireplaces flank the entrance and are as inviting as their sitting area is warm. Quality furniture and detail in each and every room. 42"" televisions and in the Suites you have access to a Mac Mini which runs TV and Internet. Regular rooms are well appointed. King Suites include a beautiful Bedroom, Separate TV Lounge/Meeting room with Desk and pull out couch. Bathroom has both a tub and separate shower with his and hers makeup/shaving sink or vanity areas. A feature i really enjoy is the separate heating unit that can be turned on in the very large bathroom to make it more comfortable when getting out of the shower. All totaled I am guessing you have about 800 square feet including the main foyer entrance area. Very comfortable. It has been recently upgraded. I prefer the old decor, but honestly this new decor is equally as nice. The in suite decor is far from dull with room accents and appointments in every room adding the decorators touch and feel to each room. The Beds and pillows are not worn. They are plush, comfortable, clean and always refreshed.Bottom Line Great Hotel, Great Value, Great Location and Great people. Do yourself a favor and stay at the Talbot.",nan,nan,ta_s720
trip_advisor,"My wife and I spent the weekend here for a little getaway after the holidays. The hotel and staff exceeded our expectations! This is the best hotel experience we have had in recent memory. The attention to detail and the helpfulness of all the staff during our stay was great. The room was very comfortable and well maintained. We where really impressed, and that's not an easy thing to do. The location is also very good, away from the crowds on Michigan Ave. but within easy walking distance. There is a good choice of restaurants within walking distance, along with things to do. We also used the Chicago bus system and taxis. Had no problem getting where we wanted to go. We definitely plan on returning soon.",nan,nan,ta_s721
trip_advisor,"This is a great hotel!! My husband and I stayed last May for a long weekend and we thoroughly enjoyed our stay! The location was wonderful and easy to walk to everything that we did. The bed was comfortable and the room was cozy, but not too small. Everyone was happy and the feeling in the hotel was very welcoming, even though it was unseasonably chilly outside. I can't wait to schedule our next trip and stay at The Talbott!",nan,nan,ta_s722
trip_advisor,"Super stay during a cold freeze. From the moment you pull up Dwayne and Charles welcome you and offer a lively, inviting and incredible atmosphere. The hotel is classic but well maintained. Rooms are nice and well appointed. The bathroom in the King Parlor room was quite large along with the room. Beds are nice and comfortable. The internet was acceptable. The location is great. The hotel is located in a good spot right near Michigan avenue. It is within walking distance of lots of shop, restaurants and the subway. This hotel is a gem in Chicago and you will absolutely enjoy the stay. On top of it all we were given the latest check-out we have ever experienced. This is clearly one of the best hotels in Chicago.",nan,nan,ta_s723
trip_advisor,"This review is long overdue from last July, though well deserved. Hubby and I stayed in your hotel for a couple of nights and as always, it was a wonderful stay. We've stayed with you several times over the past 5 years and your staff is always gracious and most helpful, smiles all around. We certainly did appreciate the suite upgrade--it was the second time and what a treat for us--thank you! Looking forward to staying with you again next month.",nan,nan,ta_s724
trip_advisor,"My spouse and I spent 16 nights at the Talbott Hotel over the Christmas holidays. From the door staff, to the front desk, cleaning staff and concierge, the service was outstanding! We always received a warm welcome every time we returned from a day or evening out. Gene, the concierge, was excellent and gave us great tips on things to do and places to eat. We always made a point of stopping in and chatting about our experiences... he was so much fun! All of his recommendations were top notch. Tim was also great and very helpful when we had questions. Dwayne, the door staff, warmly greeted us every day and always had time to chat and help us out with anything we needed, especially when we first arrived. This was definitely one of the best service experiences I have had staying at a hotel. The rooms were clean and spacious with lots of little amenities, and the location close to everything... just a few blocks from the redline and buses. I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone, and it will be the place I book when I come back to Chicago. Thank you to everyone at the Talbott... you helped make our first trip to Chicago an amazing experience!",nan,nan,ta_s725
trip_advisor,"Visited Chicago and stayed 3 nights at this wonderful hotel. Hotel is well-located and central to many places to visit and shop. Walking distance to major sights, including the Art Institute and downtown ""Loop"" in good weather for those who like to walk. Hotel staff - concierges, desk and door - were all friendly, competent, well-versed in answering questions and providing suggestions. They go out of their way to make you comfortable and address any need. Rooms were very nice with comfortable beds, lots of space for 2 of us, enough dressers for unpacking and bathroom had big tub. Hotel was very quiet at all times. Adjoining bar was terrific. Regrettably, we missed trying the restaurant. This was one of finest hotels I have ever stayed at. It is perfect for those wanting to sight-see, visit friends or family or just escape. (There isn't a pool or fitness room, but nearby privileges are made available.) Will definitely stay there again for any future visits!",nan,nan,ta_s726
trip_advisor,"This is our second visit to The Talbot hotel in Chicago. This hotel has a beautiful and quaint lobby featuring two sitting areas each with a fire place; beautifully decorated for the holidays. It is on Delaware which is a unique street off the beaten path not too far from great shopping and dining on Rush, State or Michicgan Avenue and other side streets which off some unique boutiques, antiques and cafes. Their staff, from the doormen to the concierge, are always pleasant and personable without being intrusive. The rooms are reasonably priced featuring some ornate and appealing European decor and each room is quite spacious and very quiet. Once you check in, you do not need your vehicle to enjoy the shopping, dining or people watching of some of the unique shops, cafes and nite life -- or stay in your room, visit the lobby and people watch or enjoy dinner at their in new restaurant located on the main level. We did not eat at their restaurant this time but would not hesitate to try it on our next visit. The restaurant name and style did change from our prior visit in 2013 -- and it was an enjoyable experience --- so I have no doubt the new restaurant is a unique and enjoyable experience with the convenience of being in the hotel.",nan,nan,ta_s727
trip_advisor,"We've stayed at the Talbott the last several years for a winter weekend getaway to Chicago. The Talbott is a charming, intimate boutique hotel. The experience begins with the doormen, who greet you with a warm smile - Charles always greets us with a friendly ""welcome back."" The bellman are accommodating and prompt - Perry always makes sure our bags are in our room within minutes of our arrival. The desk staff and concierge ensure all your needs are met. The same staff have been at the Talbott over the years we've been coming, a testament to the stability of the management.The rooms are warmly decorated and recently renovated. We've stayed in king room and one-bedroom king suites. We prefer the space of the suite, which has a large bathroom with tub, shower, and two sinks (one with a dressing table). The living room has plenty of space for the large sofa, two stuffed chairs, and a large desk. The Talbott is a short walk from Michigan Avenue and Oak Street shopping, Rush Street restaurants, and many other Chicago amenities. Yet, the Talbott is just off the main streets in a (relatively) quite location.",nan,nan,ta_s728
trip_advisor,"The weekend after Christmas, my wife and I stayed at the Hotel Talbott in Chicago. The hotel was clean and elegant, with a great location with a very quick walk of Rush Street and Michigan Avenue, but what really set the hotel apart was the incredible staff. From the moment we were dropped off at the curb, every employee of the hotel was friendly and willing to go beyond what I would consider the call of duty. I mentioned in passing that it was my wife's birthday, and they sent up a card and a box of truffles thanking us for spending the special occasion with them. I do not have a single complaint about the hotel, and I do not hesitate to give it my strongest recommendation.",nan,nan,ta_s729
trip_advisor,"For our long weekend trip to Chicago, I was hoping to find a hotel that I wouldn't have to pay $300-$400/night and would be close enough to walk to most of the sights along Michigan Ave. We had a great stay at The Talbott. The staff was very friendly and helpful, the location was perfect, and the rooms were just right for our needs. We spend very little time in our rooms when we travel, so it is just a matter of a good jumping-off point and comfortable accommodations. We were traveling with our nearly-adult children, so I booked two rooms (a king and double queen), and they conveniently located us around the corner from each other. I had seen so many review comments about Dwayne, and now I see why. Gave us great ideas on places to eat for breakfast and lunch. The location is 2 blocks from the John Hancock Building and 360 Chicago, and is perfect for Michigan Ave. shopping. You won't go wrong by staying here. Highly recommended.",nan,nan,ta_s730
trip_advisor,"My wife and I stayed at the Talbot the weekend of 12/26/14-12/18/14. Overall, it was a positive experience. The doorman quickly helped my wife out of our cab and had our luggage on a cart before I paid the driver. He welcomed us with a warm, enthusiastic greeting and ushered us to the front desk. We arrived appx. two hours before check in but this was not a problem at all. This was when things interesting.  The bellhop took our luggage from the doorman and said he would be happy to take our things to our room once check in was complete. We had reserved a standard king room and decided against the $60 per night upgrade that was offered to us. We were handed our room keys and told where our room was by the very friendly and efficient receptionist but the bellhop had vanished. Not spending for the upgrade so not worthy of bellhop service? I picked up our luggage from the cart and headed up to our room. When we opened the room we decided that the upgrade would be worth it. The room was small and the view was of a wall and fire escapes of the property next door. We called down to the front desk and requested the upgrade after all which was handled easily and our new room keys were waiting for us by the time we reached the lobby. So to was the previously elusive bellhop. Hmmm. Everyone else at the Talbott was wonderful. The front desk people always said hello when we were coming or going and the doorman was quick to hale a cab or assist with directions if we were walking. We did not eat in the restaurant, but I did have coffee there this morning and again I was met with warm greetings. The lobby has rich wood decor and two fireplaces surrounded by furniture that beckon you to sit, relax, and enjoy the space.  The Talbott is closely surrounded by taller building so if you want a room with a view, this would be a poor choice. The rooms are quiet though and kept very clean by an attentive housekeeping staff.",nan,nan,ta_s731
trip_advisor,"Needed a break from our routine, so we took the kids (14 & 17) for an overnight stay in downtown Chicago. Used Trip Advisor to aide in hotel selection and as usual we were not disappointed! The Talbott was warm and cozy. The staff was friendly and welcoming. Dwayne was particularly charming and helpful. Very clean, quiet, and comfortable. Easy access to tons of shops and restaurants. Able to park a block away for $41.00 after validation from the hotel (parking not my favorite part of visiting downtown Chicago as we spent over $100.00 for parking over 2 days between the Shedd, Navy Pier, and the hotel). We would definitely stay there again next time!",nan,nan,ta_s732
trip_advisor,"The Talbott is home away from home. From the minute you walk in there is an inviting atmosphere that makes you feel like you never want to leave. The hotel was decorated for be Christmas holidays, with two fireplaces. The fireplaces and lounge area around them were great to warm up with a glass of wine. The staff is superb, very accommodating. They were able to accommodate my very early check in. Gene the concierge was excellent, was extremely nice and had great suggestions on places to go.The hotel has an old worlds charm, loved all the wood finishes and the vintage decor. The rooms are cozy, and very comfortable. They have Apple TV and also control the in room computer. I found this very helpful. The Keurig machine was an added plus, very easy to use and convenient. Overall a great experience and great hotel. Can't wait to come back. Definitely my home away from home when I visit Chicago.",nan,nan,ta_s733
trip_advisor,"We were in Chicago for three days and chose this hotel because of the previous reviews and the fact we like smaller hotels. This hotel was wonderful! Every employee was friendly and helpful. There was some confusion about the parking charges and because of that, they adjusted our bill. To be clear, as of the date of this review, the valet parking is $58 a day. The self parking is $41 a day. The garage is around the corner from the hotel and is probably a three minute walk. We were offered an upgrade to a suite but decided not to take advantage of it because we were only going to be there another day. The turn down service was a special little treat - especially the chocolate on the pillow. The room was large and nicely decorated. The hotel was close to everything. We didn't drive our car during our stay since there were great restaurants within walking distance and sightseeing was within a mile or so. We love Chicago and we'll definitely stay here on our next visit. And kudos to whoever is in charge of customer service training! Whatever they're doing is working.",nan,nan,ta_s734
trip_advisor,"We stayed here during our first visit to Chicago last month. It suited our purposes to a tee. The location is perfect for exploring all the ""must do"" sites. It is withing walking distance of the waterfront, shopping, tours, restaurants, and major museums. The neighbourhood is quiet, yet busy and near all the amenities you need. As a boutique hotel, The Talbott doesn't have the conference and meeting facilities larger properties do, it compensates for this with superior service, excellent accommodation, and delivers great value. The concierge and front desk personnel are particularly effective, but all staff are excellent.",nan,nan,ta_s735
trip_advisor,"I last stayed here 7/8 years ago, The Talbott still has it's same charm and personal attention.Really for a major town hotel it is the best price/value I have come across in the USAFirstly Chicago is a stunning town to visit and saying here lying on Frette Sheets and using their bath towels is a dream, let alone all the other hotel services, A Total Pleasure! Thank you Talbott",nan,nan,ta_s736
trip_advisor,"Unbeatable value in the heart of Chicago, 2 blocks from Michigan Ave close to great bars and restaurants. Friends stayed at the Four Seasons down the street and didn't feel as pampered as we did at The Talbott. Everyone who crossed our paths in this hotel was super friendly and helpful, it was obvious they enjoyed and took pride in their work. If you want a high end experience without sticker shock this is the place to stay in Chicago in my opinion. We will return! On as side note, my husband left his jean jacket over a chair at the restaurant the morning we left and they mailed it to us in Canada, how nice is that?",nan,nan,ta_s737
trip_advisor,"Everything was excellent, from the fantastic valet service when I first checked in, to the final departure. The staff is superb: friendly, concerned and efficient. The room was an absolutely stellar suite: large living room with wet bar and separate desk area, a large foyer, a huge bathroom (separate tub, shower and commode room with two separate vanity areas) plus a large bedroom. Just a block and a half from the Mag Mile, it's right at the heart of it all!",nan,nan,ta_s738
trip_advisor,"GREAT boutique hotel. We have been looking for alternative accommodations for our annual trek to Chi-town and Duane, Gene and the ladies at the Reception area wow'ed us. For this special occasion, our SUITE was one of the best we have EVER stayed in; clean, neat, sleek, quiet and refreshing. The location is fabulous, walking distance to shopping, dining and live music. No question, we'll be back, so save us a place!",nan,nan,ta_s739
trip_advisor,"Look no further for the best hotel in Chicago! The staff was wonderful --friendly , yet professional. They even allowed us an early check in. The double queen room was the perfect size with room for 2 chairs to view the television. The location is what I loved. It felt like a neighborhood hotel. It is close enough to walk to Michigan Avenue and be in the hustle and bustle of the big city, but turn in a different direction and you can be in a charming neighborhood in 2 blocks. I can't imagine staying any where else . Well done!",nan,nan,ta_s740
trip_advisor,"After deciding on a whim to go to Chicago for the night, we booked the Talbott based on the great reviews on Trip Advisor and the reasonable price for a quality hotel and couldn't have been more pleased with our decision. The decor is on the traditional side, but very elegant and comfortable, not stuffy. The staff are incredibly friendly; when checking in we mentioned that this was our first stay at the Talbott and received an upgrade to a one bedroom suite! The room was 700 square feet with a huge, luxurious bathroom and very comfortable bed and pillows. The toiletries were also wonderful (and smelled awesome). Very central location as well with fabulous shopping and restaurants within walking distance. Would highly recommend the Talbott.",nan,nan,ta_s741

trip_advisor,"I took my goddaughter (14 yrs old) to Chicago for one of our city tours we choose each year as we explore great cities in the US. The Talbott met all my expectations and more. The rooms were larger than most you will find. We had a double queen room that was spacious and well appointment with WiFi on the television so we didn't even have to pull out our computer. The bed was just right with lovely comfortable bedding and pillows that were not too soft and just enough support and dust mite free (not pink eyes in the morning). The location was wonderful with easy access to within walking distance of two major restaurant neighborhoods, weekend outdoor market, an awesome little grocery store and the magnificient mile and the hop on hop off bus. My goddaughter particularly like the near by outdoor gelato and juice bar near Carne's restaurant just 2 blocks away. The staff were very friendly, personable and accomodating. The concierge made all our reservations and even got our boarding passes in the middle of the night and printed and delivered them under our door. We had showers on our last day and though it was wonderful trying several great restaurants in the area, we popped into the seafood restaurant in the hotel and had a very good meal before heading to the airport. Enjoy, eat and relax.",nan,nan,ta_s744
trip_advisor,"I picked the Talbott on the basis of the reviews I read here, and we couldn't have been happier. Our room was spacious, nicely appointed and immaculately clean, with very comfortable beds. My daughter and I liked the make-up mirror in the bathroom, and we all appreciated the plush towels and bathrobes. We were on the top floor but we did not have a view. That was not a major concern as we didn't spend a lot of time in the room. The concierge was very helpful in providing advice; we particularly appreciated her tip to visit the top of the nearby John Hancock building rather than stand in line at the Sears Tower. Somehow it came up in our conversation that I'd had a birthday recently, and soon a card and some chocolates were delivered to our room. Each time we entered the hotel the desk staff welcomed us back and asked how our day had been - and they were sincere about it! The location of the hotel is very convenient. We would most definitely stay there again.",nan,nan,ta_s745
trip_advisor,"I booked a trip to Chicago for my husband's 40th birthday. I chose the Talbott based on Trip Advisor reviews, and was not disappointed. The staff was lovely, they recognized my husband's birthday with an upgrade to a beautiful suite, a birthday card, and a small gift of chocolates. The front desk staff, bellmen and housekeepers were uniformly kind, friendly and helpful. The room was incredibly clean and comfortable, provided robes were thick and comfy, and the TV even included a linked computer for web browsing. The location was great--only a couple of short blocks to shopping on the Magnificent Mile, the John Hancock Building, and the American Girl Place (if that is your thing). There is also a CTA Red Line stop a few blocks in the other direction. Easy access to the Loop, it is walkable in nice weather.I highly recommend a stay here. My only suggestion is that the hotel improve their website--it was hard to tell what the amenities were from the website only.",nan,nan,ta_s746
trip_advisor,"Dwayne and the rest of the team at The Talbott Hotel were fabulous! We traveled to Chicago to celebrate my dad's 60th birthday, and we could have asked for a better place, staff or suggestions from concierge and other staff members. We were walking distance to the metro and fun activities. We received recommendations on great restaurants, blues clubs, and other activities (besides baseball, because we already had tickets to both Chicago teams' games). Thanks so much to the staff at The Talbott, and especially Dwayne!",nan,nan,ta_s747
trip_advisor,"I stayed here for nine nights in July 2014 as part of two months' travelling in the USA. It has to be the best hotel I've ever stayed in. Great location. I walked happily to most places I wanted to visit, feeling safe even at night. Good public transport took me further out of the city. You really don't need a car here.My room (at the back) was quiet and extremely comfortable. Everything worked. The service was up to old world standards for the serious traveller - no do-it-yourself technology here; while the internet, television and office technology were bang up-to-date. My plaudits to all the staff - who seemed to enjoy working here - and especially to the concierge who ensured I missed nothing I would enjoy. I left here to go camping in the deserts of Utah and Arizona, well-prepared and rested before the trek. I wish I could have found somewhere as perfect to recover afterwards.I arranged the stay at a bargain price at the last minute, and felt guilty that I had paid so little for so much.",nan,nan,ta_s748
trip_advisor,Had a wonderful stay at the Talbott. The Hotel is charming and the room very well appointed down to the Molton Brown lotions and soaps which were yummy. Everyone was helpful and friendly. The location is perfect for strolling the tree lined streets and looking at Chicago's architecture. I hated to leave. This will be my go to place whenever I am in Chicago.My only suggestion would be more plugs near the bed for charging devices. Can't wait to go back!,nan,nan,ta_s749
trip_advisor,"We stayed a full week in Chicago and couldn't have been more happy staying at The Talbott. Our deluxe king suite on the 14th floor was very well appointed; we particularly liked the large flat panel T.V. which included a fully operational Mac computer; this gave us access to anything we wanted on the internet, even our Netflix account! The furniture was a bit dated but the king bed was very comfortable and the bathroom had two sinks with a shaving mirror which my husband really liked! The staff at the front desk and elsewhere were just so friendly and helpful. We didn't eat at the adjoining restaurant but did have some drinks there; the rates were typical Chicago downtown rates...quite expensive. We enjoyed breakfast at the newly opened ""Le Pain Quotidien"" just down the street at the corner of State Street or at the Tempo restaurant just over on the next street on Chestnut. What we enjoyed the most about the Talbot is its location being so central to everything. Close to the magnificent mile, Oak Street Beach and then to the Red ""EL"" line and buses which can lead you to the Chicago River south or to Wriggly Stadium north...We thoroughly enjoyed our stay.",nan,nan,ta_s750
trip_advisor,"What a comfortable hotel! Quiet, well appointed rooms. The bathroom had good lighting, plush and numerous towels (Frette) and thoughtful touchs such as adequate and convenient towel racks.

Restaurants, transportation, and attractions were within walking distance.We ate at the hotel restaurant , El Mercadito. The seafood dishes were tasty, especially the smoked fish appetizer. The staff here was also very good.Try this location when in Chicago!",nan,nan,ta_s752
trip_advisor,"I cannot say enough about this hotel and its staff. I came to Chicago to celebrate my son's twenty-first birthday. I had spoken to Tim, the concierge, during the prior week to make some birthday arrangements and he also set up car service from the airport.. The lobby is warm and beautifully furnished. The room and bathroom were elegant and impeccable. The overall feel of the hotel is European right down to the charming and welcoming sidewalk cafe with colorful flower boxes. But the service was all-American in the best sense - warm, friendly, client-focused and 1st class!! I arrived very early and went out to shop but I received a text to let me know that my room was ready by 11:30 and was given an upgrade to a lovely 1 bedroom suite -- quite wonderful! When my son arrived from work everyone knew his name and did every thing they could to make our time and celebration special. And it was. The staff was outstanding - I actually had the feeling that they enjoy working there and enjoy people! They seemed to treat every person with attention and concern for their comfort. Special thanks to Tim, Dominique, Perry, Jamil to name a few but all were superb. A word about the location -- we loved it. Took great walks everywhere and it is right around the corner from Gibsons and the Magnificent Mile. At the end of the stay my son and I agreed that it had been one of our nicest times ever and that the Talbott atmosphere and hospitality was a big part of it. I look forward to another stay.",nan,nan,ta_s754

Concierge and front desk were super helpful with suggestions for sightseeing and directions. This is minor but I had a hard time keeping the floor dry with the terry cloth curtain on the outside of the shower curtain.",nan,nan,ta_s756
trip_advisor,"My husband and I celebrated our 20th Wedding Anniversary in Chicago at the Talbott. Tim, Gene, the front desk staff, guest services, and the restaurant staff treated us like a king and queen. We had such a fabulous time, we've decided to make this a yearly trip. We loved our stay and experience at the Talbott. It's walking distance to all the main attractions, which was great. We will always remember the Talbott, and the invaluable food, sight seeing, and other suggestions made by their staff. It made our vacation one of a kind. I will definitely stay at the Talbott every time I visit Chicago.",nan,nan,ta_s757
trip_advisor,"Fabulous location. Wonderful and helpful staff ,would stay again, clean, friendly, star bucks on corner and lovely breakfast and lunch opposite corner, walk to 900 shops, state street, taxi cabs abundant, so extremely happy. Dwayne a character to behold, Nigel and Ryan so fabulous. Will book again, pillows superb, comfy beds, clean well stocked bath....",nan,nan,ta_s758
trip_advisor,"I traveled to Chicago with my parents, husband and two children and really enjoyed our stay at The Talbott! The rooms were clean and comfortable and the service was amazing. We received terrific restaurant recommendations, directions and transportation suggestions from the concierge and many staff members. The location was great, close to shopping, restaurants, and transportation. We'll definitely return to Chicago and The Talbott hotel!",nan,nan,ta_s760
trip_advisor,"On arrival and throughout our stay, the staff were brilliant. Curtis on the desk was full of life and shared a laugh with us daily. The surroundings and fit out were very classy and everything was presented beautifully. The in room Apple control centre (including full computer facility with wireless keyboard) is a great addition to any room was very welcome to travellers who wanted to research their itinerary each day. The room, a king luxury deluxe, was very well appointed had very comfortable furnishings all in very good condition. The restaurant and bar serve great food and the chilli cocktail from the bar is surprisingly awesome. We loved the Talbot and on our return to Chicago, we will be staying there again.",nan,nan,ta_s761
trip_advisor,"I had never been to Chicago before I went to a conference there in July. The attendees were all booked into The Talbott. I had a very large room on the top (16th) floor. View not great, but the room had a very comfortable king bed, a couch and matching chair, TV (never turned it on), writing desk and chair, large bathroom with great big Egyptian cotton towels, a large closet and small personal safe. I hurt my knee while at the conference (in another location), and the helpful staff provided me with a mound of ice and extra bags so I could ice it. As usual, I lost my keys, and they were very graceful about it. There was a very nice-looking fish restaurant on the first floor, but I didn't try it. It would have been nice if there were a few more outlets close to the bed so I could plug in both my CPAP machine and my phone within reach of the bed. It was an easy walk to the lakeshore from the hotel, and less than a mile to the Chicago River for the architectural cruise that we fit in around our meetings.",nan,nan,ta_s762
trip_advisor,"Thank you to the Talbott Hotel Staff. From our curb-side experience to luggage handing to consierge through the entire stay, we had an excellent experience. At the north end of the Magnificent Mile, food and entertainment choices were excellent. Our family had touch-points with the staff and each touch-point was very positive. Thank you Talbott Hotel staff for your wonderful service on our stay this weekend!",nan,nan,ta_s763
trip_advisor,"Visiting Chicago to see my son for the 2nd time in as many months, we decided to move to another part of town. My parents recommended the Talbott and were they ""spot"" on. The front desk staff were very pleasant and upgraded us to a 1 br suite (maybe because my wife's a travel agent, not sure). This boutique hotel was gorgeous, well maintained, quiet and excellent value. Beautiful lobby, restaurant, bar and the rooms are ""sweet"". All staff were very friendly and helpful with any questions. Bellman Dwayne, exceptional. It's in the middle of the nicest part of Chicago with restaurants and shopping, the beach and all within walking distance. They also give you day passes to one of the nicest gyms/spa Equinox, right around the block. Try it, you'll like it! I'd go back here in a heartbeat and will recommend this to anyone who asks. 5 star.",nan,nan,ta_s764
trip_advisor,"My family and I recently visited Chicago and stayed at the Talbott hotel because of its wonderful reviews on Trip Advisor. We certainly were not disappointed. The location was great, one block from the hop-on-hop-off bus, 3 blocks from the Red Line ""L"", and within walking distance of many wonderful restaurants. The staff was top notch. They were helpful, friendly and efficient. The room was very clean and very comfortable and the bed and pillows provided a good nights sleep. The value was very good and we would not hesitate to stay there again. Thank you to the Talbott for a great mini-vacation.",nan,nan,ta_s765
trip_advisor,"This is our second trip to the Talbott Hotel, a return visit. We first came in December when the weather was fierce, but returned In August because we liked it so much. Great location, a few blocks from North Michigan Avenue and Oak Street Beach. We always like to get a run or stroll along the bike path and the hotel is perfectly located for access to the lake. The doormen and front desk folks are helpful and friendly. We want to give a special shout out to Terievis, who was working the front desk and found us the most amazing room. We were frustrated after a very long drive in from O'hare but he settled us in beautiful suite. The hotel has an excellent restaurant connected with an awesome bar serving creative and delicious cocktails - super convenient. You don't have to worry about this boutique hotel having a small fitness center, Tallbott guests can use the Equinox gym just down the block. The rooms are well appointed with good water pressure, nice furnishings, and get dark and quiet at night. Rates are reasonable too. I give this 5 stars!",nan,nan,ta_s766
trip_advisor,"This was a surprise trip to Chicago for my wife's Birthday. Stayed two nights the first weekend in June at the Talbott. The Front staff was very friendly on our arrival. The hotel is located within walking distance to plenty of shops and restaurants. The room was a bit of a disappointment, as when opening up the curtains, our view was of a water pipe and the roof of the building next door. I decide to book a room with Talbott because of the number of great reviews it received on TripAdvisor. This is a small and older hotel. I would say that this place is a good choice overall, but not as great as the other reviews I've read. Considering the room rates and number of other hotels in the area, we'd probably stay at another hotel for our next trip.",nan,nan,ta_s768
trip_advisor,"Beautiful facility, great service and perfect location. Great coffee and delicious breakfast. I absolutely LOOOOOVED this hotel. The room was fantastic with a large, clean, crisp and insanely comfortable bed. The check-in took a while because there was only one associate working the desk. While the hotel was pleasant the service from one particular front desk clerk was amazing. Kurtis greeted my group like we were old friends. He knew we were coming in for a corporate meeting and recognized our company. I am in the hospitality industry and by far he is one if not the BEST of the best. The next morning he was back at work again and recognized me by name. I even told him if he ever wanted to relocate to TX he was welcome to come on down. This is a wonderful place to stay for business. The staff is very friendly and efficient. The rooms are always clean and comfortable.",nan,nan,ta_s770
trip_advisor,"The Talbot is an olde-world hotel, a step back in time; the interior lobby is very traditional. The staff are great, very professional and helpful, easily getting taxis and advising on where to go in town. The only thing is the room we were in was very dark and there was no view at all. We didn't really want to spend much time in it (even though it was very comfortable and spotlessly clean) - just a tad depressing in terms of lack of light. Would stay here again as its very handy for all attractions, shopping and eating out but would ask for a brighter room with a view.",nan,nan,ta_s771
trip_advisor,"From the moment we checked in, the Talbott staff went above and beyond to make sure our week-long stay was top-notch. We arrived almost 3 hours early due to our flight and they handled our schedule with extreme ease and the finest hospitality. The hotel has a great location and service in Chicago's CBD, but the where it shines is in the details; turn down service with chocolates, ice delivered to your room, Apple TV and genuine staff.",nan,nan,ta_s772
trip_advisor,"Checked in July3 until July 6. Great location one block from Michigan Ave. Excellent service from the chamber maids, front desk staff and Chef Concierge Gene Murray. Gene recommended and made a dinner reservation at an excellent French restaurant. His recommendation for breakfast and a Chinese restaurant was also good. He checked us on United and printed boarding passes. The room was very inviting, clean, large, and well stocked. Our room faced Delaware Street which is quite and pleasant. Although, there are hand rails in the shower stall I will recommend a rubber bath mat to prevent falling when showering.  I will definitely stay at Talbot in the future and recommend it to friends and family.Patrick Ayoung",nan,nan,ta_s773
trip_advisor,"From the time you step out of your car and are up to your room, you are greeted by the most friendly attentive staff I have seen. The neighborhood the hotel is in is beautiful and so is the hotel itself. The hotel is always spotless and the rooms are fantastic. The beds/ pillows are soft and there's a MacMini in every room for the best in room entertainment suite I've ever seen. The concierge is amazing and always helps us to discover a new fun place to visit. The Talbott hotel is fantastic and I would highly recommend it to anyone. I spent my 21st birthday here with my Mother and wouldn't rather have been anywhere else. Every worker there from the front desk to housekeeping knew it was my birthday and they really made me feel special. They are family at the Talbott and I can not wait to visit again. I have stayed at many nice hotels in Chicago and not one comes close to the Talbott's classy design, rooms, service, and full package of hospitality. Also the hotel restaurant Little Market Brasserie is great and they offer an amazing room service menu too.",nan,nan,ta_s774
trip_advisor,"We were on a recent girls trip to Chicago and chose the Talbott Hotel based on TA reviews.Prior to arrival we asked the concierge for restaurants suggestions and provide us with a driver to meet us at Midway. They were very helpful with our requests. The hotel was lovely inside and out. They have door man service. A great restaurant and bar. The rooms were very nice. The beds were awesome! Comfy, comfy for sure. We had to have our AC adjusted because it was not cool enough. Once that was handled we were happy campers. You can not beat the location, walking distance (just blocks) from Magnificent Mile, the Hancock building, shopping, dining and more. With that being said this was a quiet hotel in the evening, no street noise, we had a room near the elevator and we never heard it. The front desk staff was awesome, especially Cameron he was a doll and so helpful.Would definitely stay here again on my next visit.",nan,nan,ta_s775
trip_advisor,"My husband and I recently spent three nights at the Talbott Hotel and wish we could have stayed longer. The hotel is elegant and warm, with charm and character. Located just off Michigan Ave, you couldn't pick a better location. I actually left some clothes in the room and realized it after we checked out. We called the hotel and they immediately shipped my clothes to me free of charge. I'm so impressed with their customer service that this is the number one hotel I would recommend to travelers to Chicago.",nan,nan,ta_s776
trip_advisor,You will not find a more friendly staff anywhere in the world. Even though I might never make it back to Chicago. I feel I have friends there. From the doormen to the maids. So professional. The restaurant is also very good and priced right. The only negative was my view of a brick wall. Next time I'll request a higher room with a view.,nan,nan,ta_s777
trip_advisor,"Following the reviews on Trip Advisor we booked this hotel and it certainly lived up to all expectations. Perfectly located for walking through Chicago, fabulous room and really helpful staff. We spent 4 nights here and enjoyed every minute. My only criticism was there was no teabags in the room and after 3 phone calls in 2 days I managed to get a couple. Bought my own box and carried them through the rest of my USA trip!!",nan,nan,ta_s778
trip_advisor,"Stopped here for a few nights and enjoyed our stay.Staff were as lovely as has been mentioned in many other reviews. We had a complimentary upgrade to a lovely spacious room with everything we required: safe, iron and board, sofa and easy chair, writing desk, alarm clock with lead for MP3/iPod, free wifi.The bed was heavenly - I defy anyone not to sleep well. Our room was slightly gloomy as we were facing the Waldorf which dwarfed the Talbott, so even though our room was on the top floor, the sky was completely blotted out.The location was in the north of the city, but within walking distance of many restaurants, Michigan Avenue and the John Hancock Tower for those with a head for heights.Recommended.",nan,nan,ta_s779
trip_advisor,"My wife and I took a short vacation to Chicago and stumbled on this hotel accidentally. It was part of an airfare-hotel package booked through Orbitz at an unbelievably low price. Upon arrival we were greeted like family and treated like royalty. The hotel upgraded our room without asking, quickly issued us our keys and transported our baggage to the room in matter of minutes. The room was way beyond our expectations. I have stayed in some five star hotels in Asia that do not compare. The bed was extremely comfortable and the decor was refined and tasteful. The concierge service was wonderful as well. They were able to get us into a sold-out restaurant for Easter Sunday brunch-- no problems. The location is great as well just off the Miracle Mile. Overall, I would recommend this hotel unconditionally.",nan,nan,ta_s780
trip_advisor,"I chose the hotel because it was in a central location and because amex had a good discount. I imagined an old school hotel from early 20th century - and having never been to chicago before it was a great introduction. The staff downstairs was very friendly and got me a wake up call and a taxi to get me on time to my 6am flight from o'hare. Unfortunately, i did not get to spend much time in the room as i only got back from dinner/club at 2:30AM and had to get at least a couple hours of sleep. I had a key card for the door, but i'm still not sure what the actual metal key was for... bathroom was very nice, but i couldn't find a toothbrush or toothpaste. overall a very pleasant experience, in a good location for a decent price.",nan,nan,ta_s781
trip_advisor,"We have recently returned from a one week stay at the Talbott.What a fantastic hotel-great comfortable spacious bedroom, prime location not far from Michigan Avenue and the lake.Staff were excellent from the minute we arrived until we left,had a free upgrade to an executive king room and had a late check out due to our flight time.Gene the concierge was very helpful and friendly.If you want an excellent quality hotel in the centre of Chicago choose the Talbott!Thanks to all staff for such an enjoyable holiday!",nan,nan,ta_s782
trip_advisor,"We stayed at the Talbott on a Saturday night when meeting up with some friends in Chicago. The hotel is in a nice location, near the shops. The staff were very nice and went out of their way to help us out. The room was nicely appointed and clean. The bathroom had a separate heater (not headlamp) for warming it up when you take a shower, which was nice. Best pillows I've had at a hotel in a long time. The room was pretty expensive, but at least they automatically upgraded us to a nicer room even though I didn't even ask. No views from windows other than another building about 15 feet away.",nan,nan,ta_s783
trip_advisor,"Every few years we go to Chicago over Thanksgiving weekend and we always stay at the Talbott. We love the location (2 blocks from Michigan Ave and close to great shopping), and always find the accommodations comfortable and the staff friendly and welcoming. Dwayne, one of the doormen, was a wonderful ambassador for both the Talbott and Chicago on this trip. He made a point to greet us each time he saw us and shared information about the area to enhance our visit. The concierge staff at the Talbott is also very helpful with suggestions, restaurant reservations and general information. The restaurant associated with the hotel was just okay, but the bar was nice and we had fun with the bartender as he suggested interesting drinks based on our particular tastes. There was also a great ""happy hour"" special that included drinks and small bites. I don't think you can ever go wrong staying at the Talbott. It's a really nice boutique hotel in a great part of town.",nan,nan,ta_s784
trip_advisor,"My husband and I came here for our 7th wedding anniversary. Our first time in Chicago and this was a beautiful hotel. We were pleasantly greeted at the door and the front desk was very nice. They surprised us and upgraded our room, it was amazing. Everyone was very helpful and the concierge Gene was extremely helpful and made us reservations for a boat tour and helped us pick where to eat. We loved Chicago and The Talbot was a perfect match for us, great location, romantic and overall great staff. We will be back for sure!",nan,nan,ta_s785
trip_advisor,"The Talbott is a very nice hotel - beautiful lobby areas and well-decorated, comfortable, good-size rooms. The location is excellent. My only gripe is with the desk clerk, who directed us to Happy Hour at the adjoining Little Market, where we discovered too late that Happy Hour in Chicago doesn't mean half-price drinks, but rather half-price appetizers. I think the clerk should have made this clear to guests who are clearly tourists.",nan,nan,ta_s786
trip_advisor,"The staff at The Talbott Hotel are welcoming, considerate and extremely informed with respect to Chicago's restaurants, tourist attractions, museums, nightlife etc.From the moment we arrived until the moment we left everyone sought to make our stay as comfortable as possible.Additionally, the location is well situated and major venues are within easy walking distance.This is definitely the place to stay if you desire attentiveness and an upbeat atmosphere.Written by King: May 23-27, 2014",nan,nan,ta_s788
trip_advisor,"You can't get much better than this. Great location. I love Little Market Restauutant. I was very pleased with The Talbott Hotel. It's just about a block from Michiagn Ave. Everything is walking distance. Shopping, Restaurants, and more. I arrived at The Talbott Hotel at 3:40pm, my room was not ready. That was not a issue for me because checking in was effortless, exteremely professional & Friendly at the same time. I was very please with the customer service Kurtis provided. Wow factor. He was very apologetic and sincere about the issue. Spacious room, Comfy bed, Nice street view. The Talbott Hotel really succeed at being a hidden gem. I will return with my family in the summer.",nan,nan,ta_s789
trip_advisor,"I love love loved this hotel. The rooms were small, but they were laid out really well. I loved that you could get online on your television and watch netflix AND they had a DVR too. We have been saying how hotels need to get DVR capabilities and to our surprise here it was. The bed was super comfortable too.The hotel was so clean and nicely decorated. All the staff were so nice and we were greeted every time we returned to the hotel. It made me feel really special. If you need a cab they will hail you one right outside the door and when you return they open the cab door and remind you to get all your possessions from the cab. This hotel thought of everything to make our stay amazing. They even provided umbrellas in the lobby if it rained, but we had amazing weather and never had to use one, thankfully. I was sad when we had to check out. We will definitely be returning to this hotel next time we are in Chicago!!",nan,nan,ta_s790
trip_advisor,"We stayed at the Talbott Hotel nearly seven years ago, but it still sticks in my mind as being the most fantastic boutique hotel I have ever had the pleasure to stay in. It felt as though you' were staying in someone's elegantly decorated country house, with brilliant attention to detail. The rooms could not have been more comfortable. The staff could not have been more helpful (we ate at some of the best restaurants we had ever experienced thanks to the wonderful concierge's recommendation). It definitely deserves the high TripAdvisor marks and I look forward to visiting again!",nan,nan,ta_s791
trip_advisor,"I spent 3 nights here in May when visiting Chicago with my wife. We took a suite so this review is not for standard rooms. Hotel is very well located, close to lake Michigan, Water Tower & Magnificient Mile. If you look for a fancy design hotel, not the place you look for however all the rest is perfect. Great suite with a nice living room (including Apple Tv), comfy beds, good bathroom, low priced mini bar and very friendly staff. The hotel also has a restaurant. Try the Parfait during breakfast, very good.Nice bar to end the day with a good drink. All of this at an excellent price (compared to other hotels in the same Chicago area). I would recommend this hotel and probably come back too!",nan,nan,ta_s792
trip_advisor,"My wife and I spent two nights here over the Memorial Day weekend. This was our fourth stay at this lovely property and we will continue to return. We stayed in room 702 facing Delaware Place. The room was large and the restroom even larger. The towels are super sized and soft. I generally find pillows at hotels to be too hard, these were perfect for me. There is a nice little coffee setup on a table by the front door. There really should be a trash can under the table to throw the empty coffee pods away. A highlight of any stay here is the staff. This time Dwayne the doorman and Gene the concierge stood out. The location can't be beat. Michigan Ave. is just a short walk away. State St. And Rush St. are basically outside the front door. You will not regret staying here.",nan,nan,ta_s793
trip_advisor,"The Talbott is one of the nicest independent boutique hotels I have stayed in. The service is superior to many chain or flag hotels. The location is simply fantastic and the hotel is beautiful in all areas (common space and rooms). The staff is very friendly and attentive. This is surely a small luxury hotel and a five star/diamond property. I think it is great for the business traveler, couples and families.",nan,nan,ta_s794
trip_advisor,"We just stayed at the Talbott. It was outstanding in every respect.: the room was very attractive, the location ideal (a block from Rush and two from Michigan), the service that of a five-star hotel. The hotel is not large so that everyone identifies you by name adding a personal touch. The adjacent Little Market serves a very good breakfast.This hotel also represents very good value for the money.",nan,nan,ta_s795
trip_advisor,"Excellent service with attention to detail. The people at the desk know you by name, and really want to make you feel comfortable. The location is perfect, with only a block and a half from N Michigan Ave. The Deluxe King room was very comfortable. We also loved the restaurant's outdoor sitting area which is perfect for enjoying a sunny May afternoon and people watching. I did that with my daughter, 10, and she loved the banana split. We were impressed by the connection to American Girl, although our daughter is too old for that.",nan,nan,ta_s796
trip_advisor,We had the most perfect stay at the hotel. Everyone we encountered was warm and friendly. The room was one of largest of any inner city I have ever stayed at and most definitely the cleanest. One night we called the hotel at 10pm after a show we went to and they called and made dinner reservations for us. Most impressive was on our way to the show we had gotten into the cab they had waiting for us we pulled up 5 feet when we realized we forgot the tickets in the room. When my friend went back into the hotel to get them the bellman had the elevator held for her when he noticed her coming back and knew we were in a hurry! Who still does that? I worked at 2 different hotels in Chicago and have never seen such attention to detail. Hope to return soon!,nan,nan,ta_s797
trip_advisor,"What a wonderful hotel with a great staff. We decided to spend Easter Weekend in Chicago to visit our daughter who is away at college. We definitely made the right choice in choosing to stay at the Talbot. The only thing tough about writing this review, is that everything was great so it is impossible to single out one above another. The staff was exceptional, treating us like pampered guests from the get-go, advising us on things to do, and hailing taxis for us whenever we needed one. The room was perfect and the apple mac in the room was very well received/used. Location was great too, a quick walk to the magnificent mile and aforementioned taxis picking you up right outside the door if you wished to travel further. I cannot recommend this hotel enough and will definitely consider it again whenever I am in the Chicago area.",nan,nan,ta_s798
trip_advisor,"There is good service, great service and outstanding service....The Talbott and in particular, Terievis provided outstanding service. I showed up a day early-I hadn't changed my reservation when my plans changed. It was the week of the national restaurant show, when rooms where scarce. Trevievs not only arranged for my room, but got me the upgrade I was hoping for....For those of you who haven't stayed at this upscale boutique hotel, give it a try. You will be overwhelmed by the curtious staff who all know your name and old world charm. Truly an outstanding stay!",nan,nan,ta_s799
trip_advisor,"We had a wonderful time. The staff provides excellent customer service. Dwayne, Bellman, greeted us warmly on our arrival, organized our luggage with his assistant. Our accommodation was a very roomy one-bedroom suite. The staff helped us organize an impromptu gathering. Everything was very clean. Our room was refreshed daily and left in pristine condition. Everyone was very helpful. When departing, Dwayne again helped organize our luggage so we were able to host a luncheon prior to our departure and still make our plane. Will visit again!",nan,nan,ta_s801
trip_advisor,"We travelled to Chicago with our two young adult daughters, and we all loved the Talbott, thought it was one of the best hotels we stayed in on our 7 week holiday in the US, and we stayed in some doozies. It's a lovely old lady, elegant and refined, but so comfortable, and the staff are charming. We were here for about 4 nights in January, in the middle of the polar vortex, so Chicago was FREEZING, even the locals were complaining about the cold, and the Talbott was our cosy, warm respite. It's in a brilliant location, many great restaurants in easy walking distance, and of course our girls loved the proximity to the Magnificent Mile shopping strip. We will definitely be back, Chicago is amazing and we want to see it when our eyeballs don't feel like they have frozen in our heads, and we will most certainly stay at the Talbott. It's just lovely.",nan,nan,ta_s802
trip_advisor,"The location was perfect; just 2 blocks from Michigan and a short distance from very high end shopping/Gold Coast. The Little Market restaurant attached was a great place to start the day, and enjoy some refreshing beverages! We had an executive king close to the elevator (which I typically abhor) and facing the street. I thought it was going to be very noisy, but hallway noise was worse than either of those and, luckily, we had mostly thoughtful neighbors that didn't keep the conversation going too long. Our room was really big and comfortable, and the Mac mini was a great addition. I would definitely recommend this hotel.",nan,nan,ta_s805
trip_advisor,"What a fantastic hotel! Everyone, from the doormen to the front desk employees to the concierge to the housecleaners, are very professional, efficient and friendly. The rooms themselves are immaculate and of the highest standards. Bed linens, towels, TV, furniture, complimentary robes/slippers, etc. are first class all the way. Guests have access to the top rated Equinox Fitness Center, located two blocks away on the world renowned Magnificent Mile of Michigan Ave. A very nice restaurant & bar is also located on the premises, serving healthy choices as well as American classics. All-in-all, this hotel deserves a FIVE star rating, not four. WIll definitely stay here again if I'm ever back in Chcago... which I plan on being.... wonderful city!!",nan,nan,ta_s807
trip_advisor,I was in Chicago for a reunion weekend and chose the Talbott for its location. It is a charming old world hotel that has been recently renovated. I booked the B&B package which offered me a wonderful breakfast at the restaurant attached to the hotel. I was upgraded to a two queen room which is larger than the standard king. The beds were very comfortable with turn down service. The bathroom was a bit small as compared to the room but nicely appointed and a great shower! Everyone at the hotel was so friendly and accommodating. A special shout out to Dwayne the doorman - he was always smiling and greeting everyone by their name. Parking is valet and expensive - but you can't beat the location and it is Chicago. I'm sure I will stay there again.,nan,nan,ta_s808
trip_advisor,"We stayed at the Talbott after spending a tiring couple of weeks driving across Route 66 from L.A. We were tired and cold until we pulled up out front where we were greeted by Dwayne. Dwayne had so much energy and excitement about him that we were quickly re-energised! The hotel was warm as were all the staff. It was exceptionally clean and well located. We stayed for 5 nights and made use of the gym facilities each day. Every time we returned to the hotel, whether from a workout or a day's outing we were warmly greeted and asked about our day. It felt like we were coming home each time. Dwayne really added to the vibe of Chicago for us and Gene the concierge also provided some good ideas and advice. I would definitely stay here again and would highly recommend it to others. We believe it helped make our Chicago stay very special!",nan,nan,ta_s809
trip_advisor,"Took my husband to Chicago for three nights for his birthday. The Talbott Hotel was the PERFECT choice. Friendly staff, especially appreciated doorman Perry's friendly advice and information. Large very clean rooms. Nice restaurant on the premises. Try the salmon breakfast! This hotel is an easy walk to restaurants and Michigan Avenue. I want to add that we travel about three months of the year, so we stay in many hotels during this time. The Talbott is a notch or maybe two above most other hotel choices. Oh, and the price is reasonable too considering the city and the location.",nan,nan,ta_s810
trip_advisor,"This place is a winner on all levels. The location is perfect, in a nice, clean area of Chicago right near the Hancock Centre and the Miracle Mile. It is walking distance to these great attractions and the variety of restaurants nearby. The rooms are immaculately clean with a beautiful interior. We stayed on level 9 and our room was very spacious and well appointed. BUT, the real winner is Dwayne. Dwayne works at the hotel and made it his personal mission to ensure we had a great time. He was exceptionally helpful in providing us with great recommendations to eat out and always greeted us with a smile and upbeat personality. This was worth the reservation alone! Thanks to the hotel for an amazing stay in Chicago. We would highly recommend this hotel to anyone and would certainly stay here again.",nan,nan,ta_s811
trip_advisor,"The Talbott Hotel is a lovely boutique hotel, spacious rooms, very helpful staff, attractive lobby in a wonderful location in Chicago, especially if you want to be close to Trader Joe's, Whole Foods, Barnes & Noble and within 30 or so walk to downtown Loop to theatres. My husband and I both have special, limited diets and the hotel even brought in a microwave and refrigerator to our room at no extra charge. It was enormously helpful. Having Barnes & Noble a 5minute walk from the hotel was great since it was rainy and cold and windy end of April/May1, maybe hit a record for low temps. Safe walking at night too. All in all, I'd recommend The Talbott to anyone coming to downtown Chicago, at a much better rate than the more conventional big hotels.",nan,nan,ta_s812
trip_advisor,"There are not enough words to say how much I loved this hotel. First the basics, the bathroom was sparkling clean, the air conditioning worked perfectly, the beds were very comfortable, every lamp in the room worked (oddly enough this is something that always seems to be an issue in other hotels!). The staff is above par. They really enjoy working there, and welcome each guest like their own family. We were traveling with our two daughters and the concierge Tim, and doorman Dwayne went out of their way to make them feel welcomed! The housekeeping that was in the elevator with us was even cheerful and friendly! The location is tucked away, yet so close to everything. My husband travels very frequently for business and stays at many hotels all over the world, he said he has never had service like he has at the Talbott. Thank you and we will be back!!!",nan,nan,ta_s813
trip_advisor,"We stayed at the Talbott on a short visit to Chicago recently. For a hotel so close to the Magnificent Mile, the prices are very reasonable.Dwayne, who greeted us, helped with our bags, and gave us numerous recommendations, was the perfect host, and made us both feel very welcome.The hotel itself is gorgeous, the rooms lovely and comfortable, and the restaurant in the hotel (Little Market) was so good we ate there numerous times. Everything (including the cocktails) was deliciousWe've stayed at plenty of very nice hotels, and the Talbott is definitely our new go-to in Chicago. Can't recommend it highly enough.",nan,nan,ta_s814
trip_advisor,"I have stayed at The Talbott numerous times over the years and it has become my favorite Chicago hotel. I recently stayed 3 nights and what a treat. I heard my favorite words at check-in, ""Welcome back. We've upgraded you to a suite."" The 1-bedroom suite was beautiful and exceptionally large in size. Talbott beds/bedding are some of the best I've experienced anywhere. The Talbott's location is exceptional, providing easy access to great restaurants, shops and Chicago's landmarks. Service is always high. Everything about this property makes it a great place to stay.",nan,nan,ta_s815
trip_advisor,"We spent 10 days in Chicago on holiday. I had chosen the Talbott hotel based on reviews I had read on Trip Advisor and other websites. The hotel did not disappoint, we arrived earlier than the check in time but were given a room straight away. The hotel is located near John Hancock centre (360 Chicago) and the Magnificent Mile. This was very convenient for shopping and some restaurants. The hotel is also a couple of blocks from the CTA Red Line, which allows easier travel downtown and we used this line to travel to Wrigley Field for the baseball.The room was very spacious and very very clean. All of the staff members we spoke to and sas during our stay were friendly and always said hello and welcome back. I would highly recommend this hotel if you are traveling to Chicago.",nan,nan,ta_s816
trip_advisor,"We thoroughly enjoys our stay at The Talbott Hotel, every time we stay. The staff is always great, awesome location, comfortable rooms, however this last stay was a bit disappointing. The issues had nothing to do with the hotel itself or it's direct staff but with the staff from the restaurant/bar little Market that is connected to the hotel. We have spent numerous stays here in Chicago visiting family and love having drinks and brunch at Little Market. I'm not sure who this gentlemen (if that's how you would like to address him) was or what his job position was with the hotel or restaurant. I have never been spoken to or disrespected by someone in my entire life. We would like to think the The Talbot Hotel would not accept this behavior in any of their establishments, especially when it is known that their guests will be taking advantage of the surrounding places. Please do not let this review sway your opinion on the hotel, but please be mindful of the service from the surrounding establishments.",nan,nan,ta_s817
trip_advisor,"We really enjoyed our stay at the Talbott. It is located less than two blocks away from Michigan Avenue and was therefor a great jumping off point for walks down to the Bean. Our room was very large, clean and had beautiful furnishings.To top it all off, my wife left a hat in the room, which we did not discover until we got home. She called and not only did they find the hat, they sent it back at no charge! This is really going above and beyond.",nan,nan,ta_s818
trip_advisor,"this was my second visit to the ""Windy City"" but my first visit to the Omni. On arrival the staff were very welcoming. The rooms in the hotel are all suites, which is quite nice.The beds (queen size in my room) are comfortable and the room was kept very clean. However I did discover a pair of designer sunglasses under the couch, obviously mislaid by a previous guest!! I would prefer to have had slightly brighter lighting in the room The bar/restaurant is efficient with friendly staff. The breakfast buffet is certainly adequate.The location on the corner of W.Huron and N.Michigan Avenue is brilliant.Yes, I would recommend this hotel.",nan,nan,ta_s820
trip_advisor,The hotel is a great place if you want to shop. Walking distance to The Art Institute The King suite needed a few upgrades but was fine. We ate at the restuarant for one night and it was ok. There is a great breakfast place e.leaven just about a block away if you want a good bagel. There is a great Italian deli with bakery about a block away.,nan,nan,ta_s821
trip_advisor,"The hotel was clean and very spacious. Great location, walking distance to almost everything. The bed was not very comfortable but the hotel itself was good. The staff was friendly and helpful.I would definately stay here again. The only thing I didn't like was the overnight parking rates. I know it's downtown Chicago and most things are a little pricey but when you're staying at the hotel, parking shouldn't be so expensive. It would have been cheaper to park in private lot.",nan,nan,ta_s822
trip_advisor,"First of all; remember this is an ""expensive"" city & not your hometown hotel; expect a little ambient noise of fire engines etc--get over it. Or don't come to any metropolitan area...Overall I give this Omni high grades (not perfect-nearly so though). I want clean; it was. I want courtesy & not fawning or obsequious service; got this too. This is near luxury with reasonable rates.The Sunday morning brunch is a reasonable $30 & an extremely reasonable $14 for our grandsons too. Restaurant has expansive view of Michigan Ave from the 4 th floor perspective. We also had some nice drinks & Cognac the evening prior with nice price point.",nan,nan,ta_s823
trip_advisor,"This is our first time at the Omni Chicago but we always enjoy our experience at an Omni. Top notch service and you should definitely become a preferred guest. You can't beat the location right in the middle of the magnificent mile, we walked to the American girl doll store and other stores several times throughout the trip. I would have definitely given it five stars except I booked the room for two adults and one six year old child yet there was only one bed in the room. We had to pay an extra $20 for the roll away bed for my daughter. It seems if they ask the number of people and ages when you book they should include the accommodations in the price of the room. Also, I had been watching the price on the Omni website as I wanted to book the American girl package but when I went to actually book the price had been raised over a hundred dollars for all the rooms. I was able to go back to Expedia and get it for much cheaper. I would expect to be able to get the cheapest price on the Omni website when logged in as a preferred member.",nan,nan,ta_s824
trip_advisor,"Stayed at the Omni Chicago from December 19th thru the 21st and it was the best stay in Chicago I have encountered. I have been to Chicago many times, but this is my first stay at the Omni and I look forward to many more stays. The hotel and staff are wonderful. I un-expectedly received a tray with 4 delicious cake samples for my birthday free of charge and it was just so special. When in Chicago...by all means stay at the Omni. Thank you.",nan,nan,ta_s825
trip_advisor,"This Omni continues to lack good management. Fortunately, the staff is wonderful (especially in the 626 restaurant & bar, and Mirham the doorman) which is why we return. The food & beverage is very good. The rooms are a bit weary & dreary but I understand that renovations are underway. Unfortunately, on our recent visit my request for a renovated room was ignored even though I am at the highest level of their loyalty program. The Select Guest loyalty program is no enticement to stay at an Omni.",nan,nan,ta_s826
trip_advisor,"Hotel room was showing wear. Carpeting in poor condition. Furniture beat. TVs old. Room needs to be updated. I really like Omni Chicago. Staff is always friendly. Great location. We were initially given a 9th floor room and our reservations were for an upper floor. We changed rooms to the 18th floor. This was OK, but still not an upper floor. It was really difficult to raise and lower the window shade for the window over the bed (we had a corner room). I am 6'2"" and my wife would not be able to raise and lower without standing on the bed.",nan,nan,ta_s827
trip_advisor,"Just finished a 3 might stay at the Omni Chicago, I chose the hotel for the location close to Michigan Avenue (Christmas shopping time), River North for the restaurants, and still accessible to the loop for my meetings. Excellent customer service, nice room, furnishings, the on-site restaurant for breakfast was excellent, used the fitness center and it was big with high quality machines. So the two problems were the internet service (I had to change rooms to get connected, and then it was slow and somewhat intermittent.) The other challenge was that the windows were drafty, and the furnace ran almost full time trying to heat the room. I finally figured out to pile the pillows against the curtains to keep the draft off the bed. Not sure if this is a problem in all the rooms, or just my King Suite, which was on the corner (what I had.) I would stay again, but maybe not in the winter.",nan,nan,ta_s828
trip_advisor,"Found a great deal through Travelzoo that includes room, parking and $30 voucher for $189. Considering the normal rate of over $250/night just for the room, I was lucky to have found this awesome deal! Being my first time in Chicago, I had no idea what to expect in the windy city. After searching through many hotel choices, I liked the Omni because it was one of the few hotels that offer a room with living area and a spacious bathroom. Most of the hotels in Chicago only had very tiny rooms with rates over $200/night. Omni hotel is located close to Miracle mile where you can also find lots of popular wine bars, restaurants and tourist attractions. If you plan on going to Chicago for business, this is a great hotel for ease of public transportation and location. The bar inside the hotel offered one of the best cocktails and desserts you can enjoy after a long day of walking around the city or after work. Service is top notch and overall everything was clean, well kept and quiet. The only downside was having to deal with small TV's in both the living area and the bedroom.",nan,nan,ta_s829
trip_advisor,"This was my second time staying at the Omni Chicago. All the rooms are suites which I like & the staff is always pleasant. The recently upgraded the furniture in the lobby & my only suggestion would be to upgrade the rooms. The carpet was coming up in ours. The room was clean & beds were comfortable so that made up for it a little. Also, just thought the quality of the food didn't meet the price but hotel food is usually overpriced everywhere you go.",nan,nan,ta_s830
trip_advisor,"We were greeted by the most friendly doorman! A great way to start your vacation. The bellman inside was really nice, as well. Gentleman at reception wasn't very friendly, but the woman on the phone when inquiring about wifi was so kind and helpful. Concierge was knowledgeable and enjoyed the pub he recommended. Our room is very comfortable and roomy, too. Beds were amazing, slept so good. Room clean, no view for us, but spent little time in room. Would definitely come back!",nan,nan,ta_s831
trip_advisor,"It has the best location just in the middle of Michigan Avenue and that was my principal reason for staying there. Rooms are very comfortable since they have a separate living room with TV. We had a bad situation when checked in since they assigned us a room on the side of the building where they did some maintenance work that day and we had no water in the bathroom and if some water came out, it was sooo dirty. After some time trying solve the problem, we had to move to another room and gave us that night free of charge. I will never understand why assign rooms where they know may have some problems and make guests go thru all this when they had empty rooms in other areas where maintenance did not affect them. It was my birthday and my husband pre-ordered a bottle of champagne to our original room for that night and by the time this ordeal finished, it was too late and we just went to sleep and had to celebrate the next day. After this, everything continued fine during our stay.",nan,nan,ta_s832
trip_advisor,I've stayed here several times and am always impressed. The rooms are large with great views. The staff is professional and friendly. Service is spot on and the property is clean with attention to detail. Excellent location on Michigan Ave. What more can I say. Great fitness center although it was pretty warm for my run this morning. I really like this hotel and will continue to make it my first choice when staying in the city.,nan,nan,ta_s833
trip_advisor,"We stayed here for two nights for a ""stay cation"". We had a fabulous experience. Immediately on our arrival, the bell staff presented our 4 & 6 year olds with complementary backpacks filled with crayons, activities, a few other surprises. Our kids were ecstatic! On our first night there, our kids were presented with milk & cookies before bed. What a fun treat! The room was very spacious and clean and we had more than enough room for all of us. The pool was fun and our kids loved it. Room service was excellent and the quality of the food was very good. The location is great - we made it easily here from OTC and loved being in the center of everything. We were very pleased with every hotel employee we came into contact with and loved feeling like they were happy to have our family as guests. We will definitely be staying here again!",nan,nan,ta_s834
trip_advisor,"Not what I'd hoped for esp since Oprah's guests used to stay here. The bedroom in our suite was freezing no matter how high we set the thermostat in the sitting room. There was old toothpaste on the sink bowl from previous guest & the sink water ran rust colored due to previous issues w/the mini fridges on that side of the bldg. Mini fridge was warm....never got cold. Pocket door kept falling off the hinge. This room def needed some new paint. Our room never got refreshed on the 2nd day even after having called to have it done. Had to call for more towels & toiletries. There was an issue w/our gift card upon check in for the room package we chose. Took 24 hours to resolve a piddly $10 gift card changing it from iTunes to a Starbucks. Parking is very expensive, but we used it. Location is perfect & customer service is very good, but will not stay here again or recommend.",nan,nan,ta_s835
trip_advisor,"We just returned from a three night weekend stay at the Omni. This was our third visit to this hotel and the first time we brought our two small kids. We like this hotel for the Parking & Breakfast package. The sticker price may seem high at first, however, if you choose a cheaper hotel and pay extra for a full breakfast and overnight parking, the price is very similar. The Omni is located in a great location, offers very nice (suite) accommodations and the breakfast is first class. With an inviting bar as well as a pool, it's a complete experience. Upon arriving at the hotel, the valets quickly unloaded our gear and we were soon checking in and heading to our room with little delay. The kids were also greeted with mini-backpacks filled with activities...a very big deal! As we tried to turn on the lights, one of the bulbs was apparently burned out. My wife called maintenance and within a few minutes, he was there. Earlier in the day, we lost our beloved dog of nine years who was hit by a car in the AM. After dealing with the details and shock, we still headed to Chicago. In striking up a conversation with the maintenance man, we told him of the loss of our dog and our rather emotional day with the kids. That evening, upon return from dinner, we were pleasantly surprised to a tray of goodies in our room including some wine, cookies and milk, as well as a personal hand written note from the staff offering condolences for our loss. It was an absolutely well received gesture and it was heartfelt and appreciated.The Omni has a few quirks such as some maintenance needs on the fitness equipment, but it is a well run and comfortable hotel that we are certain to return to in the future.",nan,nan,ta_s836
trip_advisor,"The Omni Hotel never disappoints. This is probably our 7th or 8th time staying here. I especially appreciated the nice fitness facility with swimming pool. It was an unseasonably cold weekend and the fitness center was a nice alternative to exercising outdoors. As always, the breakfast offerings were wonderful. I wouldn't go anywhere else for breakfast! This time we also had a great selection of salads for lunch. We will be back!",nan,nan,ta_s837
trip_advisor,"You can't beat this hotel in terms of location or guest services on Michigan Avenue. Love having the suites so that my husband and I, if we are on different sleep/wake cycles, don't bother each other. Always met with a friendly smile from all of the hotel staff. Rooms are clean and maintained nicely. Parking is outrageous (typical of Chicago,) but there is a lot directly across the street for half the price. We moved our vehicle after the first night.",nan,nan,ta_s838
trip_advisor,"We enjoyed our 3 day getaway to Chicago very much. Excellent service by all of the employees. We stayed in an Executive Suite which was worth the extra money. The room was comfortable as far as size. I understand from an employee that the rooms will be upgraded which is needed as far as furniture, carpeting, etc. It is much needed. Otherwise the rooms were very clean. Kudos to maids. The only reason I rated the hotel 4 stars is because of the rooms needed an update otherwise it was a perfect stay.",nan,nan,ta_s839
trip_advisor,"My husband and myself had the pleasure of staying in the Omni Chicago Hotel for a week. We found the accommodation to be excellent, the bed was so comfortable, lounge and kitchenette more than met our needs. We enjoyed breakfast and found there to be a wide choice and variety. We tried different restaurants in the evening apart from one night and found the menu to be extensive.The hotel was ideally situated for shopping, sight seeing and transport links.We found all the staff to be unbelievable, from the cleaning staff to those on reception. We found them to be very, very pleasant, helpful, informatative and great 'craic'.We would highly recommend this hotel.",nan,nan,ta_s840
trip_advisor,"Front desk and door staff were above expectations and each time we entered and exited the hotel, the front desk personnel and doormen kindly greeted us and provided us with immediate and knowledgeable assistance. Location of the hotel and fitness centre were also above expectations. Rooms were small and entertainment equipment was outdated. I have not seen such an old/poor quality TV in a 4.5 star hotel before and was a bit surprised that it would still have tube televisions. The rooms were small and furnishings were outdated.",nan,nan,ta_s841
trip_advisor,"Granite the rooms need some updates, old t.v. in the bedroom, sitting room... chairs vs. couch etc. but overall rooms are fine. The views we had in our room were outstanding with a small view of the lake through the buildings.The location and the welcoming staff makes the Omni in Chicago a very good choice in downtown hotels. Sign up for there rewards card and get turn down service, free wifi and a beverage of you choice delivered to your room in the morning,.",nan,nan,ta_s842
trip_advisor,"From the first moment we felt welcomed. The staff at the door, front desk, ( Nicky was so very nice), and house keeping, ( yes, we got 15 extra hangars!) made for a great stay. The staff at the door was very good in pointing us out to where we wanted to go. One time they were concerned that we wanted to walk to Second City. We did and it was just fine. On our return, they asked about it!This hotel is in a great location. The suite was well laid out and there was a lot of storage. The bathroom was a good size. Only complaint was the toilet made a weird noise. We were on the 23rd floor and street noise did not bother us at all.",nan,nan,ta_s843
trip_advisor,Very welcoming staff and helpful concierge. Check-in was very timely the room was very lovely. The turndown service was amazing and the young lady who did the turndown service was just the most friendly and wonderful person ever. I highly recommend this place the location is perfect and the staff goes far and beyond. I shall return and stay here again. They were also very accommodating and was able to put me in a to bed sweet when I booked a king. Just a loss of words for great service.,nan,nan,ta_s844
trip_advisor,"When we requested a lake view they said they didn't have many. Needless to say we were delighted with a narrow slice view of Lake Michigan through some buildings! Close to many attractions and the shops on the Magnificent mile. We had the breakfast buffet which was wonderful; omelets, toast, pastries, fruit, etc. Walked to Bobby's bike rentals and the river tour! We found a trader joe's nearby (buy a reusable shopping bag as a Chicago souvenir). There is a swimming pool with two outdoor deck areas with chaise lounges. My only complaint was that the mattress pad felt a little crinkly through the sheets, my husband didn't notice.",nan,nan,ta_s845
trip_advisor,"Stayed at Omni 3 nights last weekend. Great location for tourist: close to shopping, attractions, and CTA (train/bus). Spacious suite with 2 double beds, large bathroom, and living room. TV in bedroom and living room. Comfy bed. Would have given 5/5, but decor needs refreshed (our rug was rippled, wallpaper peeling a little).Excellent hotel staff: from check-in (they had a feather free room ready!!!), to complimentary wine in honour of our special celebration, to cleanliness throughout hotel. SPECIAL SHOUT OUT TO CONCIERGE MARCUS, who was so helpful and patient.Would recommend this to couples or families or solo traveller, and will definitely look at Omni hotel in other cities based on this experience. 4.5/5",nan,nan,ta_s846
trip_advisor,"I walked by this hotel for 10 yrs and never thought of it as anything other than the ""official hotel of the Oprah Witney show."" I moved away a year ago and was back in town on business. My company put me the Omni and I was pleasantly surprised. (So much so that I've since stayed at another Omni in Houston -which was great!). I had a king room with a separate living area. The bed was comfortable, the pillows soft and abundant. The living area was spacious with 2 club chairs, a desk and a wet bar. The bathroom was large. My only comment to the hotel staff is turn the TVs off. The maid staff turns the TV on, tunes it to the hotel channel and leaves it on after they leave. It's left on for hours until the guest returns to the room and turns it off. Huge waste of electricity.",nan,nan,ta_s847
trip_advisor,"This is a well located hotel for those visiting the city as tourists. Possibly not so well located for business travellers as it is two thirds of the way down the Mag Mile and therefore well outside the business district.That said the rooms are large. We had two genuine suites. With TV in both the lounge and bedroom.Staff were friendly and helpful and very easy to get too and from everything we wanted to see and plenty of food options in the area.The only factor holding back the fifth star is that wifi is a chargeable extra, which I think is very out of date, and there are not enough charging points in the room. Ended up unplugging lights to charge up phones, cameras etc. I would certainly use this hotel again.",nan,nan,ta_s848
trip_advisor,"I stayed for a week in a deluxe suite (queen size bed). The room was on the 8th floor and thus a bit dim (the photo on the webpage is certainly a bit sugarcoating). However, cleanliness was excellent as was the quality of the matress, so the stay was quite comfy overall. All the staff was very friendly and helpful. The breakfast buffet in the restaurant was excellent. Overall I would certainly recommend the hotel.",nan,nan,ta_s849
trip_advisor,"Love this place for traveling with family. Usually we stay at the Drake but being a historic hotel, the rooms are small and the hotel is not extremely family friendly. This place is 100% family friendly. Extra space in the suite was a great perk. Staff were always super helpful- especially the bell hop and the people working downstairs at the entrance. They even gave my children bags with goodies to keep them busy! Beds are comfortable. Bathroom was large. Wet bar as a nice perk! Just wish they had a mini fridge at no extra cost. Will stay with family again!",nan,nan,ta_s850
trip_advisor,"Chicago was our first spot on this year's holiday. I chose the Omni because of the overall reviews, its situation right on the Magnificent Mile but mainly because our family of 5 could share a suite; this is relatively rare particularly in big cities where room size is often at a premium.The hotel was in a great spot - we were able to walk to Bobby's Bike Hike and then back from the CAF boat tour which meant that sightseeing was easy and we could also take advantage of the shops that were close by. Yes the bedroom was a little tired in places and the TV in the bedroom was pretty old but hey we were in Chicago in wonderful weather to enjoy this great city and not to sit in our room watching American television. We don't usually eat in our hotels preferring to get out and try smaller restaurants. We had planned to have breakfast in Sunny Side Up before our bike tour but were up so early that it wasn't open. We therefore took breakfast in the Omni in the fabulous 4th floor dining room overlooking the street. It was first class and well worth the money and the staff were delightful. We would definitely stay again if the chance comes up.",nan,nan,ta_s851
trip_advisor,"All the good reviews talk about the only good thing about the hotel, the location. It's awful. It takes 10 minutes to catch the 2 different elevators required to go to the room. Broken security locks in the room, awful decorating, and what I think is a 21 inch tube television, which I cannot see from the bed very well. I am checking out today and going to find another hotel. Badly in need of a renovation, I've stayed at many great Omni Hotels.",nan,nan,ta_s852
trip_advisor,"We spent 4 nights at the Omni Chicago in July. Hotel was very nice and great location! Staff was very friendly and accommodating. Request a corner room on a higher floor. Lots of windows and great views of the city. Walking distance to Navy Pier, Lou Malnati's pizza, and great shopping everywhere. Taxi to O'Hare was about $40. You can take the train, but it's about a 4 block walk from the train station to the Omni. Rooms were a little on the small side, but we didn't spend a lot of time in the room so it was fine. Sirens are sounding frequently, but that was expected in downtown Chicago. I would stay at this hotel again!",nan,nan,ta_s853
trip_advisor,"Vacationing in Chicago and stayed at the Omni Hotel. The service at this hotel was excellent for us. The front desk staff was extremely courteous and helpful. Checking in only took a matter of minutes. Our room was comfortable and quiet. The front door staff was awesome!!! They were so friendly and always willing to help us with recommendations or directions. Whenever we return to Chicago, we will definitely stay at the Omni again! Thanks for helping to make our vacation a great one!!",nan,nan,ta_s854
trip_advisor,"There is nothing wrong with this place and I enjoyed my stay there. It just seems like for every one thing the place has going for it there is another thing that holds it back. The one exception is probably that it has an excellent location. The rooms are big, which is nice, but they are also dated. The place is clean, but it also lacks any sort of ambiance. You have to take an elevator to the lobby and then you also have to take another elevator to the floor with the bar or to your room. It makes it so that the place really doesn't have an energy to it. It's kind of like being at an airport gate with a check in desk. I wouldn't discourage anyone from staying there but I also wouldn't recommend it. The staff was fine, but that's about it. Nobody was over the top nice or went out of their way, but at the same time nobody was rude or anything. Just dull and dated. They should shell out $20/hour to get a piano player in the lobby and maybe set up a small bar or something to breath some life into the place. It was just kind of like a boring date, where afterwards you think the person was fine and nice and you can't say anything too bad about them but you don't have any burning desire to go out with them again either.",nan,nan,ta_s855
trip_advisor,"we stayed for one night in july. we were there for a trade show at the merchandise mart..the location is great! right off Michigan Ave and only a 6 or so block walk to the mart. my room was lovely. although the bathroom was a little disappointing..I expected a nicer tub/shower area, although this is not a deal breaker. I did have a problem with the shower and the front desk had someone at my room in 5 minutes!! and he fixed it immediately!! like mentioned in other reviews, the double elevator thing is a little annoying. it is a little pricey, the location and the service justify the price.",nan,nan,ta_s856
trip_advisor,"This is now the third Omni hotel in which I've stayed and this was the best. I had a mini suite, with bedroom, bathroom, and lounge area. It was well equipped with a sink in the lounge area, tea/coffee facilities. Despite being beside the service elevator, I couldn't hear anything from it. Two minor areas of irritation. The lift system would be much better if you Could go straight to your floor, rather than going to floor three or four and then changing elevator. Secondly, the mini bar prices are VERY misleading. I had a snickers, advertised as$3 but in the bill it came to more than $5 when tax and restocking fee were added. I realise there is probably a note buried somewhere about the restocking price but it seems very expensive.",nan,nan,ta_s857
trip_advisor,"Stayed in a corner suite with our family of four (2 girls ages 2&4) over July 4th and we loved it. Very family friendly (kids got activity backpacks when we arrived), great kids menu, rooms with bedroom doors that shut and a location close to lots of attractions. It's not super luxurious but nice and when they forgot to clean our room (after 3 phone call reminder / requests) they gave us a generous food credit for the trouble. I would look for other Onmi's for future travel.",nan,nan,ta_s858
trip_advisor,"We stayed one night for a concert at Wrigley Field. The location is excellent. Right off of Michigan Avenue. We chose a king suite which was marginal at best. The room is tired. The carpet was buckled as was the wallpaper. There was a flat screen in the outer room but an old small set in the bedroom. The bath was ok. For the price we were expecting something a lot nicer. However, all of the staff went above and beyond. Torrence at the front desk was especially patient.",nan,nan,ta_s859
trip_advisor,"The Omni is in an excellent location on Michigan, convenient to nearly everything in downtown Chicago. As others have noted, the rooms are starting to appear somewhat dated compared to all of the new and updated hotels in Chicago. That said, our room was very clean and comfortable. I found that the pictures on Omni's website accurately represented our room - more of a plush luxury style than many of the newer hotels' modern/minimalist style. We experienced service that was second to none. The staff was very welcoming and seemed genuinely friendly. I wouldn't hesitate to stay at the Omni the next time I am in Chicago.",nan,nan,ta_s860
trip_advisor,"I was quite pleased with this Omni property, right in the heart of Chicago on the fabulous Magnificent Mile. For an excellent nightly rate of $198 we received a mini suite with living room, bar area, desk and separate bedroom. An incredible value for Memorial Day weekend. The pool/spa area was well appointed and maintained nicely. We found the hotel staff to be very friendly and helpful, and the housekeeping staff superior. The front door/bell staff was always there to help and greeted you with a hello/smile every time you came though the door. Special kudos to Concierge Staff Marcus and Melissa for making our dinner reservations and working out our weekend logistics, they were super!! The only real area for improvement would be the on-site restaurant, we found it under-whelming. Excellent value, nice property, you won't be disappointed with this superior lodging option in a perfect location - great value with superior quality.Restaurant Recommendations:Hugo's Frog House/Gibsons Steakhouse - a Chicago classic steak and seafood house with traditional white coat service. A definite ""old school"" treat, a Chicago institution.The Webber Grille - yes, that's right, the Webber Grille in the garage, they have their own restaurant. Grille fare is outstanding, definitely can taste the grilled goodness, cool place to check out for sure.Table Fifty Two - Run by Oprah's former personal chef (see my separate recommendation), just go there, you will love it, one of the best meals I have ever eaten out!!!!!!!!!!!David Burke's Prime Steakhouse - A prime steak house with some Asian flare to it, meal was delicious, start to finish and it is highly recommended.",nan,nan,ta_s861
trip_advisor,"Stayed here May 9th weekend. Pros: Location is the best on Michigan avenue. The hotel is centrally located to everything. Check in was easy and great. The rooms are very spacious. The bathroom is also very nice with a large sink area. Cons: Instead of 2 small uncomfortable chairs in the room, it would be more functional if the rooms had a sofa. The carpet is also old and worn. The mattress was much too soft and I woke up with a achy back. The TV's are old, especially the one in the bedroom. It is a small CRT TV; not a flat screen. Even the living room TV although a flat screen needs to be updated. Overall hotel was great and I think with just a few updates to the rooms this hotel will be fantastic. Will definitely stay there again!",nan,nan,ta_s862
trip_advisor,"Excellent hotel, great location, staff was very attentive, rooms were immaculate, food was great, we will definitely stay here again. Location was within walking distance of many great restaurants and shopping locations. We arrived early and our room was ready, we were given a late checkout time which really helped. It was my wife's birthday, the hotel sent us a great dessert and bottle of wine, complimentary. Everything was excellent.",nan,nan,ta_s863
trip_advisor,"The Omni was a marvelous experience. We have had many good experiences in the downtown Chicago areabut this was the best in terms of offering a professional and friendly staff, incredibly convenient location (especially if you are having trouble with an Apple product), lovely, spacious rooms where one can read after midnight without disturbing the others, excellent products, and other conveniences such as as abundance of electrical outlets in which to plug the many devices with which we must travel at this point. We were able to secure a wonderful price; we actually could hardly believe our good fortune.",nan,nan,ta_s866
trip_advisor,"The entire staff at the Omni in Chicago was friendly and accommodating. We were tight on time to get to a college open house. The valet listened to our directions and grabbed us a cab. This wonderful valet set the tone for the rest of our very positive experience at the Omni. We made it to our appointment on time. When we returned we were delighted that our belongings were in our room exactly as we had asked. The room was spacious and had a wonderful view of the lake and the city. The room was clean and welcoming. Loved the doors closing off the bedroom area.The view off the pool area was breathtaking. We had breakfast in the morning, and the staff was courteous and took care of all our needs. The views from the restaurant were amazing. We have visited Chicago many times and this is by far the best experience we have had. The Omni will be our first and only choice on future trips to Chicago.",nan,nan,ta_s867
trip_advisor,"I had high expectations for Omni. I found cat feces in the room before checking out. The concierge at the front desk offered breakfast as compensation. After finding Feces, I will not be eating their food, and I will not be staying here again. I paid $300 for a suite to find feces. I wonder what the health department will think when I send them the pictures. I will not return to Omni. The Bar staff is boring, and does not care about their guests. We told the bartender It was my girlfriends 21st birthday, she didn't even get a happy birthday, and then we had to pull teeth from the bartender for her to even help us decide on a drink. I will not return to the Omni again. Do not book with the Omni if you expect any regular amenities that you would get from a Hotel that is not as ""Luxurious"" as the Omni. I've attached the photos of the Feces I found in the room. I would like to add that this is not listed as a pet friendly hotel and I expected a little more cleanliness and class when paying so much for a room.",nan,nan,ta_s868
trip_advisor,"Another great experience staying at this wonderful all-suite hotel ideally located on Michigan Avenue. We chose the special package ""Shop the Mag Mile"" and for the extra money received great value - a $30 dining voucher per adult per day in hotel restaurant, shopping coupons and area map per stay, a $25 Visa gift card per day, and an Omni tote bag...wonderful value. All aspects of the stay were excellent.",nan,nan,ta_s869
trip_advisor,"We stayed at the OMNI for 6 nights in the week before Easter. Weather was colder than we would have liked but the hotel was good choice. Liked the extra room with suite. All the staff were very friendly and helpful. We got a Travellzoo deal that included $30 per day food and beverage voucher. Overall, very happy with our stay here!!",nan,nan,ta_s870
trip_advisor,"Omni all suite hotel is well-located and well-priced. I did not need a suite, but the cost was comparable to other hotels in Chicago where I've stayed before, including the Intercontinental and the Knickerbocker. The key attribute is Service. The front desk had all my paperwork ready when I walked in the door. When I got to my room I found that the freight/employee elevator was audible from my room and I requested a change. Within 10 minutes I was whisked away to a new room, and got help with my bag. Checkout was automatic. No need to do anything. I just joined their Special Guest Program and got free wifi and free coffee delivered to my room. Perfect. I will be back!",nan,nan,ta_s871
trip_advisor,"We are just finishing a three night stay. We have really enjoyed the Omni. The suite was spacious with a large bathroom accessible from both the living and bedrooms. The living area has a wet bar, desk, two chairs and flat screen TV. Our bedroom had a super comfortable king bed with nice sheets and comforter. There is a nice size closet and built-in dresser as well as two night stands. Our stay was super quiet. We were on the 24th floor and looked out over Huron St. and had a nice partial view of Lake Michigan. There are wonderful restaurants within walking distance and the Miracle Mile is right outside the front door. The bathroom is marble and quite spacious. Tere was a great shower with curved shower curtain. The amenities were high quality. We only ate at the hotel for breakfast because we had a $30 credit each day. The buffet contains top quality items and has an omelet station. They also make fresh pancakes and waffles. Ask fro a high floor for the view and also a quiet location.",nan,nan,ta_s872
trip_advisor,"Great location. The all suite provided plenty of space. Hotel staff wonderful and helpful. Our corner room was dated, drafty and loud. Hospitals nearby, ambulance and honking at night. Restaurants and shopping nearby. We were able to walk to the subway, The Sears Tower, now known as the Willis Tower, The Navy Pier and Millennium Park. The Concierge recommended Absolute Segway, an awesome experience.",nan,nan,ta_s873
trip_advisor,The Omni is a great location to walk Chicago. Close to lots of shopping and dining and easy walk to Navy Pier. The accomodations were very clean and updated. Nice suite with seperate bedroom. Bathroom entrance from sitting area and bedroom both. Nice touch is windows that open to let in the fresh air. Employees were all very pleasant and accomodating.,nan,nan,ta_s874
trip_advisor,The Omni Hotels and Resorts have proven to me on multiple times that it represents excellence personified. Very professional and friendly staff!!! I have stayed at the Omni multiple times and I will always want to come back because it's always an awesome experience for me and my family and I've had business meetings at the Omni as well I highly recommend families and business professionals stay there and conduct business there!!!,nan,nan,ta_s875
trip_advisor,"We have a 2 young children that we decided to take the Chicago for a few days. The Omni made what could have been a very stressful trip, very easy. We were very impressed with the valet, front door and bell hop assistance. The room was very clean and quite. The pool was small, but very clean and perfect for our needs. We did the parking package and were very pleased with the services. The hotel is perfectly located in the middle of everything. We only took our car out one time to visit the Museum Campus. We will definitely be returning to the Omni with our family.",nan,nan,ta_s876
trip_advisor,"The Omni Chicago is located in the heart of the shopping and restaurants! I didn't spend a lot of time in the hotel, but I can say that it was clean, spacious, and the staff was friendly. This was my first time in Chicago, so there was so much that I wanted to see. This is my boyfriend's neck of the woods, and everything that he wanted to show me was in walking distance from the hotel! Anyone who is looking for a nice place to stay in Chicago, this location is PRIME!",nan,nan,ta_s877
trip_advisor,"My experience at the Omni was very pleasant. Excellent location, close to business appointments, friendly staff, quiet room/suite, everything you need for a good stay. Very close to the Lakeshore, Mag Mile, shopping, restaurants (& had an EXCELLENT massage at Urban Oasis only blocks away, by Terry). Couple of blocks down from Whole Foods & you could request a frig in your suite. I would recommend & would definitely stay here again.",nan,nan,ta_s878
trip_advisor,"We stayed at the Omni for a spring break to Chicago. The location was perfect. We got a suite for the 4 of us. The pool was nice and the exercise room had cold water, cold towels, and ear phones for the tvs. Wonderful. The housekeeping, conceraige, and front desk staff were awesome! We loved out experience. The girls loved the cookies and milk at bedtime too. Would stay again in a heart beat!",nan,nan,ta_s879
trip_advisor,"I have to admit that when I first walked into the building, the small area that I thought was the lobby had me skeptical. HOWEVER I soon realized that due to the cramped downtown area, the lobby was actually on the 6th floor, and extremely clean and welcoming. The staff and manager were professional and very friendly. The suite was very roomy and comfortable. I wished that I had stumbled upon this place earlier so we could spend the whole weekend there! Truly felt like a vacation...even though I'm a Chicago resident.",nan,nan,ta_s880
trip_advisor,"This is a very good location.....just across from Nordstrom's and other shopping as well as close to many good restaurants. Beds are comfortable and it is nice to have a small kitchen area especially when staying for several nights. Rooms and furniture are getting a bit tired. My experience with the staff was less than great, unfortunately. I was surprised when a custodial employee entered my room without knocking to tell me that my credit card was declined and my keys didn't work anymore. No calls, no knock on the door? The front desk staff assumed that my credit card had been declined, when in fact their system went down and lost my information. The manager of the hotel promised to investigate, but never got back to me. This type of service is why the hotel is average at best!However, Amer and his staff at the valet are top notch!",nan,nan,ta_s881
trip_advisor,"First the good things. The location is good within walking distance of city center offices. Rooms are nice.There is a gym with a nice view on the 19th Floor. And the breakfast is fine. Nice valet service at the reception. Not so good: Passages look kind of old and dingy. Bad : I got charged for 3 days more than 1 stayed. I called up 3 times. No one has replied as yet. I am disappointed by this service especially because thus far, I have always liked staying at Homewoods properties.",nan,nan,ta_s882
trip_advisor,"I've been coming down to Chicago with my family for the past 8 years and this is the first year we decided to stay the night and make it a two day event. I'm glad I booked at this hotel! Very accomodating and the rooms are spacious, clean and the front desk is very curteous! We were able to stop in early and drop our bags off so we didn't have to carry them around Chicago the whole day while we waited for our rooms to get ready. That was above and beyond of what we expected. One of the rooms needed a baby crib and that was brought up as soon as we got checked into our room. Beds were super comfy! Fluffy pillows and not to mention a really great breakfast the next morning! If you want to have a little getaway in downtown Chicago, then I would gladly recommend this hotel for you. We will definitely be back next year or even this summer for a little trip! Thank you for the hospitality! :-)",nan,nan,ta_s883
trip_advisor,"From the beginning our stay here was very good. ""Sal"", the leader of the valet crew, was so personable and friendly. He introduced himself and called me by name on each interaction. The staff was pleasant. The wifi was a little suspect at times. The ""pent house"" pool was unbelievable. It was truly like swimming with the skyscrapers. The hotel is perfectly situated just a couple blocks from the Magnificent Mile with other shopping and restaurants within blocks. Definitely recommend this hotel. If you're bringing a car make sure and get the Parking special!",nan,nan,ta_s884
trip_advisor,"We stayed 3 nights in a 1BR suite on the 12th floor. Got an amazing deal at $120/night which included parking with in/out, so I really wasn't expecting all that much... But everything was great - location was awesome, valets were attentive and prompt, front desk was personable and efficient, online check in was slick, breakfast was plentiful and tasty. Having a full kitchen was nice; we had dinner delivered one night, so it was great to have real dishes, glasses, cutlery, etc. We would totally stay here again!",nan,nan,ta_s885
trip_advisor,Went on a business trip and stayed here for a little over a week. The room location was great with a view of the Lake and a 2 minute walk to Michigan Ave. Room was comfortable and clean. Hotel is quite large and there are a lot of amenities it has to offer. I normally prefer a smaller quieter hotel in the area. That is my only real disappointment is that it is too busy for me. Restaurant serves good food at hotel prices.,nan,nan,ta_s887
trip_advisor,"I searched and searched and searched for a hotel in Chicago having never been. I came upon this hotel by accident as I was researching. I was very surprised and pleased with the value of the hotel. I had no idea what I had found until I arrived. The location is absolutely perfect with so many great things to do within walking distance. Another great surprise was the delicious complementary breakfast. This is not a Holiday Inn breakfast mind you. This is a full hot breakfast buffet. What really sold me on this hotel was the availability of having this suite. In the outer area, the sitting area, my son could stay up and watch TV late and I could go into the other room close the doors and go to bed early if I needed. This was a great set up for our family. I highly recommend this hotel and the next time I come back to Chicago, this is where I'll stay.",nan,nan,ta_s888
trip_advisor,"My sister and I stay 3 nights annually to shop and enjoy the city. Awesome location across from Shops at North Bridge. It is surrounded by Eatily, Joe's, Shake Shack, and numerous shops and restaurants. We've never used the valet service, but the doormen are helpful, pleasant and knowledgeable about nearby offerings. The rooms are large and fully stocked; just a call to the front desk has always gotten us quick service with anything extra we need. The beds are SO comfortable! The bedding/bath towels look fresh and new. The housekeeping staff keep the rooms and common areas free of debris and are readily available. We have moved the dates of our annual trip to include more weekdays to take advantage of the complementary dinner. As another reviewer stated, the selection is pre-determined, but I've never been disappointed with the quantity or quality of the items I've eaten. (Certainly, it's a savings of well over $50 for my sister and I to use for shopping instead of eating!) Breakfast is also good to start our day. 4 stars instead of 5 are due to a couple of things: the pool needs a little more regular attention (floating debris the last time we tried swimming), the WiFi is spotty at best, and the rooms, while large enough, are in need of some updating. Carpet & kitchen cabinetry show signs of wear. Some re-grouting wouldn't hurt in the bathrooms, too. Thank you for a dependable place to call home when in Chicago!!",nan,nan,ta_s889
trip_advisor,"We stayed here Thanksgiving weekend to celebrate our 15 yrs together..We were surprised to find a nice bottle of wine, along with a nice note in the room on arrival. We were very impressed.. We found the staff helpful and pleasant.. Check-in was efficient. The rooms were spacious and very clean.. The bedding was extremely comfortable... Breakfast was crowded but with lots of choices. This property is in an excellent location for taking on Chicago by foot or public transportation. We would definitely stay here again.",nan,nan,ta_s890
trip_advisor,"Stayed here after a great stay at the Homewood Suites in Harrisburg.We took the Subway / L from Midway Airport so we didn't need to pay for parking.I was happy with my week long stay but there are few issues that we came across. Breakfast & Dinner were busy and at one point there was a wait. We adjusted our routine so that we came early to avoid the busy times. Elevator was also slow and busy every time we went to use it. Everything else was great. The bed & room was great size, WIFI was adequate, all the staff we spoke to were nice. Breakfast & Dinner had a nice varity.",nan,nan,ta_s891
trip_advisor,"We stayed here this week and I must say, spend a little more and stay at the Embassy Suites. The rooms are much larger for more than two people. This room was very cramped, but we wanted to try a different Hilton this trip. The breakfast and dinner was average, the staff were very nice.The pull out bed in the very cramped living room was very uncomfortable. The dishes were dirty with lipstick stains on them in the cabinet. The king bed was very comfortable, love the pillows.",nan,nan,ta_s892
trip_advisor,"The first impression at the ground Floor is somewhat mixed, as you have to take the lift to the 6 Th Floor for the reception. However the personel is very helpfull and the Suites are big with 2 Panasonic flatscreens, a full kitchen and place to work and relax.In the morning there is a free breakfast with varying composition of good quality and fresh ingredients. And there is a good strong coffee, quite exceptional in the US.The rooms are quiet and clean . At the reception drinks and even Bread can be bought, nice service when you are on business in a big city.On one evening I used the free dinner service with free drinks, even beer , and this appeared also of good quality and just what you need on a cold november night in Chicago.",nan,nan,ta_s893
trip_advisor,"I went with a group and every time we need support from the crew of the front desk they were rude and careless with our problems.The reservation was wrong, they missed packages delivered and they don't pay attention to the guests.Location is good, rooms clean and concierge helps a lot. But the front desk is terrible. The space of the breakfast is also small for the size of the hotel.Next year I will come back but this hotel lost my group.",nan,nan,ta_s894
trip_advisor,"The Homewood Suites is the place to stay if you are traveling as a family. They offer a full breakfast and dinner many nights. The meals are included for up to 4 in a room. The suites are small, a bit run down, but very comfortable. The staff couldn't be nicer. The location is very convenient to Michigan Avenue, walking to the river and lake and public transportation. The breakfasts were very good, offering lots of choices including hot and cold meal choices. However, due to the large number of families with kids there was a wait, or you had to bring food back to your room. The hotel is very quiet. My husband and I stayed at the Homewood Suites over Thanksgiving which might explain how crowded it was. If you are traveling as a couple, you might consider a different hotel that is a little less hectic, especially during holidays or school vacations.",nan,nan,ta_s895
trip_advisor,"We stayed here recently for. Family Thanksgiving trip. Overall we were happy with the service and rooms. The rooms were definitely no frills, not as nice as some other extended stays that we have stayed at in Chicago, but the location is great. One issue that could be a deal breaker, though, was the breakfast and dinner service. The lines were horrible, which can be hard to deal with when small children are involved. We continued to have this problem no matter what time we tried to eat. Most of the time there was no place to sit and most food items were empty. Still up on the air as to whether we would stay again, as the good piece is very important to us with small children. With that being said, it was a holiday weekend and very busy.",nan,nan,ta_s896
trip_advisor,"Two of my grandchildren and I stayed here the weekend following Thanksgiving and it was a truly wonderful experience! Starting with the valet staff at street level to the reception desk to the management to the staff in the eating area, we were always greeted with friendly smiles and kindness. My youngest grandson enjoyed the fact that he shared his name (Alex) with Alejandro at the front desk and the manager (Marcus) gave the kids free snacks when we were rooting around in the snack room. My grandson lost his brand new sunglasses just before we left and Selena helped us locate them in the breakfast room. There are just not enough words to say how wonderful the staff is at this hotel.The hotel itself is in a marvelous location downtown and we were greeted by a welcome fire in the fireplace at check-in. The elevators are a bit slow, but I believe the hotel was probably very crowded as evidenced by the number of people at breakfast. The breakfast selection is enormous by the standards of normal hotel free breakfasts. Eggs, sausage, biscuits, gravy, waffles, cereal, fruit, juices, hot oatmeal, toast on the first day with pancakes instead of waffles on the second day. The rooms aren't very large, but it was plenty of room for the 3 of us! I loved having a kitchen so we could make popcorn or mini pizzas without having to go out and brave the crowds in the restaurants. The rooms have a full-size refrigerator. The kids loved the pool area and the fitness room next door looked well stocked with equipment.This is a place I would stay again and again.",nan,nan,ta_s897
trip_advisor,"I have to begin by mentioning the very friendly, attentive staff. This is a very family-oriented hotel. The breakfasts were crowded with lots of kids. The suites are pretty small and filled with furniture. I'd prefer one big room over three small rooms - very little open space. The location is very convenient to the Miracle Mile and lots of great restaurants. We were traveling as a couple and I would not recommend staying here as a couple - spend a few more bucks on the Hampton Inn or Embassy Suites. But it's a great spot for young families.",nan,nan,ta_s898
trip_advisor,Like so many have mentioned the location is great close proximity to shopping and dining tourist attractions if you're interested in that. The rooms were clean and well appointed they had a good breakfast. it's your basic Homewood Suites we're not talking about a five star hotel here but I have to say it felt like more than just a Homewood Suites and I think a lot of that has to do with their staff they were all extremely friendly they really put in effort to make my stay as comfortable as possible.,nan,nan,ta_s899
trip_advisor,"Although it was only a 1 night flight thru O'hare, I chose this property because of it's high rating vs. the airport hotels didn't have the same. I wasn't disappointed. It's a good 35 minute commute from airport to the hotel, but as the property is not in the heart of downtown. traffic is a bit less.The lobby is on a higher floor, not the first, and valet parking is mandatory + pricey (over 55$ a day) , but that is Chicago downtown for you. The staff are very friendly and I was upgraded in accord with my Diamond Status.The room was older but very comfortable. It had a living room and bedroom, both very clean but a tad small. The bed was comfortable and I slept well that night.The bathroom had a tub shower and stingy water pressure due to the high floor and those frustrating water conservation shower heads. Some day hotels will measure how much extra water people use to compensate for the reduced water of the ""green"" devices and chuck them. Upon check out the next morning, too early sadly, the staff were also very polite and offered no surprises on the bill.I recommend this property and would gladly stay there the next time I am in Chicago.",nan,nan,ta_s900
trip_advisor,"There was a fire in our home, and we needed a place to stay FAST. We booked Homewood Suites Downtown Chicago at 40 E. Grand Close to my office, and they allow dogs! The staff booking over the phone was easy and quick, and they were most empathetic. Everything was made easy, from arrival through arranging a late check out this afternoon. Amer and the rest of the door staff were always prompt in getting my car, handling luggage and boxes as we attempted to rescue stuff from our apartment each day; and they took a real liking to our 17 year old golden retriever. :-)Lorena and the rest of the front desk staff were helpful and kind; as were the housekeeping and maintenance staff who took great care of us.Breakfast included each morning was hot and tasty.We are very grateful to have landed here in our moment of tragedy. These people know the meaning of hospitality!",nan,nan,ta_s901
trip_advisor,"Stayed at the Homewood Suites last weekend and very much enjoy our visit and stay at the hotel is in a great location. Hotel is a few blocks off Miracle Mile but yet near Macys and may and many stores and restaurants. Hotel is easy one mile or less walk from the South Shore train that we took to Chicago from Michigan City, IN. Breakfast was good with more selections than your cheaper chain hotels. We heard almost nothing at night while in our room so the walls are pretty thick and sound proof. Only reason I did not give it a 5 rating was because our room was a corner room and was very small. I looked at other rooms and they were bigger. Avoid room 1505 or corner rooms. Very please with our stay and would stay again. Nice job Homewood.",nan,nan,ta_s902
trip_advisor,"Honestly, we chose this hotel because it was a little cheaper, and offered free breakfast. We were VERY satisfied. The bell station staff were courteous, helpful and very attentive. Breakfast had a good variety and staff were attentive to keeping tables clean. Room was very clean and we were happy with accommodations. We would recommend this hotel, and would choose Homewood again because of the service and value that we received.",nan,nan,ta_s903
trip_advisor,"The location can't be beat, shares a building with Eataly, half a block from the red line, excellent neighborhood. The suites are smaller and more run down than the Hampton suites down the street. Our room had a broken kitchen cabinet, sheets that barely covered the mattress, and the bedroom didn't have space for our luggage. Overall it was a tolerable stay but wish we had booked at the Hampton for similar rate but better hotel.",nan,nan,ta_s904
trip_advisor,"Stayed here as was in town for a conference. This location gave me a better rate than the conference hotel, which was right next door. Arrived early and the room was ready. (Photos of room 1103 submitted.) While the furniture was a bit worn, the bed was comfortable and it was nice to have a separate living area from the bedroom. Housekeeping did a good job daily. The complimentary breakfasts were good, although the area was consistently busy. Did not try the complimentary dinners. Visited the pool to see it. It looked inviting. No whirlpool/hot tub. Overall, a good value for the money and a great location (near Magnificent Mile)!",nan,nan,ta_s905
trip_advisor,"We booked this hotel because it was a great location and amazing deal for a large suite - which is always high on our wish list when traveling with our 3 kids ages 2, 4 & 5. But, despite the value, I would not recommend this place to anyone. The entire hotel is serviced by two small elevators, and the main lobby/dining room is several floors up, so the elevators get a LOT of use. I honestly can't quite believe that the system is up to code, with so many demands on so few lifts. The TINY street level anteroom is always unbelievably crowded with people waiting for cars and cabs and elevators, it is extremely ungracious. There is a TON of ""free"" food - but it's REALLY bad. Really, really bad. But apparently people like it because the dining room is very crowded, and it's impossible to get a table during peak breakfast hours. Anyway - the location is nice and convenient, and it's definitely a low cost option. But, despite the low price, I wouldn't say it's a good value - it's a very cheap experience.",nan,nan,ta_s906
trip_advisor,"This hotel was in a great location, across from high end shops and within walking distance or a short cab ride to many of Chicago's landmark attractions: Navy Pier, Millennium Park. It was easy to get to from the Red Line, so we walked or utilized public transit. The amenities were valuable. We took advantage of the weeknight manager's dinner and daily breakfast buffet. The staff was friendly. Hotel rooms are on the 7th floor and above, which lessens the city noise, and offers skyscraper views. The rooms have the traditional spacious layout, including kitchenette, but finishes are older.",nan,nan,ta_s907
trip_advisor,"After canceling a reservation prior to the cut off date (3 days prior to stay) and told that there would be no charge for the room, we were billed on our credit card the full price of the room. We even changed our location to another Hilton hotel for the same nights a few blocks away. When we informed them they said we never cancelled. When we talked to Hilton guest services, they confirmed that it was cancelled, but could do nothing about the charge - that needed to be handled by the site management. We have been trying to contact the site for 3+ weeks and have not heard from them. AVOID THIS HOTEL IF YOU STAY IN CHICAGO! Terrible customer service and criminal behavior is the norm!",nan,nan,ta_s908
trip_advisor,"Little worn and dated interior, but comfy bed, and AMAZING Views of the downtown, Wrigley Building, Trump Tower. THREE big windows in the corner king suite of this building. From a person who is not from the city, this was a real treat, the views we had. Pretty quiet and no issues with it other than that the morning of the marathon, there was a strange noise that started around 8:30am. Very loud, like a plumbing or HVAC noise, don't know. We left right after that. If I had been sleeping in, I would've been mad, but we left, so I didn't care anymore. The location was great for the marathon, went right past the building. Included breakfast, hot, but nothing to write home about. I ate it anyway because I am always hungry :) Also, even with only having my mom and I on the trip, it is really nice to have the two room thing, so worth it! fridge, sink, separate room for tv or looking at city, etc. Location very very convenient. If you have money to spend, Joe's seafood/steak place on the corner, excellent! Also, I guess they have dinners during the week. we weren't there then so I can't vouch for it, but nice to have it offered.",nan,nan,ta_s909
trip_advisor,Got a good rate for my corner room and was very happy. Breakfast had many choices though I like just yogurt with fruit. The dinner that is included with your room Mon. -Thurs. was good and they had free wine and beer too. Came in handy to have dinner early when we had to get ready for the theater. The staff at this hotel is excellent.,nan,nan,ta_s910
trip_advisor,"I only have positve notes for this hotel:-great room (we had a magnificent view from the 34th and 35th floor)-very clean, laundry service quick and not too pricey-breakfast absolutely satisfying-great staff (especially Nicole from the front desk- she was so friendly and kind and always eager to help!) -great location!!! We stayed there during the IMTS and recommend this hotel for both business and leisure! Thank you so much for a great few days in Chicago!",nan,nan,ta_s911
trip_advisor,"It was a nice hotel in a place where you want to be located. Like a tiny 1 bedroom with a small full kitchen, large bathroom that's separated (sink outside the door). The furnishings were out of the 70s and both loveseat and chair were uncomfortable in the living room. Hard to bend around to see the TV, but being near everything it was nice to have a kitchen with tiny dining table. Lobby is on the 6th floor and the service is lacking. Not that bad, just not there.",nan,nan,ta_s912
trip_advisor,"The location is perfect, in the heart of the city at walking distance from all the good stuff that Chicago offers.The room has good space, it is like an one bedroom apartment with a little kitchen and a living room.The windows are sound proof, you can't hear anything from the streets.The only reason for the four stars instead of five was the shower. The water doesn't come with much pressure, but I could live with that.",nan,nan,ta_s913
trip_advisor,"The staff members were extremely nice! The beds were comfortable, however, the pull out sofa wasn't acceptable. The sofa and chair were very old, dirty, and uncomfortable. The carpet was actually damp in some places and had a mildew smell. The hot breakfast was excellent but on the weekends, I feel like a 7:00 am start time is too late; 6:00 am would be more appropriate. The location is great but I don't plan on staying at this property again while in Chicago.",nan,nan,ta_s915
trip_advisor,"Yes, the rugs are scuffed, but for this business traveler who likes to do her own real cooking, it was awesome. Full refrigerator, knives that cut, stovetop, plates, bowls, even a couple of microwave cooking dishes. One block from a Trader Joes and less from Eataly. The atmosphere in the elevator/dining room/halls was like family camp, kids running everywhere, the staff very helpful. The rooms completely quiet, the views out the window of the neighboring skyscrapers uplifting. Neighborhood is in central downtown near Michigan Ave shopping strip, but it doesn't feel noisy or oppressive. Lovely to have a separate bedroom and a decent-sized living room and kitchen too. Business ctr. for printing out boarding passes. Could have used a desk, but can't have everything. Check in is on the 6th floor. I passed on the meals, they looked like camp food. Not glamorous, but a nice place to hang and met my needs perfectly. Check out the Millennium Park at the Art Institute while you're there. I used Uber to get around and loved it.",nan,nan,ta_s916
trip_advisor,"Came into town for a short stay (three nights) but the kitchen came in handy. Traveling with four kids (under 10) can have it's challenges but the pool and ""roomy"" room made it that much easier. The staff were Wonderful. Sal was a great asset. He always made sure we were pointed in the right direction, was a wealth of knowledge and made our family feel welcome. We all enjoyed a plentyful breakfast before heading out for the day. The location was perfect. Lots of great shopping and dining within walking distance. The train was near by as well. Wouldn't think of staying anywhere else.",nan,nan,ta_s917
trip_advisor,"The hotel is clean and in the heart of downtown....close to everything. They offer a complimentary breakfast which was below average. They had a waffle bar which was awesome, but the eggs, sausage, potatoes, and other options were subpar. I was also disappointed they didn't offer complimentary wi-fi...or at the very least ethernet ports in the rooms. I consider that a must in this day and age. The staff were extremely friendly and helpful.",nan,nan,ta_s918
trip_advisor,"Seriously. I LOVE that the bedroom is separate from the living/sitting room (TVs in each, what a nice amenity). Wonderful king size bed. Fully equipped kitchen including dishwasher. BIG living space. Good free breakfast; excellent service, especially the valet car service. Within walking distance of Art Institute, The Egg, Millenium Park, the Magnificent Mile--truly outstanding experience, especially for the price.",nan,nan,ta_s919

The staff is very friendly, caring and the rooms are very clean. The food was Mmmm good. We are planing on returning later in the year. Upon checking out at 3:00 am, we were greeted by a really nice gentleman named, Noel. He gave us hot tea for our long ride back home to N.J...The Thomas's",nan,nan,ta_s921
trip_advisor,"My 5yr old son and I traveled to Chicago for our first time and stayed here over a weekend. Amer and his staff went out of their way to make us comfortable. They were always smiling, cheerful and willing to help. I will definitely stay here next time we travel to Chicago and look for other Homewood Suites to stay at in other cities. Their complementary breakfast (Mon-Thurs) was a real breakfast (eggs, meat, toast, bagels, cereal, potatoes, etc.) served as a buffet. They also offer complementary dinner Mon-Thurs, which we were unable to attend. If you are looking for a good restaurant I highly recommend Joe's, right next to the hotel.",nan,nan,ta_s922

(right off Michigan Ave in the heart of the city)Room size for family of 3Hot breakfast included (saved some money here)Views from upper floors are lovelyCons-Internet times out every 10 minutes (very frustrating when watching Netflix)TV lost reception on channels periodically (particularly in the upper channels)Parking is valet only and $55 a day (we found cheaper self-parking within a block)Overall, the stay was enjoyable and we will likely rebook at this location in the future.",nan,nan,ta_s923
trip_advisor,"Stayed here with my husband and two kids (age 9,7). This hotel was perfect. It was easy to get to by L or bus. Free hot breakfast was actually really good. There was a full kitchen and a grocery store just a few blocks away. The rooms are very nice, comfortable and clean. The indoor pool on the upper floor is surrounded by windows with views of downtown. Price was good too. We'll definitely stay here again.",nan,nan,ta_s924

This hotel represents my kind of town Chicago, great hospitality, friendly staff, and pleasant time. I have never had any unpleasant moment at this hotel. I just have to emphasize that all the hotel staff there are just great, friendly, and helpful, especially Marcus! You are an amazing manager and helped me through the unfortunate accident and made this time stay greater than it can be. It is the people who make your stay more than perfect and give you such wonderful time. I do not own the address in Chicago anymore but this hotel is my home in Chicago. I am sure that you will love the hotel when you once stay there.",nan,nan,ta_s925
trip_advisor,This hotel is the best value in Chicago. They were attentive and helpful and you couldn't ask for a better rate in such a fantastic location. We had a sick infant while there and didn't want to go out into the sub zero Chicago weather when he had a fever. We used their grocery service and they brought us back diapers and infant tylenol for no additional up charge. It was a great service and much appreciated! I will definitely stay there again.,nan,nan,ta_s926

We definitely recommend this hotel, and will come back and stay here again. thank you",nan,nan,ta_s927
trip_advisor,"Excellent location, excellent rooms and the most fantastic staff I have ever come across on our holidays to USA. They were exceptional. The breakfasts were are a good start to the day and the pool on the 19th floor was great for either an early morning or late evening swim. It was always empty during our stay Oct/Nov. We asked for a corner suite and the view at night was amazing! The chamber maid Marianna did an excellent job. We loved our stay at this hotel!",nan,nan,ta_s928

Mr. Amer greeted me every morning with a smile a quickly called a taxi for me, allowing me to spend minimal time in subzero temps. Lorena at the front desk was able to accommodate all of my requests and had some great restaurant recommendations! Connie always greater me with a smile and laugh at breakfast and made me feel welcome with friendly conversation. Thank you staff of Homewood. I will definitely be staying here whenever possible!",nan,nan,ta_s929
trip_advisor,"This was my first time staying at this hotel. I loved the location - close to shopping, a choice of restaurants, and even a movie theater - and the staff was great. I had a room on the top floor (19th) and enjoyed the view. The exercise room was also on the top floor and offered a great view of the city while working out. There was also a pool which I'll need to take advantage of next time I stay there. My room was very clean and had a lot of nice amenities in the kitchen. I liked the abundance of plugs for my computer and chargers. The bed was really comfy. I had a little surprise one morning with a window cleaner dangling outside, but that's why you keep your curtains closed! I'm definitely staying here again.",nan,nan,ta_s930
trip_advisor,"This hotel is centrally located, just a block off the magnificent mile and a block from the Grand red line stop. You can get anywhere very quickly. The rooms are suites with a kitchen, bedroom and living room. The kitchen which makes it nice for leftovers from the many area restaurants you will want to try. There is a nice breakfast everyday with make your own waffles (this area can sometimes be chaotic with rookie waffle makers!), pastries, bagels. yogurt, fresh fruit, scrambled eggs, a breakfast meat that changes and a potato that changes. They also serve dinner and drinks during the week. It was also nice to have coffee and tea always available in the lobby. It was a cold week and this was a nice stop on the way up to the room. The staff is very nice and really seem to care that you enjoy your stay. There is a nice but small pool on the 19th floor, stocked with towels. It is a great view while swimming. This is one of our favorite places to stay in Chicago for the location, extra touches and value.",nan,nan,ta_s931
trip_advisor,"We have started staying at homewood suites with our two kids (9 & 11) because the suites give us plenty of room. This location & hotel were awesome mostly because of the service! From the valet to the front desk to the housekeeping to the breakfast, everyone was so accommodating and kind. Amer and the valet team were great and the front desk found me a phone charger and charged my phone when I needed it. They had dvds and games for the kids and my son loved the 24 hour hot cocoa too :) Great location!",nan,nan,ta_s932
trip_advisor,"We stayed here for about a month because of a house fire. From the minute we checked in with Starr at the front desk, to our first breakfast with Connie offering a warm smile, it made a bad circumstance better. Monica made sure our room was clean and Amir and the valet team were very accommodating. We enjoyed staying here! excellent location. The only improvement would be better internet connection.",nan,nan,ta_s933
trip_advisor,"Our first visit to Chicago downtown. Driving into the location from the west seemed a little convoluted and busy as we are from a small town in Iowa and not use to the hustle and bustle of a big city. Even though, once in downtown, the hotel was easy to find, and with valet service, our vehicle drop off was was quick and convenient. Our stay was for two nights. Check-in was located on the 6th floor away from the small entry way into the hotel on the ground floor. Staff was exremely helpful, polite and conversational during our stay. We were able to walk to areas around the hotel to various convenience stores, bars and restuarants. Streets were crowded and seemed safe enough during normal daytime and evening hours. We attended a Chicago Cubs game on the second day, and took the ""red line"" train to Wrigley from about two blocks away from our hotel....very convenient and inexpensive. The ride was not unduly long. Enjoyed the comp breakfast each morning, although it was extremely busy and required a short wait the first day. The meal was OK, but could have been much better with a higher quality and variety of meat product (link sausage both day). Prices of the room seemed high, but probably because we are not use to spending about $250 per night. That did include a valet parking charge of $42 per night which I understood was competitive for the downtown area. Check-out was a breeze, and with our GPS system, getting on track to the route back home was relatively easy.",nan,nan,ta_s935
trip_advisor,"My wife and I frequent Chicago about every 3 to 5 years. We like to stay downtown so we can walk to just about everything, and we like to stay places that apprecaite customer service.We hit the jackpot this time.What was supposed to be a weekend birthday get away turned into a reunion of friends and family, and thanks to Daniel of Homewood Suites, the event went off like a charm.As far as the hotel, it's in a super location...the only place you would need to get transportaton to visit would be Wrigley Field or the Museum of Science and Industry....everything else you can (and should) walk to from here. Also, the rooms are suites, so they are spacious and comfortable. The entire Property is very clean and well maintained. All the staff throughout our 3 night stay were awesome....from the bell staff, to the desk, to the cleaning staff. Everyone was friendly...and everyone was good at their roles. I've stayed at 6 or 7 other properities in the area through the years, and no one has ever taken as good of care of us as the people here. Thanks Daniel et al for a memorable stay.",nan,nan,ta_s936
trip_advisor,"The location of this hotel is wonderful. Close to all the major attractions. A very walkable city with friendly people overall. We were greeted upon arrival, our bags were taken and our car parked. The staff (especially Amer and Noah and Connie) are fabulous. I had read about Amer on this site so I asked for him. He was not there at the time but the next morning he greeted with such a friendly smile and suggestions for our day. Whoever trains this staff has done a great job. Connie runs the dining room in the morning in that same friendly professional way. We always choose Hilton properties for our travel because of the amenities. Having a great breakfast is a way to save money. This was the first time we took advantage of the dinner (we normally travel on weekends), and that was also great. Thank you for making our trip to Chicago such a success. Also a great pool area.",nan,nan,ta_s937
trip_advisor,"The location is terrific, that's all. Read carefully: The hotel entrance lobby (extremely small) on 40 East Grand is on the ground level but registration and formal lobby is on the 6th floor! Only two elevators, very slow and overcrowded, take all the clients to floors 6 to 19. Valet staff didn't acknowledge us, possible language barrier. 6th floor registration area and lobby is large with 24 hr coffee/tea, a little store with snacks and other refreshments and sundries. Nice seating and large touch screen computer to check local attractions, restaurants, etc. That was nice! Registration went smoothly and said our room was a corner unit and would be much larger for our party. I was excited and hopeful that the rest of my experience would be nice. Not so. I wrote that service, value and rooms as poor because we asked for towels and didn't get them. We asked twice. Finally got towels from a late night security guard and had to raid a cart for supplies such as toilet paper and coffee. Elevators were a problem throughout our stay. Room was surprisingly small with narrow sitting room/kitchen area, door to average king bedroom, adjoining tiny bathroom sink area and door to absurdly large tub/shower, toilet room. Ceiling on shower wall was cracked and peeling from water damage. Kitchen was equipped but several cabinet doors couldn't open because of placement of appliances. Air Conditioning worked well. Breakfast staff and valet staff offered little to no customer service. Breakfast served on 6th floor - standard fare with small hot selection and make your own small waffles. Seating ample but staff made you give your room number and wait till they seated you as if they were a restaurant. Took my breakfast to my room because I didn't want to wait 1/2 hour to sit for crummy buffet. Food served 5 - 7 pm was gross but crowded because it was free with wine and beer served from communal carafe and tap. Chose not to eat at the evening buffet. Indoor Pool on 19th floor nice but heavily chlorinated and burned my eyes without swimming. Gym looked nice but didn't use the facility. Used the business center. Large center console meeting desk - perimeter with several computers to check your e-mails and print boarding passes. Plenty of pamphlets for all local attractions. There was a sign that said, 'If we can do anything to make your stay better, let us know"". Well, they can't increase the size of the ground floor lobby or the number of elevators or reconfigure the size of my room. However, they should re-evaluate the furniture which was old with flattened cushions. I couldn't pull out the sofa bed because of the size of the room and its position from the tv cabinet. It's not my job to move all the hotel furniture just so I can sleep. They can however work immediately on their customer service skills and reconfigure their breakfast location and menu. I think that the location is great but for your money stay around the corner at the Embassy Suites on State and Ohio. Brighter, nicer, working elevators, large rooms, just as convenient, excellent breakfast and service. Sorry Hilton, but as a Hilton Member you failed to make my grade.",nan,nan,ta_s938
trip_advisor,"Stayed there for a week. Family holiday and first time in Chicago. Basically it's a suites hotel, but we basically wanted a base from which we could explore the city. With this in mind, the location was excellent. Almost everything we wanted to see was within walking distance as we're a range of good restaurants and of course the shops! We hardly used any public transport.The suite itself (for 3adults) was fine, one bedroom and a pull down bed in the living area and a good well equipped kitchen area. Shower, air conditioning and cleanliness were excellent, linen change on 3 days. Staff were friendly and helpful.Breakfast was a buffet and was adequate if limited and the breakfast room was small so there was generally a waiting time but this did not really worry us. Tea & coffee available at all times.Swimming pool was a great asset to refresh at the end of the day.We would use Homewood again - it's not a hotel but fit the bill for us.J C",nan,nan,ta_s939
trip_advisor,"This was our 1st stay at a Homewood Suites Hotel since we usually find Hilton Gardens a good value when we travel. I was very surprised at how well run this hotel was during our week's stay.As others have said, the hotel is located right off Michigan Ave in the heart of downtown. Steps away from pubic transportation and within walking distance of dozens of restaurants and most of the city's main tourist attractions. We didn't need a car at all and a good thing since downtown traffic is what you would expect and parking rates very high.I keep my review short by just pointing out the hotel's positives and a few negatives.   o Excellent location in downtown Chicago o. Free (hot buffet) daily with fresh scrambled eggs, sausage, bagels, hot/cold cereals, juice, etc. o Well run breakfast dining room o. Quiet and clean rooms with nice city views and updated kitchens o. Proximity to bus and subway (made it to Wrigley Field in about 30 minutes). o. Well trained, friendly, and helpful staff o. Reasonably pricedA few negatives: o. Hotel only has two elevators - so waiting times can be long during tourist season o. Predominately families were staying here during our stay - this created long lines in the  breakfast room and at the elevators. While families have found this a good value hotel,  business travelers and couples may find this a negative.Travel Tip: Cab fare from O'Hare will run about $40 - $50 depending on time of day. Took the Blue Line located in the airport terminal right into downtown Chicago for $5 and saved a lot of money while also avoiding rush hour traffic.",nan,nan,ta_s940
trip_advisor,"We chose this hotel because we are a family of 5 and this is one of the only hotels that offer a suite with two completely separate rooms, the kids in one room and the parents in the bedroom.Upon arrival we were greeted by very friendly valet staff who helped us with our bags and getting the kids out of the car. However, it took our bags nearly an hour to make it to our room and that included the all-important diaper bag. After a 7 hr car ride we were in desperate need of that bag. Rooms were smaller than expected and pretty dated but not horrible, just not nice either. Don't expect too much from the decor and you won't be disappointed. The hotels' location is in a good location, literally 10 minutes straight down to Navy Pier. The free breakfast was gross, seriously yucky. Again, don't expect too much, even our 10 yr old thought it was gross and he eats almost anything. We found it very irritating that the room's garbages were not changed the second day, and travelling with 3 kids, 2 of which are in diapers, this is gross and not what we expected...the room SMELLED like dirty diapers when we returned to our around 6pm that night. The third day was much worse. We returned to the room again around 5 ish, and again the room had not been cleaned. It smelled horrible. We had called the front desk in the morning and asked for dish detergent be sent up to our room that morning, but never received any. We had to call down again upon our return and finally just took some off one of the cleaning staffs carts. As we were discussing dinner plans we received a knock at our door and it was a herd of cleaning staff telling us they needed to clean our room NOW. I asked if they could return in half an hour and they said No, they were done for the day and needed to get in to clean. They retreated and told us they'd be back in 15 minutes, but instead came back after 5 mins, barged in, walking directly into the bedroom Without knocking while I was getting dressed. I had to hurry my family out of the room (try doing that with. 10 yr old, a 2 yr old and. 7mth old, not easy). Again, NOT HAPPY.We returned later that night and noticed that the fire alarm was beeping. We called the front desk and asked to have someone come up to change the battery because it appeared to be low. We stressed that we were trying to put the kids to bed and to please hurry. They sent someone up who replaced the fire alarm but guess what started beeping again soon after?!We were very unhappy with the service, they were slow and disinterested in making the customer happy (with the exception of the valet staff, they were great). Sigh, needless to say, we will not be returning.",nan,nan,ta_s941

They were also very pleasant with my kids. Great job! This hotel as recommended to us by my colleagues and they apologized for the poor quality in food. They had stayed at this hotel about 3 or 4 years ago and they raved about the quality of the food at breakfast and the reception. This was not the case this trip. My kids liked the waffle station and I liked the coffee. The dinners were of poor quality. The room was good and we appreciated having a full kitchen for the week. The pool was in poor shape and needed to be cleaned and filled. However, the location of the hotel was fantastic.",nan,nan,ta_s943

The rooms are comfortable and clean, the kitchen with its full-sized refrigerator made light meals and quick snacks easy, and the location one block off Michigan and across the street from Nordstrom was perfect for our purposes. The staff was professional, courteous and outdid themselves, even when 14 boxes of books arrived unexpectedly that immediately had to be shipped elsewhere. I especially appreciated Veronica at the front desk, Nawar at the bell desk and Amer who were always ready with a smile and a sincere wish to be helpful.

trip_advisor,"For a stateside hotel, especially one in an old building, it is comfortable and the rooms fairly modern. As is a common problem with lots of downtown hotels in the US however the rooms are quite dark and when you delve a little deeper and look around the room it doesnt maintain the initial level of ""gloss"" that it is trying to portray. For such a central location it is fairly quiet which is a big bonus. The location is excellent however, just by the main shopping street of Michigan Avenue, in a classy and safe neighbourhood. Pros: Location, fairly modern roomsCons: Beds/pillows not the best quality, gym is very shabby.",nan,nan,ta_s949

This hotel had great reviews, however I can't find much to say that is great.First night we are placed right outside of the elevator, a cramped room with a faulty fan and tv. Go to ask the front desk in the morning to switch rooms which they allowed but now have us in a room with stains on the carpet and again tv isn't working. Not sure if because it is the Final Four that they are blocking TBS.I won't be back.",nan,nan,ta_s950

In the end it is people who make the difference, and your Joshua is on the top of the list, in our opinion!Steve Albers",nan,nan,ta_s951
trip_advisor,"I can easily recommend this hotel to anyone who wants to stay in Chicago. Although it's a few blocks from the Loop and the CTA, a dozen bus routes pass nearby and it's ground zero for cabs, day or night. It's also ground zero for tourists, and if you're in town to do Magnificent Mile, deep dish pizza, etc, you could hardly do better than this place. They run excellent specials and you can get a room here at a deep discount on certain nights.The rooms are comparatively small, but why would you spend time in your room when there's so much to see and do outside?",nan,nan,ta_s952
trip_advisor,"Stayed at the Millenium for my bday weekend, was between here and the Drake. Should have stayed at the Drake. The Millenium was fine but with all the history I was hoping to feel like ""old chicago"" I guess the super small elevators and no room service is the only way you know you are in such a landmark.

trip_advisor,"Nothing terribly wrong here - good location, o.k. bar, hotel room was small but o.k., bathroom fine, clean and pretty quiet. My biggest issues were: 1) the maid service banged on the door between 7:45 and 8:30 each morning. What? This is too early. I was on jet lag the first morning and this was really bad not to get an extra 45 mins of sleep before I had to get up; and 2) slow slow service in the restaurant at breakfast - of 3 mornings, 2 took me over an hour to eat. The first morning, it took a half hour to get coffee and to order then another 20 mins for food. They said the kitchen was behind but it didn't look that way - it looked like only one waiter for the entire room. I wouldn't let these things keep you away - you can put the privacy note on door, and plan ahead re breakfast but the hotel should make adjustments.",nan,nan,ta_s954

Aside from that there are little tip offs: small elevators and hallways, doors look worn, etc. However, I was wildly impressed with how modern the rooms were. I stayed overnight for a work commitment and got a great nights sleep. I'd recommend the Knickerbocker to anyone interested in staying in the area.",nan,nan,ta_s957

We will DEFINITELY be coming back to the Knickerbocker.",nan,nan,ta_s958
trip_advisor,"Stayed for about four nights in August at the Millennium Knickerbocker in Chicago just off the Magnificent Mile. It's in a great location, walking distance to the shops on the mile and the lake in the other direction. Check in staff were delightful, really nice chap on the front desk. Room was nice, bed was big, decent tv and the bathroom modern and stylish with a waterfall shower. We even had a slither of a lake view through the window. Hotel has a real old school classy vibe which I liked, no pretensions of trying to be all modern and trendy, just a classy old school hotel that looks after its guests. The lobby is very grand and you might spend a lot of time there as the one drawback of the hotel is no wifi in the rooms, so you have to go down to the lobby if you don't want to pay. Overall, great place to stay, nice location, nice rooms, nice staff, the concierge even picked up my sunglasses and returned them for me when I left in them in the lobby.",nan,nan,ta_s959
trip_advisor,"We stayed a the knickerbocker hotel this past weekend and it was wonderful. We had a suite (which was unexpected) which was spacious and clean. The staff was friendly at check in and check out. The room was extremely quiet and, though we weren't, it seemed like we were the only ones on the floor. Our biggest complaint was the bath towels. For such a nice hotel, its like drying off with a loofah. The entrance to the hotel is beautiful, but the check in desk looks out of place. It could stand to be upgraded. I would recommend this hotel and would stay here again in the future!",nan,nan,ta_s960
trip_advisor,"We stayed for 2 nights to see the David Bowie exhibit at a nearby museum. The hotel staff was very courteous and went the extra mile to make sure our stay was a good one. We received an upgrade to a suite on a higher floor, which was very unexpected but definitely appreciated. The room was clean and quiet, of course since it was a suite- it was spacious. There was ample closet space and the bathroom was quite big, especially for a hotel. The only complaint we had was the mattress. It was soft, not what we are used to. Not sure if that was why we woke up several times during the night. All in all, it wasn't a major issue- more like a preference for a firmer mattress. The location is good for anyone who wants to be near Michigan Ave/Magnificent Mile.",nan,nan,ta_s961
trip_advisor,"You can't beat the Knickerbocker if you want a centrally located -- tucked away on a quiet street just off of Michigan Ave -- and comfortable, well appointed hotel in Chicago. Our room was spacious, very clean, and quiet. Comfy beds and good quality linen. The staff was friendly and helpful. Concierge Cheryl was especially helpful with great recommendations on what to see and do. On a busy Friday night, she got us into the popular Gino's East restaurant in about 10 minutes, while others waiting about an hour.",nan,nan,ta_s962
trip_advisor,"I booked this hotel online with a AAA room rating. I had some questions at various times which were answered promptly. I needed to add a night to my booking just prior to my stay & there was no problem at all. The hotel was clean. The room was quite large with a queen size bed but the view from my room was looking south into another building. I was on the 11th floor. The hotel is close to many attractions, bus service & rail service. Michigan Avenue is within walking distance. I was heading to a Ballgame at Wrigley Field & took the red line train straight to the park from Chicago/State, quite close as well.",nan,nan,ta_s963
trip_advisor,"First impression was how friendly and helpful all the staff were. At check-in, after looking to see what rooms were available, we were told ""Sorry, we don't have a room with a view. It just looks onto the street"". Feeling a little disappointed, we got to our room on the 3rd floor and ....... wow! This was the best room we had stayed in during our month long vacation. Sure, it looked out on East Walton Place but it was so quite. The room was BIG (at least by European standards). It was tastefully furnished, had a king (6' ft) bed with wonderful crisp sheets, an ample cupboard for hanging clothes with plenty of hangers, and a big bathroom with a walk-in shower. There were plenty of nice soft towels which got freshened up every day. Maid service was outstanding! We ate breakfast twice in 4 days - outstanding food & service. The staff at the cocktail bar, which we used every day!, were charming and knew how to make a great Margarita! Only complaint was there were 2 t/v's in the lounge constantly showing sport (well, baseball & American football if that's what you call sport!! I'm English and was brought up on Soccer, Rugby & Cricket - now, that's what I call sport!). Be careful of using the in-room monitor for internet access. If you do use it and you also use an i.pad/laptop as well, you might be charged twice the daily rate. We were, but queried the charge on checking out and the bill was reduced. We thought we had to use the in-room monitor to initially log on. The room was big enough for me to leave some of my clothes behind! Once back in the UK, I phoned the hotel and it was confirmed my belongings were in ""lost & found"". They were parceled up and sent to a friend in the Chicago area with no fuss and a minimal charge. I cannot rate this hotel highly enough - especially for the courteous service.",nan,nan,ta_s964
trip_advisor,"Stayed at the Knickerbocker from 15/09/14 for a week and had a great time. Hotel is in a perfect location just off the Magnificent Mile so it is a bit quieter. As soon as we arrived we met Charlie on the front door who helped us park y son's car for a great rate compared to the car park over the road. Had lots of chats with Charlie throughout the week and he told us all about the history of the hotel and the links with Al Capone which was fascinating. Charlie was great to talk to and just a shame that he wasn't working the day we checked out, hope he liked the card we left for him. The hotel lobby was nice with a comfortable bar area. When we checked in Simeon was very helpful and gave us a nice room on the 5th floor. The room was a good size, bed was huge and comfortable, TV was large and there was a useful information TV that helped us to pick out some good restaurants and attractions. The large rainhead shower was great and I had no problems with the water pressure unlike some reviews on here. We didn't have breakfast included in our rate so we did eat in the Nix restaurant on a few occasions and here we met another star in Andre who was so polite and helpful and always made us feel welcome. It was my wife's birthday while we were there and Andre gave her a free breakfast which was so generous. Again only regret was that on our last day Andre was working but again we hoped he liked the card we left for him. The hotel itself is in a great location with all the bars, shops and restaurants of Magnificent Mile on one side and close to the beach on the other side. This is an historic hotel that has been modernised but not too much and still retains an older charm. If you are looking for a modern/chic hotel then look elsewhere, but if you are looking for a grand old hotel which is comfortable and has brilliant staff then try the Knickerbocker. We'll be coming back to Chicago on a regular basis as our son has moved there so Charlie and Andre were coming to see you soon!",nan,nan,ta_s965
trip_advisor,"In town from East Coast for preplanning son's wedding events. Got a great rate by chance although this classic Chicago hotelwould be worth the standard rate if need be. Our room was a spacious, clean & very comfortable king standard, great jazz band in lobby most every evenings we were there, nice cocktail space overlooking lobby to enjoy featured martinis. Quick elevators. Will use it on a regular basis when visiting Chicago.",nan,nan,ta_s966
trip_advisor,"We have friends from Sao Paulo, S.Am. and when they came to visit, we reserved rooms at the Knickerbocker. Wonderful staff...very helpful. Our last evening there, the band (trio) in the bar in the lobby just happened to be playing Latin music. Loved it. Just felt like we were enclosed in a golden cocoon. Of course the drinks may have had something to do with that. Would go back again and again.",nan,nan,ta_s967
trip_advisor,We were in Chicago for 5 days slowly making our way across the country. We were greeted by such friendly staff. The girl from New Zealand at check in was helpful in providing a map and circling areas she though we she explore first. The man that was at the concierge desk at night (I forgot his name) was great at providing advice about restaurants etc. And Craig one of the doormen was hilarious. All the bellboys were quite friendly and always had something nice to say.Having stayed at several hotels during our vacation the knickerbocker was one of the few where we felt we could always ask someone for help or advice and we would receive it with enthusiasm. The location was great just minutes from the magnificent mile...very close to Ghirardelli (best desserts ever),nan,nan,ta_s968
trip_advisor,"This is a great hotel perfect for the shore,shops and sightseeingThe room was the best we had in travelling in the U.S. With the best most comfortable bed with excellent linen,the room had plenty of storage space and the shower room was spacious with quality fittings and towelsAgain we are surprised about comment about the Hotel being dated this a beautiful Hotel with classic style,do Americans appreciate heritage ? It's like saying Windsor Castle is old fashioned!! The lift is perfectly adequate and not particularly small,you should see some in Europe 2 people and a caseWe found the staff helpful and very pleasant and the bar staff mix a mean cocktail Breakfasts were delicious although we only had two out of 4 days as we did brunch in the Hancocks Tower and a light meal in the little Italian at the base of the Hancock which was really goodWe would certainly recommend the Knickerbocker for a lovely stay in Chicago We had a small problem with our bill over Wifi access don't use the in room device to log in as you get charged twice if you have an Ipad but it was easily sorted out it is quite expensive any way",nan,nan,ta_s969
trip_advisor,"I am a Chicago native and chose to stay at the Millennium Knickerbocker Hotel for my September wedding. Our room was booked 7 months in advance by calling the actual hotel, referencing our room block and receiving a coupe email confirmations. One day before we were supposed to check in (2 days before our wedding) the hotel sends an email to me that they are no longer able to accommodate our booking for a Presidential Suite. I politely asked why and agreed with the sales coordinator - Justin - we could go ahead and take two adjoining rooms since we needed the space for bridesmaids to get ready in. Upon arrival on Friday, we checked in, get to our room and do NOT have two adjoining suites. Long story short, we went back down to the front desk, complained as this is the second time they messed up our reservation and now only one day before our wedding and hours before guests were arriving and our rehearsal dinner. While the front desk gentleman was very polite and accommodating, the sales coordinator and supervisor were both quite rude and could really care less that they made numerous mistakes, though we several room blocks filled. We really received no sincere apology and the property itself is very dated (they argue historic) and not worth the price. Definitely do not recommend staying here, especially for a major event. Really terrible customer service.",nan,nan,ta_s970
trip_advisor,"Recently stayed three nights over the labor day weekend and booked the trip via expedia. Staff was very friendly. We arrived at 9 am Friday and when we asked if they would hold our bags until check in, they said they had a room available and waived the early check in fee. Which was appreciated. We had a king size supreme room which was clean. The bathroom only had a shower, which while very nice, had no place to put a foot up when you wanted to shave your legs. Its just one of those little things that only a woman would notice. I loved that they provided bathrobes. The location is great for walking and exploring the city. My only complaint was they did not provide free wi-fi, which I expect most hotels to provide. It seemed stingy to me for such a nice hotel to not provide that service to their guests. We did not eat at their restaurant or drink at the bar as there are too many other options within the city.I highly recommend the Belgian Bakery about a block and a half up Walton. They had the best baked goods in the city for a reasonable price and very high quality. I also recommend the Indian restaurant next to the bakery. They have a very good Indian buffet for a reasonable price.",nan,nan,ta_s971
trip_advisor,"This deal through Travelzoo was fantastic. The hotel was updated, clean, professional and welcoming. The hotel staff was accommodating and very helpful. We asked, and they recommended the easiest and least expensive way to get where we wanted to go, and hooray, it worked out wonderful. The breakfast was included and very good and great coffee! We had a whole group going to the Detroit Tiger game and we had a blast. The city is so clean and friendly, I love it.",nan,nan,ta_s972
trip_advisor,"The location: Excellent location as we were in town to explore. Right off of Mag Mile and a block from the John Hancock tower. Also, an amazing Belgian bakery just a block away. Super close to the water's edge as well!The staff: Just fine. Check-in and check-out was a breeze. The only small issue was when we wanted to leave our bags after we checked-out because we had some exploring to do before catching the train out of town. The woman at the front desk did not communicate very well as to who would be taking the bags. We waited a couple minutes off to the side (the lobby was very busy and people were checking in) and finally I approached the bellhop and he took care of us. Also, we had asked for additional towels and another robe at the reservation desk late one evening, they were brought to us promptly. The room: Carpet needs replacing. Bed was very comfortable and everything was clean. Loved the shower head. Seemed like the whole room could use some updating as the wallpaper was peeling a bit in the corners near the floor. The PC in our room was useless to us as we were definitely not paying to surf the web and the recommended restaurants and attractions was extremely limited (I'm assuming the only ones listed were those that chose to pay an advertisement fee). Also, wifi is free in the lobby however, $11 in the room- seems a bit steep as many hotels today offer free wifi. Overall: Felt like I was paying for the name on the building and not the actual experience. We did not have a chance to explore the restaurant and bar on site as our time was limited. Will most likely try out another hotel in the same area next time in the city.",nan,nan,ta_s974
trip_advisor,"My family and I went and stayed at the knickerbocker on a Travelzoo package, so i was a bit concerned we would be treated ""differently"" than their regular guest, this was not the case at all! As a matter if fact we could not have been treated better! Everyone and I mean everyone was simply amazing, the friendliest staff i have ever encountered. The rooms were beautiful and upscale the food was excellent. Close to so many of Chicago's attractions, i give this hotel 5 plus stars!! now I have to give some extra credit for 3 exceptional members of the staff! Charlie The Door Man (I wish I knew his last name) made our stay truly exceptional he went out of his was every time we saw him, he took us on a personal tour of the grand ballroom and told us for the rich history the hotel has we never would had that opportunity had it not been for Charlie! Thank You Charlie for the great service you really love your job and it shows! then our waiter Andre again someone who loves his job, you made our breakfast an experience not just eating! and then Simon when we had a minor concern with our bill you graciously helped me and rectified it quickly and happily thank you all for a awesome experience we will be back!!!

trip_advisor,"This was my first visit to Chicago , not so my partner who had been before on business and had stayed at the Knickerbocker on one of these occasions and been impressed. It was my big birthday trip and was therefore hoping to be wowed myself. I was not disappointed.Our room was,well appointed, spacious and clean as was the shower room. The lobby/ bar area is pleasant and welcoming, be careful if the cocktails served as they are much stronger than you would get in an English barThe only thing to let this hotel down was that the restaurant was not open in the evening in the earlier part of the week and as we had planned to dine in on our first night - my birthday- it was a disappointment. perhaps we should have checked ahead but you do expect a city hotel of this size to have full dining service,we could have eaten at the bar but not the special treat we where looking for. Conveniently situated for both the lakeside and shopping centres.Breakfast was a bit expensive but the food was good there is the option of buffet or full service menu.",nan,nan,ta_s976
trip_advisor,This hotel deserves the highest praise it's staff are first class the room is lovely and the location 2 blocks from Macy's could not be bettered. The hotel is minutes from the lakeside promenade and is centrally located for both the Navy pier and Lincoln park Zoo. Have thoroughly enjoyed Chicago and recommend this hotel every time.,nan,nan,ta_s977
trip_advisor,"Got a 2-day special through Groupon for Knickerbocker and we LOVED the hotel!! So close to great shopping on Michigan Ave. It was beautifully decorated and maintained. Our room was a knock out with soft bed, linens and pillows. The bathroom was modern and elegant. Staff was always smiling and helpful. We ate breakfast for the 2 mornings in the Nix restaurant and it was delicous. Our waiter Alex was extremely friendly and attentive. We are coming back to Chicago in December and will plan to stay again at the Knickerbocker",nan,nan,ta_s978
trip_advisor,"This summer my hubby and I went on our honeymoon. He had never been to Chi town so that's where we went. I am forever grateful that I chose this hotel. The staff really goes over and beyond the call of duty to make guests comfortable and happy. When we first arrived the guy at the desk, Simeon, and I were talking and I mentioned that it was our honeymoon. The next thing I know there was a knock on my door and we were greeted with chocolate strawberries and champaign! What a special treat! Our personal bellman Craig was very helpful. Andre and Minerva who served us in the restaurant were also very professional and personable. The beauty of the hotel provides a very nostalgic and refreshing experience. The food was superb! I highly recommend this hotel.",nan,nan,ta_s979
trip_advisor,"This is a lovely hotel, don't get me wrong. Full of character, nice staff, comfy king size bed. I'm giving it just 3 points because a hotel without room service is a huge issue for me. I really cannot understand the reason why they dint have room service. I know we have plenty of options just a few minutes away, I know we can order food from the bar and take it upstairs, I know we can order food from outside but guess what, after a long flight I just want to stay in my room, have some food and sleep. And I don't know why, but the air con in my room was programmed for 16C , so my room was freezing cold. But apart from that, lovely hotel.",nan,nan,ta_s980
trip_advisor,Stayed at the hotel for a birthday celebration and girls night out weekend! The hotel itself is beautiful and is in a good location. That is the good stuff. The bad there is NO parking garage or street parking for patrons of the hotel. So you have to pay between $42 and 80$ to park your car overnight. The hotel staff was just ok. They screwed up the reservation even after a call was made prior to us checking in to verify that 2 rooms with 2 queen beds were reserved. when we arrived the guy says there are no more queen beds and because the reservation was made through hotwire it couldn't be guaranteed. We ended up sharing a 1 bed king suite and a 1 bed king regular room among 7 women. the suite did have a pull out sofa bed but to me the check in staff was unapologetic and really didn't try to accommodate everyone. the cleaning staff was good but were rude. The staff working outside and the concierge were very friendly and made the hotel stay worth staying. The room itself was ok. the carpet was worn and they should replace it. The bathroom was really nice and the suite had an excellent jet Jacuzzi. The overhead shower and hand-held nozzle was very nice as well .The Wi-Fi was not free....in fact they charged for all extra amenities. For a luxury hotel you really only pay for the name and location but everything else they charge you for. The bed was comfortable but the decorative runner across the bed had stains on it. The bar area was nice and they made good drinks. The bar staff was very nice. Overall the hotel stay was just ok. I would not have chosen this hotel because I prefer to have a more modern look and feel and this is a historic feel hotel but I was with a group and the majority won!,nan,nan,ta_s981
trip_advisor,"Pluses are many. Lovely hotel right in the centre of shops and restaurants, near to Hancock tower. Very helpful staff especially the concierge and bus boys out the front who recommended a number of local breakfast places. Two minutes away from a beach!!!! What a fantastic place to walk cycle or jog with incredible views alongside Lake Michigan Lots to see and do. Only downside is the lack of local subway station so everything is walking taxis or buses. Aircon is a bit loud at times but not a real problem. Local restaurants are many but very busy. Eg Cheesecake Factory under Hancock tower",nan,nan,ta_s982
trip_advisor,"This hotel was perfect for a city trip to Chicago. It is located in the upscale Gold Coast neighbourhood which is walkable and safe. The hotel is nice, with a beautifully decorated lobby and nice martini bar. The staff were helpful, Paul gave us lots of great advice on transit and sightseeing. The rooms are clean and comfortable and the rain showers were a nice feature. Breakfast is available, but you can find better value at nearby coffee shops if you are happy with a quick bite. There is a limited selection of restaurants around the hotel, I would recommend planning ahead for dinner so you don't waste time wandering the neighbouring streets looking for a place to eat. As you walk towards the Loop, you will find more dining options.",nan,nan,ta_s983
trip_advisor,"We stayed during a girls getaway had a double room on the third floor. The room smelled very strange when we first arrived but the second day after they cleaned it, it was a little better. We never ate breakfast or lunch it was very pricey but nice that they offer those things. The location really was the selling point for us right next to the magnificent mile and a short distance to the beach.",nan,nan,ta_s984
trip_advisor,"We stayed 5 nights in The Knickerbocker Hotel on Walton in Chicago. The location is 3 minutes from Oak Street Beach and 5 minutes from the junction of N State & N Rush where visitors will find a little hidden treasure of bars, restaurants and fantastic nightlife as well as great shops. The hotel is old and with plenty of character and the rooms modern and well apportioned, one little downside is having to pay for WiFi in the rooms. It's free in the Lobby, I would also like to mention the Staff really helpful and friendly. If you get a chance to stay here I would recommend you take it.",nan,nan,ta_s985
trip_advisor,Just got back from 3 day stay here. Lobby of hotel is very ornate and beautiful. Small restaurant to the left and a nice size bar area to the right. Check in was flawless and front desk staff were very friendly. Sixth floor room with king bed. Room was a little crammed with this bed. Dressers and end tables were old and worn. Swivel chair at desk was from the eighties and falling apart. Bathroom was very modern with updated fixtures and and huge walk in shower with rain shower head. The bed was very comfy but the pillows were very soft. The room was very clean and neat. Hotel is at north end of Magnificent Mile and 1 block east of Michigan ave. It is about 12 blocks north of the Chicago river so it is not exactly centrally located. We had very good weather for the first two days so we did not mind walking everywhere we wanted to go. 5 stars for the service here but 3 stars for the room. Got a deal on Hotwire but do not thnk I would pay full price to stay here.,nan,nan,ta_s987
trip_advisor,"As a partner in the restaurant industry, I wanted to take a minute to recognize and thank the Knickerbocker for a great stay... But, that's not the purpose of this review / write up. In my haste to jump in a cab, with a phone attached to my ear, I left behind my bag. I immediately contacted the hotel and Simeon located it quickly and I said I would turn around and return. If Chicago traffic wasn't bad enough, battling it once, now I get to enjoy it three times... Oh well, my fault, right? Seconds later Simeon calls me back and says, Mr. Kendall, no need to return, I will put your bag in a car and have it sent to you at the airport.That's service! Not to mention a HUGE time saver. Simeon, I thank you very much and please, never stop that level of care, concern and hospitality.CheersBrian Kendall",nan,nan,ta_s988
trip_advisor,"People say that visiting Chicago in July is a toss-up. It could be hot and humid, is was not. It could be raining and thunderstorms, it wasn't. We were met by mid 70's and 57% (which is low for Chicago) and everyday was a true adventure. Our hotel is an art-deco style building in the heart Chicago, built in mid 1920's with NIX a breakfast and lunch bright, colorful eatery with some great music provided by our knowledgeable waiter Andre. Some people might say it is a bit pricey, but your in a 5 star hotel in Chicago. Front desk staff was pleasant and quick to assist you. People also have said that the WiFi in rooms should be free, but again if your on vacation why do you need WiFi. The rooms have not been changed from when they were new so they seem small to some guests. The elevators are original size too also a bit small but OK. If you need assistance from concierge both Cheryl and her counterpart really know their stuff. Stop by most anytime to find out about eateries, museums, boat tours, etc. The deco style bar in lobby area had a special 'Tapas and Flamenco evening with great ""small dishes"" like fajitas chicken egg rolls-yummy, huge green-lipped mussels from New Zealand-largest we have ever seen and delicious, and more. We could not ask for better with fabulous guitarists and beautiful Spanish dancer.Those were the best comments. The worst are that hotel charges $65 a day to park a car (outrageous) The new computers in rooms need correcting they go on at 8 a.m. and if you pull the plug-it will disconnect your telephone. All in all the Millennium Knickerbocker Hotel Chicago was great!",nan,nan,ta_s989
trip_advisor,"I highly recommend this hotel. All of the hotel personnel that I interacted with were so professional and helpful- from the concierges at the front desk to the staff at the check in desk. For example, I arrived much earlier than expected and thought I would check my bags until a room was available. But as soon as I arrived, the staff at the greet desk suggested I go to the check in desk. At the check in desk, the staff immediately looked to see if a room was available and it was. She didn't have to do this and it was a busy time in the lobby. Also later I had to ask for directions from another staff person at the greet desk and he also was very helpful and knowledgeable. Even the maids were polite, smiling and helpful.The room itself was really great. Quiet. Well designed. I even had a bit of a view of the Lake! It is a fantastic location. Quiet. So close to the beaches. I went for a wonderful walk in the morning on the lakeshore. At checkout the person who helped me also was very friendly and polite. This is a very carefully and well managed hotel. All of the aspects of my experience did not happen by accident. I was very impressed by the quality in all aspects.",nan,nan,ta_s990
trip_advisor,"You could not book a hotel in a better location. At the corner of Michigan Ave for shopping, State Ave for nightlife and great restaurants, and 5 mins away from the beach.

The staff is friendly and the place was spotless. But again... location location location!",nan,nan,ta_s991
trip_advisor,"This hotel was brilliant, central location in Chicago, easy to walk to many restaurants and bars. The staff were very helpful and friendly. We were there during the World Cup and the bar had themed specials on for food and alcohol for each game which was fun.The restaurant is only open for breakfast and there is no room service however the bar has a small bar bites menu running. Not really an issue considering how many wonderful restaurants are close.Room was lovely and clean, free wifi in lobby and bar area.",nan,nan,ta_s992
trip_advisor,"This place is excellent and I would recommend to anyone. The restaurant, bar, lobby and rooms were all clean and well maintained. The staff were all very friendly and courteous. The location is fantastic.Instead of paying $65/night to park our car w/a valet at the hotel, we parked in a public garage at Orleans & Hubbard and paid $28/night. We didn't mind and for a difference of almost $40/night, we didn't mind the extra walk as we walked all around during our stay.",nan,nan,ta_s993
trip_advisor,"The hotel is in a great location and the room is modernized style and clean. The only issue is some staff may not be very helpful with their duty which includes concierge who does not have answers on several tourist questions, bell man who does not open the door but standing next to the door that you need to be careful while pushing open it. We got a promotion deal which we are not expect high quality service. But to the people who pay regular price, you may want to be prepared that the hotel service may short of your money.",nan,nan,ta_s994
trip_advisor,"You really cannot go wrong staying here. It's a small, stylish historic hotel with an intimate boutique atmosphere to it. It has the air of a place that people ""in the know"" would stay at. You're going to feel a bit special - and smart - for picking it. For the price, location, and comfort, it's perfect.I was initially a bit worried about being so close to the bustle of Michigan Ave, but the location of the hotel is one of its best features. It's about a block north of where the real touristy, shopping portions end, so it's quiet and tucked away from the chaos while simultaneously very close to high-end shopping and sights. You're near to the Red Line on Chicago Ave., and you're also right at the intersection of quite a few bus routes (If you're feeling adventurous, that is. Just ask the concierge for some tips; it's honestly one of the easiest ways to move about the city). You are not going to have difficulty getting where you need to go.Staff was exceptionally kind, quick, and friendly. Room was clean. The king-sized bed was plush and restful, and the pillows are super soft, which is a must for me. Bathrooms are clean, chic, and modern; I always looked forward to showering. Everything was cozy, comfortable, and well designed. And make sure to stop by the bar downstairs. They have a couple cocktails that will really hit the spot after a day around town.Just stop looking around for a place to pick for your stay in Chicago. You've found it. This is it.",nan,nan,ta_s995
trip_advisor,"My stay at this hotel was ideal. The location is perfect; near to the beach, Navy Pier, shopping, and dining. The hotel staff were exceptional with just the right touch of hospitality. The man who prepared my drink at the Martini Bar was very helpful to me, a novice when it comes to Martinis. The waiter in the restaurant was pleasant as he served my early morning breakfast of delicious salmon and eggs with Hollandaise. The front desk staff were helpful and cordial as were the concierge staff. My room was clean, the bed oh so comfy and clean. Believe me, I checked it right down to the mattress. As a woman traveling alone, I felt safe because they knew I was there. My name was on the welcome screen in my room. I even got a phone call seconds after I submitted my review of my stay. The staff were accommodating and professional. It felt comfortable and homey in the midst of Chicago.",nan,nan,ta_s996
trip_advisor,"This is not a top of the line, 5 star hotel. However, it has everything a trip advisor fan looking for an excellent bargain wants: location, updated and well appointed rooms, very helpful and considerate staff, and service and amenities that far exceed the price. We even managed to find a discount coupon that included an upgraded room, free breakfast, and $25 credit for the bar. Without question, I will stay here again. We had excellent accomadations and saved a lot of money by using internet discount coupons for the hotel and parking. A great vacation.",nan,nan,ta_s997
trip_advisor,"This hotel is in a good location - the North end of the Magnificent Mile. Close to Navy Pier, Millennium Park, the red line of the CTA, shopping and restaurants. It's an old hotel but the rooms have been renovated. I really liked the lobby bar and the general historic feel of the common areas. The room was spacious (there was 3 of us) and the bathroom had both a jacuzzi tub and a shower. My only complaints about the hotel is the maid service was very poor. She really just made our beds. She didn't restock our glasses or leave extra toilet paper or put the ironing board away. She left behind a dirty dusting rag. Our mini bar fridge didn't work so we couldn't put food in it and not that I generally drink things from the bar but I certainly wouldn't if the beverages were warm ie beer. None of these things, however, are deal breakers and I would totally recommend this hotel.",nan,nan,ta_s998

We were there for three days and three nights, and there is a European essence and timelessness to this hotel that is very warm and inviting. My room was nicely appointed and found it to be quite comfortable. It had elegant touches throughout and the service was excellent. We also ate in the bar area two nights and once for lunch. It is a relatively simple menu, and I can highly recommend the tomato soup, club sandwich, burger and all of the appetizers. It was a relaxing environment with an old world sophistication that we really liked. The service and people working at the hotel were warm with engaging personalities, and this was one of the points of difference that we noticed throughout. It felt very well managed overall. The Millennium is extremely well located, right across from the Drake, and whether it is shopping, or in our case a Trade Show, we found it to be super-convenient. I highly recommend the Millennium Knickerbocker if you are looking for a great hotel with timeless charm and hospitality.",nan,nan,ta_s999
trip_advisor,"This is a historic hotel which has recently been renovated. The room was attractive, quiet and clean. The bed was comfortable. On the first floor, the restaurant and bar are good for people watching. The location is just steps from Michigan Avenue, with its shopping, restaurants and entertainment. It is also very close to the beach on Lake Michigan. I stayed for one night and was very pleased.",nan,nan,ta_s1000
trip_advisor,"Had a great overnight stay here through a Travelzoo deal that included the Executive Room for one night, a lounge credit of $25.00, and two breakfasts for $99.00. The location was perfect..one half block east of N Michigan Avenue just north of the John Hancock building. The beds were comfy, and all needs were met during our stay. The morning's hotel bill, however, that was slid under the door, reflected additional charges of $77.00 (?), an additional $10.00 for an upgrade, and additional tax charges, which totaled nearly $100.00. A quick visit to the main desk downstairs resulted in the hotel correcting errors that they stated they had made due to coding of the stay having been improperly entered at time of reservation. They removed all additional charges except for the $7.00 in room taxes which I expected to pay. I didn't need the distress, but was happy they corrected it as I have two more evenings this summer with this same deal which is excellent!",nan,nan,ta_s1002
trip_advisor,"Pros - (1) great location on East Walton across from The Drake Hotel, 2 short blocks from Water Tower Place, surrounded by Magnificent Mile shopping and restaurants; (2) rooms are clean and tastefully designed, quiet, with comfortable beds; (3) got a good price with a special offer on the website ($100-125 per room); (4) friendly helpful staffCons - (1) $65 per day valet parking (public parking around the block is $32 per day but no in and out privileges); (2) bathrooms small with sliding door that is not that private and overhead shower that is not easy to adjust; (3) breakfast service was slow; buffet is quick, of course, but lacking some standards (such as oatmeal, bagels, granola, bananas); (4) outdated computers in business office slow and prone to crash, even just printing boarding passes; (5) small exercise room had 6 treadmill/elliptical machines, small free weight area with one bench and a limited machine. .",nan,nan,ta_s1003
trip_advisor,Spent two days in Chicago at one of the BEST hotels I have stayed in. This hotel was in a perfect location and had some of the nicest staff. Easy walking distance to the beach and to one of the largest shopping areas around. Parking was a little high but you are in Chicago! Breakfast was very good and awesome window seating. Thanks for an awesome trip!,nan,nan,ta_s1004
trip_advisor,"I brought my sister to Chicago for a girls weekend and we stayed at the Millennium near the Hancock Building. Great location with easy walking access to Michigan Ave as well as Lake Shore Blvd. The hotel is older but doesn't feel out of date. Room was small but nicely decorated. Beds were super comfortable and the rain shower head made the bathroom amazing. Pricy, but it was worth it. Would recommend using Priceline or Hotwire to get a better deal.",nan,nan,ta_s1005
trip_advisor,"This was my first trip to Chicago and one of my travelling companions had so enjoyed her stay at Millenium Knickerbocker Hotel last year that we all decided to stay here this time. The hotel is well situated near the lakefront and CBD so venturing out was easy. The rooms are well appointed with very comfy beds and bathrooms. The staff made us feel welcome and assisted us very ably to find tour information, taxis etc. The lobby bar was well-stocked and we were able to wind down after our busy days with a delicious cocktail. In all the Millenium Knickerbocker gave a great introduction to Chicago - there were only a couple of points that disappointed. Firstly, there was no free wi-fi which was a bit of a nuisance and seems a bit behind the times. Also, the rooms were equipped with a touch-screen PC which was meant to provide information about nearby attractions. I found this a bit bewildering to use and rather limited in scope, but I imagine this is a work in progress. I wouldn't hesitate to stay here again.",nan,nan,ta_s1006
trip_advisor,"Hotel has a wonderful location, as its very-very close to Magnificent Mile which is famous for shopping and dining. We had dinners at Michael Jordan's Steakhouse and next evening at Weber's Grill and both restaurants were within an easy walking distance.Breakfast quaility in the Hotel is not an award winning level, but its not bad. Just average.Rooms is spacious and quiet.Checkout was really slow as there were only 2 staff there.",nan,nan,ta_s1007
trip_advisor,"I arrived at the hotel the night before my daughter was graduating from medical school. A big event in our family. When we checked into the hotel, they had said that Expedia had cancelled our reservation and they were totally booked. That was strange since we booked and paid for our hotel room two months prior on Hotels.com ($99 rate). Hotels.com had just sent us a reminder about our upcoming reservation just days prior. We got the manager involved and they somehow found a room for us. The hotel was good (if a nice view isn't important), but that experience did not sit well with us. Especially after we saw several instances of this happening with other people in the hotel reviews. Word of caution, if you book this hotel at a super low rate, call to confirm your reservation before you arrive.",nan,nan,ta_s1008
trip_advisor,"One night stay here when I was visiting downtown prior to a wedding outside of Chicago. As others have said, the location is excellent. Very convenient for shopping on and around Michigan Ave. The hotel itself is great. The doormen and concierge were very helpful with bags and dining recommendations. We were allowed to check in at 11, even though formal check-in isn't until 3PM. Stayed in a King room. It was clean and well-amenitized. Room was updated, bed was comfortable. I will admit however that the King rooms are not very spacious. With all the furniture there's not much floor room to put your stuff. Only real complaint I had about the room was that there isn't a fan in the bathroom. This can be a problem for obvious reasons, exaggerated by the fact that the bathroom door is not a normal door, but a pocket-sliding door. By no means a deal-breaker. Overall very pleased with this stay. Will definitely look here first for my next trip to Chicago.",nan,nan,ta_s1009
trip_advisor,"What a horrible experience. I cannot recommend this hotel to anyone who values knowing their reservation is secure. My reservation was made through Expedia months earlier. I showed up - with my confirmation number - and they tried to tell me that Expedia had moved me! Yet Expedia still showed me at the Millennium. Why would Expedia move me and still charge me the Millennium rate? Here's what I believe happened. With multiple conferences in Chicago, they were booked. Others told me some rooms in town were going for twice what I paid through Expedia because they tried to book so late. I believe the Millennium took my reservation then realized later they could get more for the room. So they canceled me. They set me up in a cheaper hotel and pocketed the difference. To say the least, they are not customer friendly.",nan,nan,ta_s1010
trip_advisor,"I stayed at the Millennium Knickerbocker this week on a business trip for just one night. The hotel is a nice manageable size. Check-in is a little challenging to notice initially as it it to the rear of the lobby. The rooms are tastefully done in a soothing contemporary style. Beds are comfortable. Though I didn't use lobby bar, it's attractive and open. The hotel restaurant food was above average. No newstand/guest shop in the hotel. It does have a fitness center, which I didn't use. Throughout my stay, I found the staff friendly and helpful. Location is just off Michigan Avenue so it's a good location for shopping. I've stayed in much more luxurious hotels but I would definitely stay here again. It's good value for the money.",nan,nan,ta_s1011
trip_advisor,"I purchased a voucher on TravelZoo for a 2 night stay at the Knick. I hadn't stayed there in probably 17 years but remembered that it was a fabulous location. My friend and I were able to check in early and catch a cab to the White Sox/Indians game with time to spare. Over the course of the next two days, we shopped and ate and shopped and ate and made multiple trips back to our rooms with our goodies. Each and every time, the doormen were friendly and courteous and we were greeted by staff inside the hotel as well. There was never a wait for a cab when needed, housekeeping was friendly and thorough and the food at the Nix was fresh and delicious. My only regret is that I didn't purchase a second voucher but I would willingly stay at the Knick again with or without one! Kudos to you!",nan,nan,ta_s1012
trip_advisor,I've stayed at the Millennium Knickerbocker for four years in a row while attending a trade show. Rooms are small but luxurious. Wonderful staff. Perfect boutique hotel atmosphere. Great lobby bar and the restaurant serves a wonderful breakfast. They've upgraded me for no reason a number of times simply as a nice gesture. Location is a block off the Magnificent Mile so it doesn't get any better. Would highly recommend.,nan,nan,ta_s1013
trip_advisor,"No bath tub, no room service at all (!), and extremely few TV channels. It's just an okay hotel and not what one would expect for a 4-star hotel -- would never stay there again. I'd give it 2 stars. Oh, and you'll just want to wash your hands when you touch the long ""decorative"" velvet pillow to get it off the bed. Really, just avoid this hotel. Even with help from nice manager Sam, and from Edward, this was not a good experience.",nan,nan,ta_s1014
trip_advisor,"I was not happy with this hotel at first because when we went to check in they said they had overbooked & needed to send us to another hotel about 8 miles from them. I really wanted to get to explore Chicago that night but instead had to settle on Skokie, IL. They paid for our cab fare to the other hotel & then back to them the next day. The hotel was nice. Bigger room than I thought it would be. Bar was okay. Breakfast was good but pricey. Tiny refrigerator that was a mini bar & there wasn't any room to store stuff. Only 2 small nightstand drawers for clothing storage & we were staying 5 nights. Didn't like the rainshower head in the shower. Luckily there was also a hand held wand so I could rinse off. We needed to stay an extra night because my husband was sick & they accommodated us because of the mixup the first night. They gave us the same rate we paid initially which was low. We walked everywhere and the location was good. Don't know if I would stay there again because of the overbooking fiasco. Never had that happen to me before.",nan,nan,ta_s1015
trip_advisor,I am NOT Happy with the Millennium Knickerbocker Hotel at the moment. Myself and two other couples reserved rooms months ago. We received confirmations from Expedia and Hotmail yesterday confirming our reservations. My husband called yesterday to see if we could extend our stay by one night only to find out that our reservations had been cancelled by the hotel. Apparently someone forgot to block off rooms for a large group and they continued booking rooms. SHAME ON YOU - MILLENNIUM KNICKERBOCKER!! So far we do not have confirmed rooms downtown Chicago.,nan,nan,ta_s1016
trip_advisor,"Had the most enjoyable hotel stay at the Millennium Knickerbocker Hotel Chicago from June 3-5, 2014. This hotel lived up to its hype of being a 4 star hotel with class. Everyone was friendly and Kasey checked us into a corner room. We had a bit of a view but the room with king bed was comfortable and well decorated. We received a free refrigerator and as a part of our ""deal"" with TravelZoo we received not only an inexpensive rate, but free breakfasts (both days) and $25 at the Martini Bar. My husband and I worked out both days we were there and enjoyed the fitness options. The Nix Restaurant served amazing breakfasts from a menu and the wait staff was friendly and attentive. The Martini Bar served excellent martinis; the bartender was friendly, helpful and provided a carafe of munchies to go with our drinks. The Knickerbocker is old school charm and class and very quiet for being located right off of Michigan Ave. I would recommend this hotel to anyone. We will stay here again!",nan,nan,ta_s1017
trip_advisor,"I stayed at the Knickerbocker in mid-May for a conference; the location was fantastic, right off of the Magnificent Mile and close to all the shopping, nightlife and activities that Chicago offers. The hotel has an old world charm with a classic decor. I would consider upgrading to a larger room, as my standard king was quite small (it was fine this time as I alone, but if my wife was with me I think it would have been a bit cramped). I encountered no issues during my four night stay, and would stay here again.",nan,nan,ta_s1018
trip_advisor,"I am here to attend an annual oncology conference. The drive from O'Hare international airport is looong. The hotel is a quaint little place located just off North Michigan avenue. Convenient to reach all important areas in the city.The staff are courteous and helpful. The breakfast is just adequate - we are pampered by our luxury Indian hotels and their variety!The rooms are small,so is the bath but bed is comfortable.The lobby has a good bar and is a nice place to while your time away.",nan,nan,ta_s1019
trip_advisor,"I stayed here for one night. taking advantage of an Amex promotion. I was not disappointed, the beds were large and comfy, room spacious, and heating worked perfectly (we arrived during a snowstorm just after the Polar Vortex!). The bathroom's sliding door was a bit inconvenient, because it had large gaps so you can see whoever is inside (I keep seeing this in many public toilets in the US, what's up with that???). I really like the location, within walking distance to my favorite leathergoods store Frye, and the MagMile shopping street. The building is also beautiful, probably a restored old building. The staff was especially nice and cheerful, we felt very well taken care of. The guy who helped us with our bags was especially friendly.Parking was really expensive, almost as much as the cost of the room.",nan,nan,ta_s1020
trip_advisor,"We stayed here in July last year. We had actually booked another hotel in Chicago that we didn't realize was so far out of the city. So we booked this one very last minute and we were so glad we did. The staff were amazing, they would remember our names and our drink orders when we would have a couple of wines down at the bar before dinner. The room was good and everything was very clean. We loved it",nan,nan,ta_s1021
trip_advisor,"Ever since we stayed here, I have been dying to write about how exceptional this hotel is and I wanted to have the perfect wording, but I don't think there are enough words in the dictionary to showcase how lovely the Knickerbocker is.Every Valentines Day weekend my husband and I follow a tradition... it was our first date 7 years ago on vday and we utterly love this weekend. It is a little getaway for us and lets not forget eating some great Chicago food. Dinner is always at Tavern on Rush (LOVE IT), drinks at whatever bar we like, breakfast at The Original Pancake House (yum) and the Chicago Auto Show. We never stay at the same hotel cause we like to stay all over... however, I think we have found one amazing little gem.We picked the Knickerbocker for two main reasons, price and location. For $100 a night in the city, its a steal. Then, it is within a short walking distance to Tavern. Once we enter the building, we can tell that a wedding is going on and everybody is pre-drinking in the lobby/martini bar. I am instantly jealous, cause not only do I LOVE weddings, but this seems like an amazing hotel to have your wedding at. We check in and the front desk clerk has to be the nicest guy. He asks us if we are celebrating anything, how are commute from the Burg was, if we need a taxi to dinner, etc. Also informs us that the lobby area will clear out in about 30 mins for the wedding.Elevator is small, but its an older hotel, and its not slow, so I'd rather it be small than opposed to slow. On our floor people are pre-drinking in the huge common area for the wedding (once again, jealousy enters my brain). Our room is just perfect and the shower was my favorite part. Pretty big for a hotel shower, rainfall shower head and an additional wand. We get dressed for our night out and visit the Martini bar. The bill is quite high, $30 for two drinks, but this is the city AND there was no skimping on the alcohol. I mean we both walked out feeling a little fuzzy and hungry for dinner.We just loved everything about it... All of the upgrades in the room were great, loved that it was a boutique hotel, the location, the staff, etc.I am sure we will be back next year :)",nan,nan,ta_s1022
trip_advisor,"The Knickerbocker hotel was the first 5 star hotel i stayed at by my self, and like Tony the Tiger says it was (Greaaat). I was surprised when i opened a drawer under the tv and saw every condiment u could imagine even a tooth brush. I opened the refrig, and saw those little bottles of licqure, I didn't open them because i don't drink alcohol. I did open some candy which cost $7. Every one says the halls are noisy, not so on the 6th floor, maybe because i was there the 3rd week of February (off season). I needed a comb so the door person told me to go a block away to a 24hr mart, i couldn't find it, so he walked me to it. The shower in the bathroom was a rain forest shower head and a shower wand with 25 water jets both of them u cant change settings, everyone is right, there is a big gap on bottom of door to hallway, lots of light comes in GO BIG KNICKERBOCKER!!!! Thanks from Mitchell Samuels ps. I will b back",nan,nan,ta_s1023
trip_advisor,"I had an excellent 5 night stay at The Millennium Knickerbocker. The staff was very professional and friendly, always helpful. One of the outstanding doormen gave us a great tip about taking the train into the airport which saved us about $50. The front desk clerk held our luggage until it was time for check-in so we could wander for a while. The staff here is the example of how hospitality should be. Overall I was very pleased with all aspects of the hotel and it was in walking distance to most places we wanted to visit! We shopped, ate, went sightseeing without having to get a taxi.It also gets my vote for most comfortable beds ever! I seriously have never slept this well on vacation. It was like sleeping on a cloud, I really hated to leave it behind. We now have friends in Chicago that we could stay with but I would not miss the chance to sleep in one of those bed again!",nan,nan,ta_s1024
trip_advisor,"Enjoyed my stay here. Though a historic hotel, I found it to be quiet, clean (excellent maid service) and a great value. Elevators worked well which is not always the case at historic hotels. Basic bar, lobby, gym, restaurant (not open for dinner so you will need to venture out but there are numerous options close by on foot). Biggest negative is parking for your vehicle as there is no self park options offered by the hotel. Valet is quite steep at $65 a night, but you do get in/out privileges. If you are looking for upscale amenities, look elsewhere, but if you are looking a good place to relax with easy access to Michigan Ave shopping at an exceptional value this is it!",nan,nan,ta_s1025
trip_advisor,"I debated between a 4 and 5 rating. It wasn't quite perfect but it was very good.The service is exceptional. Everyone on the staff was friendly and helpful. I'd like to give an extra mention to Charlie, the doorman, who not only helped us when we needed it, but made us feel extra special.We also took the historical tour of the hotel with Paul which was informative and a pleasure.The hotel is in an excellent location on the north end of the Gold Coast. Plenty of great shopping, dining and site seeing within walking distance, even in the winter.Our room was small but it had recently been renovated and was nice. They have a nice lobby / lounge area which is a great place for a casual drink.Parking is a bit of an issue. The hotel parking is rather expensive. There are other lots nearby where you can even reserve parking. That's expensive too but not quite as bad. Just the price you pay in the big city.Checkout is rather punctual at noon but we stored our bags until 5pm without an issue.This is a great place to go and we look forward to a return trip.",nan,nan,ta_s1026
trip_advisor,"Man what a place!Here is the breakdown. Service:Awesome, I needed Justin Timberlake tickets printed and didn't have access to a printer. The front desk man (Sam) was great! He told me to send him the tickets in email and printed them. Didn't have to wait. On top of that he was ready to answer questions and even got us a cab when we needed one. If you are the GM of this hotel, Sam should get a raise. We didn't deal with other staff so can't really comment on them. Value:Got a deal on Hotwire and paid like nothing. Great deal. Sleep Quality:Had a huge bed with a comfortable mattress, slept great (even after a few drinks). Cleanliness:This hotel is so clean that a soap bar gets jealous. Location: Well if being a block away from the Hancock Tower and beach isn't for you, I don't know what is. Perfect location!!Rooms:Perfect size, clean, gorgeous bathroom. We had a desk and they even had a computer in our room! Oh not to forget the bar fridge with everything in it. Overall:You will get royal treatment for the price of nothing by staying here. The hotel is older but definitely worth it. I can't wait to comeback in August with my kids :).",nan,nan,ta_s1027
trip_advisor,We booked this with Hotwire ...it was clean...staff was helpful and friendly. We wanted a place to relax and enjoy the city...the price was right as were the accommodations.

This is a charming and lovely hotel The front desk staff was very nice and actually every employee that we came across was quite friendly and accommodating. The room itself was nice, the computer on the desk to look at local jaunts was a great idea and helpful. The room was clean and the bed very comfortable. The bathroom and shower were also very nice. We sat for a bit in the martini bar and enjoyed the bartender Floyd. He is a funny man who kept us laughing. All in all, we got such a great price on Priceline for this hotel, it seemed like a steal with how nice the hotel actually ended up being. We would stay here again for sure!",nan,nan,ta_s1029
trip_advisor,"The Millennium Knickerbocker Hotel Chicago is the perfect place to stay for solo, business, couples or family travelers. This historic hotel has been beautifully updated and maintained.The hotel retains it's charming grander yet is modern. Above all, the staff are professional, helpful, knowledgeable and friendly. I have stayed in this hotel several times within the last 12 months, and again last week when I returned for the Chicago Auto Show.Upon arrival I was met by a doorman at my cab door immediately upon stopping. This was true upon every arrival and departure. I must give special recognition to your front desk representative, Simeon Cunninghamthat handled my arrival and departure. Cunningham was professional, knowledgeable and friendly. Upon my arrival he determined that I has not joined your loyalty program. He explained the program and its benefits to me and on the spot, with my agreement, enrolled me.My checkout by Cunningham was also a pleasurable experience. Housekeeping staff did an excellent job and are to be commended. The hotel and my suite was immaculate.Beds are superior quality as are towels and linens. Large screen TVs were appreciated. Floor to ceiling marble bathrooms are exceptional. I appreciate the fact that the honor snack/drink bar in the rooms are maintained by a person vs electronic charges which are such an annoyance in other hotels. I had breakfast, almost daily, in the lobby restaurant. The food in this restaurant was fresh, hot and very good -the prices were reasonable. With all this said about the restaurant, what made the true difference was the dedicated professional service staff. From the bus staff to the waiters all were attentive on each and every visit.I don't know there names, but I commend each of them. I have eaten in this restaurant on several stays at the hotel. I am pleased to acknowledge that I see the very same workers there on every visit. In the lobby, the bellman always speaks upon arrival or departure. One last item, the lobby bar serves very good drinks and food, again will excellent staff. After staying at most all of the better hotels along the Magnificent Mile I have found my home away from home! Thank you.",nan,nan,ta_s1031

The room was clean and quiet. We even were able to use the mini-fridge without worry of charge just for opening the door (although all the snacks & drinks were available for purchase.) They included a free use computer in the room, but we really didn't need it. Of course they held our luggage for the day once we checked out as we still had things to do. We had upgraded to a Superior Room with two doubles rather than the Standard and well worth it. (I think we paid only an extra $20 per night). Our beds were very comfortable.I love the ""old"" hotels with all their history and 'grandness and details'. Be sure to walk around and check out some of the old ballrooms and knooks & crannies. The only downside is usually smaller rooms, so it pays to upgrade to one a bit larger. Our bathroom was just fine ... clean with plenty of counter space. If you want monitors in your bathroom mirrors and everything brand new and huge, then this hotel is not for you. The hotel is 'comfortably' busy.... nothing too loud, too quiet, too busy. It was just right. We enjoyed the lounge area ...drinks and a quick bite in the evening. We had a package which included breakfast. It was good, although too pricey for me if it hadn't been included as part of the package. Nice crowd ... My ONLY complaint was that the elevators were disgusting (dirty and worn). It was shocking to me as everything else was perfect. Can't someone vacuum and use a bit of Windex? They badly needed painting.This location was great for us. We enjoyed dessert & coffee next door at the top of the Hancock. We enjoyed walking and people watching the Gold Coast in the evening. Enjoyed taking my morning coffee and walking across to the beach and having it all to myself. In the evening this area of Michigan is a bit less touristy and more local which we really enjoyed. We had done plenty of hectic touristy things during the day.I hope to stay again sometime. Clean and comfy old grand hotel in a wonderful location.",nan,nan,ta_s1033

The hotel is ideally located in the heart of the Gold Coast and just steps from the lake. The lobby is quaint and trendy and the rooms are tight, but well-appointed, clean, and comfortable. Despite its location, the hotel room was remarkably quiet. The only negative thing I have to say is that when I check in with the front desk staff by the name of Simeon he was very rude brief and not attentive however at the same time when my girlfriend check in next to me by the front desk agent I didn't quite get her name but she was African American she was very pleasant and professional and explain everything about what we needed to know with a SMILE..I wish I had interact with her because it really did make a Difference!!!",nan,nan,ta_s1035

Most memorably, a snafu arose after asking their concierge to book a tour. The snafu was perhaps due to my not being more clear, but they took responsibility. They not only verbally apologized, they followed up by sending chocolate strawberrys and champagne with a handwritten apology note. I was truly blown away and I travel often. This level of commitment to customer service was far beyond what I have come to expect. I will definitely stay at the Knickerbocker again the next time I'm in Chicago.",nan,nan,ta_s1037

The room was clean and quiet. We even were able to use the mini-fridge without worry of charge just for opening the door (although all the snacks & drinks were available for purchase.) They included a free use computer in the room, but we really didn't need it. Of course they held our luggage for the day once we checked out as we still had things to do. We had upgraded to a Superior Room with two doubles rather than the Standard and well worth it. (I think we paid only an extra $20 per night). Our beds were very comfortable.I love the ""old"" hotels with all their history and 'grandness and details'. Be sure to walk around and check out some of the old ballrooms and knooks & crannies. The only downside is usually smaller rooms, so it pays to upgrade to one a bit larger. Our bathroom was just fine ... clean with plenty of counter space. If you want monitors in your bathroom mirrors and everything brand new and huge, then this hotel is not for you. The hotel is 'comfortably' busy.... nothing too loud, too quiet, too busy. It was just right. We enjoyed the lounge area ...drinks and a quick bite in the evening. We had a package which included breakfast. It was good, although too pricey for me if it hadn't been included as part of the package. Nice crowd ... My ONLY complaint was that the elevators were disgusting (dirty and worn). It was shocking to me as everything else was perfect. Can't someone vacuum and use a bit of Windex? They badly needed painting.This location was great for us. We enjoyed dessert & coffee next door at the top of the Hancock. We enjoyed walking and people watching the Gold Coast in the evening.

My room had a connecting door to the neighbouring room which contained a very noisy guest. Avoid these if you want peace and quiet. I did not eat in the hotel apart from during the breaks in the conference. The food and coffee were pretty mediocre by European standards. I had a fantastic view from my room over the Chicago River and downtown. The hotel is well located and a short walk to the magic mile and with easy access to the riverside walk.

trip_advisor,"Not sure why this place thinks they deserve to be called ""one of the finest hotels in Chicago."" I've traveled extensively, and come to find that my overall impression of a hotel really boils down to the details. The rooms were dated (which is okay), but they were also dirty (not okay). The staff were friendly (great!), but clearly there were not enough of them.There were many things which indicated they were doing the best they could under less than ideal management.There was ALWAYS a long line at the front desk. One evening my key card stopped working, and I waited in line for over 20 minutes to get a replacement. Why on earth would you only staff the front desk for such a large hotel with one person, on a Saturday night?! When I finally made it to the desk. I was asked about my room. I replied that I was less than pleased with the cleanliness, and they offered to move me to another room or provide extra reward points. None of these were very appealing options after a long day, and the room never got any cleaner over the next few days. I was there for a conference, and I guess that the hotel had another event scheduled to start immediately after. While our meetings were still in progress, hotel staff began tearing down vendor equipment and setting up for the next event. This was done without notice, and again - the conference was still in progress as scheduled! Not only was the noise disruptive to the meeting, but several very expensive displays were damaged or destroyed when they were hastily placed on the floor by hotel staff. If you're thinking of scheduling a conference at this hotel, look elsewhere!",nan,nan,ta_s1074

Lots of restaurants are close by and in easy walking distance to get the bridge and take the Architecture boat cruise, see the Wrigley bldg, State Street and lots of other interesting places to visit.

My only complaint is that there isn't a fridge in the room & the ice bucket was too small to chill anything, much less a bottle of wine. Now this said, you could order a fridge for an additional $25 a day and that just wasn't worth it. Overall I would stay here again.

Safe as can be. It seemed a bit bland when we checked in, but as the days went by we liked it more and more - the decor grows on you, its more subtle than many. Sitting on the river is very pleasant, and the view is wonderful.

In fact, I think it may have improved sine my last visit.Unfortunately, the WiFi connection was the worst I have experienced at any hotel that claims it is a business-friendly hotel. My apple device was fine, but I had numerous problems with my Dell. Ironically, some IT support people at the Sheraton informed me that Apple devices had the problems logging on. The problem I had was in my room and not in the conference area. I had to make numerous calls regarding initial connectivity and inability to access initial webpages. I also would get kicked off as well. The issues appeared to be idiosyncratic and unpredictable.

The reception clerk was really smart and afforded me the free Wi-Fi. Big points. The room was quite lovely. With very nice modern art work.two small problems a toilet which didn't stop running.

trip_advisor,"I did quite a bit of research for this short family getaway. I chose this property based on location, reviews and price. I found a great rate for a club level room. I checked on the parking situation and had read that some reviewers arrived and found the self parking full. We really did not want to use valet, and I found the Ogden garage online for a very reasonable $29 per night prepaid. There is an underground walkway right to the hotel.Our room was on the 34th floor and viewed the river facing west. It was clean and well furnished but a bit small for our family of 3. When running water in our sink (or when the neighbors did) it sounded like it was rushing over Niagara Falls! We did also hear people talking in the hallway. They were not being loud, but there just isn't much noise isolation. The club lounge was nice and offered breakfast, evening snacks and soda or bottle water.*** OK, this one gets a star because it is important. The in-room (mini bar) food is placed on a sensor and if moved goes on your bill. Yep, we knocked over a $15 jar of cashews when placing a carry on bag on the counter area and it went on the bill. Fortunately I was reviewing the information provided in the binder and found details about how the system works. A quick call to the front desk and the charged was removed. However, I think this entire system is unacceptable and would be a complete nightmare for anyone with young children. The concierge staff was very helpful, and all employees were very polite and helpful. The location is very good. Wi Fi is included for club level or SPG members who book online. It covers up to 3 devices.",nan,nan,ta_s1091

Getting around was no problem as the front door staff are helpful when it comes to getting cabs. The hotel gym was good with a nice view of the city. All of the equipment was clean and maintained in working order. The overall appearance of the hotel was nice and the rooms were well appointed. There was a business center located within the hotel as well. We had one minor issue with the heating/air conditioning. However, one call to the front desk and 5 minutes later a building engineer was up to fix it. Overall, we would definitely stay here again while visiting Chicago.",nan,nan,ta_s1092

Walkable distance to Navy Pier and just around a $5.25 cab ride to Willis (formerly Sears) Tower. Also a short cab ride away from some great nightlife spots. The restaurant/bars at the hotel are expensive, but that is to be expected of the Chicago area. This hotel is in a great location; close to many tourist spots & shopping. Definitely recommend it!",nan,nan,ta_s1093
trip_advisor,"Hotel is located where the rest of the hotels are in the Loop, walking distance to Magnificient Mile. We booked two rooms at Club Level, but disappointed with the breakfast offered there. Furthermore, people forget that hotel is for sleeping not partying. 5 people in 3401 made such a noise at night security came in even before made complaint. The problem with almost all US hotels is their air conditioning systems in the room, they are so noisy. Furthermore, if you are staying on higher floors, there is fair chance that you will be exposed to main air conditioning units' noises of lower buildings which are located on top of their building. Therefore there is always a noise, Sheraton in this context was not an exception.",nan,nan,ta_s1094
trip_advisor,"Usually my idea of what service should be from a hotel and what is actually experienced is vastly different. The Sheraton Towers however, really has service that is fantastic. When we arrived, I thought by the crowded lobby full of student athletes and families that I was again going to be put through a convention style stay. But the check in process was quick, friendly and welcoming. The entire place looks, smells and feels new. The rooms are very clean and everything worked correctly. I called to the desk to have the mini bar removed because it is a motion sensored tray which I felt was too tempting for my children. After the first day, I asked for an upgraded room because the current one just was not large enough for our family. Not the hotels fault, it was mine for not booking two rooms. Rory at the customer service desk was so professional and went out of his way to help figure out my problem. He told me to go out and when I returned, everything would be taken care of. Now usually, when I ask for anything at a hotel, I am told the same thing yet disappointed when I return. This was not the case with Rory at the Sheraton. When I returned, he said he valued my gold status as a starwood member and upgraded us to a very nice suite. The service in the Chi bar was attentive and friendly. Housekeeping was very friendly telling us to have a nice stay with our family. When we checked out, Michael was helpful and smiling telling us to remember the Sheraton for a visit in the future. In all, the employees seem to enjoy their job and look for opportunities to assist guests.",nan,nan,ta_s1095
trip_advisor,"My Fiancee and I stayed over the holiday weekend while she was in town for a Volleyball tournament. Almost all the guests were there for the same tournament, which meant it was filled with teenage girls. Despite this, the rooms were never too loud. The best part of this hotel is the location. It is a half-mile to Navy Pier or the Lakefront Trail for a run or bike ride. It was walking distance to Grant Park, the Bean, and Michigan Avenue shopping. To get to further places like McCormick, we took an Uber, never more than $10. The room was comfortable and clean. The bathroom was updated and functional. The bed was comfortable, though in our double rooms they were a full and not queen. The only complaint was room temperature. I like it cool when I sleep. It was 40s-50s outside and I turned the thermostat down to 66 (the lowest), but the room would still get warm overnight.",nan,nan,ta_s1096
trip_advisor,"This is my 4th stay at the Sheraton Towers and always enjoyed it. However, Id never used the Club Lounge before. What a pleasant surprise. Lounge is beautiful-as you'd expect. But, what makes it great is the hostess Connie, who is so friendly and attentive...she kept everyone smiling (young kids, adults, solo travelers like myself). Imagine going to a beautiful upscale home for a gathering, and the lady of the house is a joy...making you feel like the home is yours. Truly a great experience. I recall her going around telling people what was coming out and when, just like one would do hosting a gathering of friends at home! Just cant say enough. Kudos to hotel mgmt. for matching this great hostess with such a lovely lounge...icing on the cake!",nan,nan,ta_s1097
trip_advisor,"Before retiring, I often stayed in this hotel on business. It always was a pleasant experience. Since that was more than ten years ago, we were very happy to find that it had not declined in any way. Our room had obviously been recently refurbished and was in excellent condition. Although we had booked it for a very reasonable price, we were pleased to find that it was a corner room with lots of space and a couch and easy chair.Most outstanding was the staff; from the front desk clerk to the maid who showed me where the ice machine was, every staff member we met was courteous, pleasant and anxious to help us. What a pleasure.Located close to the loop and to N. Michigan Ave, this is a perfect place to sat in downtown Chicago.",nan,nan,ta_s1098
trip_advisor,"The Sherston Chicago Hotel and Towers is nice hotel in a great downtow location. The hotel is near Michigan Avenue, River Nirth, Navy Pier and Grant Park giving a visitor easy access to shopping, restaraunts, attractions and museums. My wife and I have been frequent visitors over the last 15 years and have always been treated well by everyone at the hotel. For location and price, it is a good value. The rooms are nicely furnished and even the ""base"" rooms are decent size. The hotel has river, city and lake views and any of the three are good on sunny days and clear nights (although the river view towards Trump Hotel is a recommended favorite). Shula's Steakhouse is a high quality restaurant for a special dinner out. We always look forward to our visits.",nan,nan,ta_s1099
trip_advisor,"LOCATION wise, I found it to be perfect for what we wanted to see/do in the city (typical first time visit-Bean, Museum Campus, Wrigley, Navy Pier). Really only walkable to Bean/Navy Pier, but Uber was easy and cabs were plenty. It was a holiday and I had no patience with holiday el schedules with only 24 hours in the city. The Westins are better placed, but not to the tune of $100 better for the night.PRICE/ROOM, as I mentioned it was $109. No brainer for the location and even with $61 valet (on site self park is $51), it's more than reasonable. We had a north-facing view on the 25th floor that had a peekaboo view of the Lake, which was nice. Typical Sheraton amenities/beds and very comfortable. Only quibble was minor. It's a safe bet that if two doubles are booked, it's two people staying. One washcloth and hand towel, really? When I found the maid and got one she said that's standard ""as it's a business hotel"". That makes no sense, but whatever. Notes: the gift shop referenced on their site/in the books in the room doesn't exist. It's possible that they may build one out but there's none there now and staff couldn't tell me when it was last open. Not a huge issue as there's a CVS in the Radisson right across the Columbus Ave. Bridge. Maybe 5m walk. About 5-10m walk is the Aon Center whose basement has Starbucks, Dunkin', Au Bon Pain, etc. which are good for breakfast if you don't have lounge access/want hotel food. We did room service as there wasn't much open for easter dinner having cut off service at a late brunch.",nan,nan,ta_s1100
trip_advisor,"Good location - right on the Chicago river, great spot for watching the river being dyed green. Close - walking distance to the navy pier, shopping, etc. The staff were very helpful and housekeeping was spot on. I had a king room on the 32nd floor. The view was okay, just a peek at the water. Would definitely encourage you to look at the 33rd floor looking at the river. We opted to include the club lounge. Breakfast was pretty standard, but the h'ors de oeuvres from 5-7 were a very nice bonus.",nan,nan,ta_s1101
trip_advisor,"We stayed at the Sheraton Hotel and Towers over the Easter Holiday weekend. The staff there was excellent. Our double bed Club level room was wonderful. I would like to particularly mention the staff at the ""Club"" area. If you stay in a Club level room you have access to this room where they complimentary serve continental breakfast and nightly light appetizers. You can also purchase drinks as well. Connie Alex was there Sunday night and was so nice, accommodating and just overall wonderful. We would definitely stay there again and in another club level room.",nan,nan,ta_s1102
trip_advisor,"While the hotel itself is quite nice, what really stands out at the Sheraton is the staff. At a very large (>1000 rooms) hotel, I often see fairly impersonal service or feel like I'm treated just like one of the many. Not so at the Sheraton Chicago. I arrived VERY early in the day (approximately 8:30AM) and went to the desk hoping to store my luggage until I could check in later. To my surprise, the very friendly front desk woman was able to put me in a room immediately. She even asked several questions so she could find the right room. I had reserved a king room, and she could accomodate that but only on a low floor, and offered a room on the top floor with two doubles--to complement the gorgeous club lounge access she also provided me. The next day when I checked out, I checked out with the same very friendly young woman who commented that I had just arrived and was already leaving! She told me ""it was nice to meet you""--and I really believed she was sincere! The luggage storage was very easy as well and the woman who retrieved my luggage for me was also very genuine in that she hoped I had a great stay. I travel to Chicago a LOT for work, and I will always look to stay at the Sheraton towers when I am able to.",nan,nan,ta_s1103
trip_advisor,"Had the opportunity to stay here while in the city for a conference. Amenities are top quality. Pool and gym were amazing. Four of us were in different rooms on different floors in different areas of the hotel but every one of us had an amazing view. The bed is crazy comfortable, water pressure perfect and the desk area spacious enough for me to spread my work out. I had concerns about internet speed from other reviews but that was never an issue. Located right on the river and withing walking distance of everything we wanted to see and do!",nan,nan,ta_s1105
trip_advisor,I am a life imePlatium member. I drove up in my rented automobile and from the moment I arrived at the doortestaffould to have been more accommodating and pleasant. I was greated by the doorman as if I was the most important person he had greeted that day. The valet service was excellent though a little expensive. I moved on to the front desk and the young woman who worked with me did everything possible to help me with the best available room on a high floor. The Club Lounge was staffed by the most friendly people a well. I would recommend this property in a second to any of my friends.,nan,nan,ta_s1106
trip_advisor,"In town for a week for a conference at McCormick. This hotel provided me all the support I needed for a busy conference schedule and precious little time to discover Chicago. The front desk and concierge staff were positive, efficient and helpful. Suggestions for restaurants and activities matched my descriptions of how much time I had and what I hoped to do exactly.The room was well kept and had a great view of the city. The pillows were phenomenal (seriously). Very comfortable room with all I needed.I will look this place up as a first choice the next time I am in town. Great location, great hotel.",nan,nan,ta_s1107
trip_advisor,"I stayed two nights for business. Check in is efficient, the location is very nice. Had a room with a view of the Navy Pier, the bed was comfortable, room was reasonable, location is very good. It's just that, for a Sheraton, you kind of expect a bit more in terms of room quality and hotel upkeep. The room is pretty dark, there was no overhead lighting, just two lamps and a desk lamp (one light over the doorway). And one thing that struck me, and this hotel is not alone here, but it was very apparent here: Food trays left in the hall. After people finish their room service meals, they put the tray out in the hall ... in this case, there was a tray out when I checked in, and it was still there late the next morning. And there were several throughout the day. Can't imagine it would cost much to hire a person to make the rounds on each floor with a cart and retrieve the trays, they make the hallways smell of burgers and food. There's nothing to hate about this hotel, but a big city Sheraton can do better than this.",nan,nan,ta_s1108
trip_advisor,"I checked in for a one night stay, the room was quiet, had a great view and was located directly on the river. Unfortunately I was there in the winter bit I am sure that in the summer I would have enjoyed this hotel a lot more. The billing department had an error on my bill which somehow my rental car was charged twice for parking. It was supposed to be in and out privileges for $49.00 per day which I didnt even use but they credited me back within 48 hours.  The only drawback was my late arrival left me very few food options after 11:00 local time.",nan,nan,ta_s1109
trip_advisor,"I rarely write reviews, but my recent experience at the Chicago Sheraton during a national conference was exceptional. A very nice desk clerk, Nia, chose a conference room for me with a beautiful view of the city. My stay was even more enjoyable because I had a clear view of the dyeing of the river for St. Patruck's Day. The concierge suggested excellent restaurants and sites to see based on my interests. The room was quiet and comfortable, and all staff members were friendly and efficient. For an enjoyable stay in Chicago, I highly recommend the Sheraton.",nan,nan,ta_s1110
trip_advisor,"Everything was great, and it gets even better when you request their assistance to enjoy the region. All the people in concierge are very kind and dedicated, but if you have the chance to talk to Marisa, your experience will not be comparable to anything you ever had. She is able to capture your expectations and point the exact places that will perfectly fit for you, a short stay in Chicago become na amazing experience. Congratulations to the hotel!! And those who are not sure where to stay, trust me, this is the right place (location, view, facilities and service).",nan,nan,ta_s1111
trip_advisor,"This hotel is easily accessible from Midway Airport and conveniently located near shopping and Chicago landmarks--walkable, or easy by cab. From our arrival with assistance from Amsale Kassa at the reception desk to an initial interaction with a housingkeeping staff member in the hall, everything has extremely well coordinated. I arrived for a conference with student participants, and all spoke of how easily we got started for an honorary society conference. The furnishing of rooms was modern in style with an excellent desk lamp and other lighting, excellent tv, and convenient full length mirror. I travel regularly to conferences in Marriott, Hilton and Hyatt hotels, and find this Sheraton comparable and staff extraordinarily cooperative",nan,nan,ta_s1113
trip_advisor,"I called early to see if I could get an early check in and they were very quick to say they could accommodate my request! Upon arrival, I was given an upgrade to a beautiful room on the 28th floor with the most gorgeous view of the city, the river, and the lake. It was very apparent that they were concerned that our stay was wonderful. I will definitely stay there again! :) ONLY downside is that there isn't a hot tub, but that's not a huge deal.",nan,nan,ta_s1114
trip_advisor,"The Sheraton was very busy with a large convention. The staff that I had an opportunity to interact with were all very friendly and accommodating. I requested a high floor room and was assigned to the 30th floor. Great view! I could see the lake, the river and many buildings surrounding the hotel. A lot of shopping and restaurants nearby. Several restaurants in the hotel as well. The rooms were clean and spacious, the staff was friendly and service was great. I would definitely stay here again.",nan,nan,ta_s1115
trip_advisor,"I have stayed at the Sheraton twice now during my visits to Chicago and both visits have been a pleasure due to the atmosphere and hospitality of the staff. You are greeted with a smile and service the second you pull up; (despite the frigid temps; as both trips were in February). The front desk staff are just as ""bubbily"" and willing to accommodate you anyway they can! When you are ready to leave the hotel to go shopping, site seeing, etc; they ""whistle for the cab"" shows up right a away to head to your destination. Very efficient service! I lack patience much of the time, and they serve you well here from door to room! The Sheraton has a business feel to it as for those who stay here, but caters to all. Bar service is good, but when they get packed tend to wait a little for service. I'm not that big into pools, but if you are it is small, but warm in there so was great while I watched my daughters swim. Nice gym. I have not eaten there so can not tell you much about that, I did get coffee several times from the coffee shop; it is expensive (I think I can get real Starbucks cheaper; but you're in Chicago and at a hotel)......Overall great experience and CLEAN rooms!",nan,nan,ta_s1116
trip_advisor,"I'll start by mentioning the good things - location was definitely great, I was able to check in early and the staff was attentive and efficient. Having said that, there were a couple of things that put me off. One, when I entered my room and was about to get in to bed, there was a hair right in front of me. Then, when I looked closely at the bed cover, there were little hairs on it too. This really put me off. Second, I fell a little sick the next day and needed a pain killer/fever reducer. The property didn't have anything. I had to ask a friend to come to the city with some medicine. I would expect a hotel of this standard to have a first aid kit as well as some basic medication at the property. I thought this hotel was very average and didn't live up to the Sheraton brand in my opinion.",nan,nan,ta_s1117
trip_advisor,"We are from the suburs and we love spend weekends at the city. we always stay here because its a wonderful resort and a great location. Navy Peir within a few blocks, Movies within a block. and local pub bar next to it!! ohh and River is and the view is priceless. The pool is pretty good and the Gym is great with showers and lockers.",nan,nan,ta_s1118
trip_advisor,I have stayed here every year for five years for an annual convention in Chicago. The location is perfect walking distance to miracle mile to Navy pier and even the beachfront and aquarium if you're ambitious. The facility is huge and the rooms are very nice especially if you get upgraded to a suite. Shula's restaurant in the lobby is excellent and they have a very large bar for socializing after work. There's nothing spectacular about the hotel but you will get consistently good service a nice room and close to everything.,nan,nan,ta_s1119
trip_advisor,"What an indulgent weekend! The staff and customer service were unbelievable! I am new to staying in such lovely environments--and to have doormen, bellhops, taxi service! Loved the destination advice and the little things! The Sheraton was SOOO convenient to places of interest--Magnificent Mile, Navy Pier, we took a taxi to the Red Line/Subway start at Grand and went to Chinatown with no hassle! The girls were able to catch a taxi from the hotel to The Bean and tour the park. SO easy to get everywhere, and all we had to do was ask the Concierge or the doormen! Check in was a breeze, the view from our room showed the Lake and the River, as well as the square outside the hotel. The only downside was the cost of parking for the two nights--there isnt a discount for being a hotel guest (at ANY of the hotels on the square).",nan,nan,ta_s1120
trip_advisor,"My cousin and I visited this hotel on a Girl's Trip. It was great. Can't beat the location. It's close to the Magnificent Mile, the Chicago River Architecture Cruise and it's accessible to transit (which we took to Wrigley Field). Also was walking distance to many great restaurants. Only fault was that wifi was only in the common areas, not the rooms. Overall, this was a great spot to stay in Chi Town.",nan,nan,ta_s1121
trip_advisor,"Very close to the Must See Chicago Spots! Rooms were modern and clean. This hotel is very very big. Make sure you ask for a hotel room away from the elevator. Stop in the lounge for appetizers and cocktails, great views from up there.Great restaurants and bars within walking distance. There is a lot of construction going on so be careful walking at night.",nan,nan,ta_s1122
trip_advisor,"Stayed here at start of January after the Holiday season. Good Points: The hotel is conveniently located and the view from our room was stunning. We got an upgrade because it was a very quiet time for the hotel. The room was very good, no complaints at all. Bed was comfortable. The staff were very helpful.Bad Points: Wi-Fi is quite expensive. Also, the hotel bar closed early-ish (about 11pm) when we were there so we couldn't get a drink after we came back from dinner on a couple of occasions. I thought this was quite unusual for a hotel of this size, although it may be an American thing as I am from the UK.",nan,nan,ta_s1123
trip_advisor,"We ventured into the Sheraton during the Cubs Convention, taking a deep breath and expecting barely controlled chaos. What we got instead was a very strong performance by a well prepared staff from the restaurants, to the housekeepers and the front desk. With a huge migration of non-guests in the hotel for the weekend, one might expect curt exchanges and abrupt service. None of that came to pass as the hotel handled the rush with aplomb and good humor, the food in the various venues was quite good, served timely and the waitstaff was friendly and efficient. The front desk answered our questions, directed us accurately in workings of the event and checked us out quickly. Bell and door staff were efficient and knowledgeable as well. All in all, what we feared -- headaches -- did not materialize. Instead we had a great time, with a great experience. We have stayed at the 5-stars on near the Water Tower. While not quite that high end, this is a well run, friendly and efficient hotel and a great alternative to the $$$ others.",nan,nan,ta_s1124
trip_advisor,"I have stayed at this hotel a couple of different times with my Girlfriend, was the first time I brought my kids here, was our ""Christmas"" trip. Overall was a very pleasant experience. I love the hotel bar, not the prices though. The atmosphere is wonderful, can sit and have a cocktail while you look out toward the river, very peaceful and serene. Room was very tight for the 4 of us, but worked fine as we only stayed one day. Staff is always great here, never an issue. As other reviews have mentioned, prices for the restaurants and room service are extremely high, make sure to read the fine print if you are going to order room service, 18% added with a $3.75 delivery, price you pay for convenience I suppose. I will definitely stay here again. Staff and location are unbeatable.",nan,nan,ta_s1125

The rooms are comfortable and roomy.There are several restaurants nearby within walking distance and several inside the hotel itself.I would give the hotel 5 stars if they had vending machines available. There are ice machines, but the only vending machines in the building are behind closed doors for their employees. If you want a snack or soda you can purchase them from the mini bar in your room at extravagant prices, or in the cafe' downstairs, for a little cheaper. While there are computers and printers available in the cafe' as well as free wifi, if you want wifi in your room you will have to pay $14-$19 per night.The staff were extremely helpful and friendly. After a day of checking all souvenir shops for an item without luck, the concierge, Demetrius pointed us in the correct direction. Another concierge took care of exchanging our Amtrak tickets for an earlier time. Overall, it was a great stay.",nan,nan,ta_s1127
trip_advisor,Upon arriving the property was clean and beautiful. The front desk was very nice and even upgraded us to the club level since we were there to celebrate our 10th wedding anniversary. Our room had a beautiful view of the river and the lake. We were so happy and comfortable. They are one block off of Michigan Ave on the river so everything was right near by. My wife and I highly recommend staying here.,nan,nan,ta_s1128
trip_advisor,"I stayed at this Sheraton for 4 nights (would have been 3 but for the blizzard) during a conference. Overall it was an excellent experience, and I'd certainly stay here again when in Chicago. The 2 standout aspects included the customer service, particularly registration desk staff (Alexandra) who kindly and efficiently fixed an error I'd made in registration, and the gentleman at the registration desk (sorry did not get name) who extended my stay with no hassles when I had to deal with a plane cancellation. I even got to keep my room, which was the other standout aspect. If a room is available in the east side of the hotel, at the end of the hall, take it! Magnificent views of the river and Lake Michigan, and an interesting wedge-shaped room layout which is a refreshing change from the ordinary box-shaped hotel room. Nothing wrong with the standard rooms, but the end rooms (room numbers end with 50-54, I believe) are lovely. The lobby area was very comfortable, and the fitness center was large and well-equipped. The pool looked nice, though a spa-hot tub would be a welcome addition. Nice locker rooms in the fitness area, including a sauna. This hotel is a ways from the El and not convenient for those who prefer public transportation, but is right on the Riverwalk and a 10-minute walk from Navy Pier, also close to the Magnificent Mile, so a great location from which to sightsee and explore. The experience was short of 5-star; I didn't like the minibar, and mine had a cabinet door that would not stay shut. I had issues with the wifi (though that might have been my computer, at least in part - though I've seen other wifi complaints in the reviews). The bed itself was very comfy but the sheets felt papery and not soft. The furnishings had a few dents and dings here and there. On the other hand, the provision of a bathrobe and the nice toiletry selection were appreciated.Front desk staff offered the option to forgo housekeeping service in return for frequent traveler points or a voucher toward food/services. This was an interesting option and worked out well for me. Housekeeping staff cheerfully restocked my coffee, towels, and toiletries at my request, but I didn't really need to have my bed made each day anyway.All in all, a very nice experience that would just need a couple adjustments to be top-notch. Thank you for a great stay.",nan,nan,ta_s1129

Peeling veneer on cabinet, etc. Maid service was excellent (except forgetting the liner in the ice bucket one day).

They'll be happy to rent you a fridge to use if you need one. Good quality TV & iron. Don't know why these nice hotels don't invest in a higher grade TP.Customer service was very good -- Had a couple of erroneous charges on bill and the front desk happily removed them.Used the gym all four mornings.

trip_advisor,"I stayed here on business for one night, and was impressed. The real highlights were the friendly staff, the fantastic gym (great views, circuit machines, cold towels) and the great, comfortable room. The coffee bar was a little anonymous and meh, but when you're in a good location like this, it's not a huge deal. I also was annoyed a bit when my card mysteriously demagnetized after a visit to the gym and I had to go to the lobby in my workout clothes. Wasn't the end of the world, and it happens so often with those darn card keys. All in all though--great experience and I would gladly stay here again for business or pleasure.

trip_advisor,"I recently stayed at this property for a conference I was attending earlier this week. When you step into a premium property, you expect a higher level of service. You also expect to see and feel that premium/luxury experience throughout your stay. This property definitely delivered on providing that experience. The property is well appointed throughout the property from the lobby to your room to the dining rooms. The staff is very friendly and professional. My room offered everything I needed. It was very quiet and had great bedding so I got a good night's rest. All of the food I ate at the conference events was great. I also especially enjoyed eating breakfast the last day in the Hotel restaurant. They made a great omelet and the coffee was great too. The only slight criticism I had was that the High speed Wi-FI internet service was a little spotty at times.

We have stayed every year at the Sheraton and would not consider going to any other hotel. Every single person that is employed there goes out of their way to make our visit a wonderful experience. Each time we call housekeeping for extra coffee/creamers/towels/luggage rack, whatever the need is, they immediately bring it to our room! The front desk is very professional yet friendly. We always stop by the concierge desk to ask about attractions or restaurants, Marisa went above and beyond to help us book a tour! She has been there for several years and always so kind and helpful!

I would say the only thing that I was slightly disappointed with was the pillows. They could have been more firm. I slept ok, but not because of the bed or noise. I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone staying in Chicago. It is a great location in Chicago. The hotel worked very hard to help people. I did not get to use everything at the hotel because I was there for the convention, but I am confident that anything I needed would have been fulfilled. The rooms were very clean and welcoming. The room was comfortable and quiet in regards to so many people staying for the convention. I would stay at this hotel again for the convention or otherwise if I was going to be in Chicago.",nan,nan,ta_s1137
trip_advisor,"I stayed at the Sheraton Chicago Towers for two nights as a solo business traveller attending a conference on the property. The hotel has a great location right at the bottom of the Magnificent Mile, with ample shopping, restaurants, and nightlife either a short walk or cab ride away. It's a new building, so everything is comfortable and up-to-date as one would expect of accommodations at this price range, but there isn't much charm or ambience otherwise.Unfortunately, my stay was marred by a series of service issues that added up to a generally disappointing stay. At the check-in counter, I was assigned to an ADA-compliant room without any choice or advice as to what this would mean - I'm not a particularly fussy traveller, but two things I do appreciate on a business trip are ample counter space in the bathroom, and a deep tub. Both of these, of course, were missing from the specialized room.Even worse, the previous occupant had left a takeout container in the minibar fridge - some kind of leftover seafood that had gone bad and started to stink up the room. I was extremely surprised that it hadn't been caught at some point by housekeeping, because it was pretty obvious from the smell that something wasn't right.Since I had a long flight, a late arrival, and early meetings the next morning, I didn't bother trying to complain or switch rooms - I left the trash outside and called it a night. The next morning, my room service breakfast arrived late and cold - I had to leave most of it behind to make my first appointment.I don't expect much charm, ambience, or romance from a city hotel that clearly caters to the business and convention trade - but at this price, these properties should be immaculate and run like clockwork. This clearly wasn't the case during my stay, hence the negative review.",nan,nan,ta_s1138
trip_advisor,"Attended the Illinois State Bar Association again this year at the Sheraton, our traditional location for this meeting. This takes place during the second weekend in December, beginning on Thursday. I arrived late Friday afternoon for a meeting on Saturday morning. The hotel is always decorated for Christmas by this time and it is always done tastefully and in a way that gives you a warm, cozy feeling. The service at the front desk was prompt and pleasant, despite the large crowd. The room was somewhat small but elegant and comfortable. Two people can stay there comfortably, as long as they don't spend a lot of time in the room. The view from the higher floors is spectacular. The meeting rooms are also comfortable and well maintained. I always look forward to staying at the Sheraton and have not been disappointed yet.",nan,nan,ta_s1139
trip_advisor,"The Sheraton is large and offers great location and has several nice restaurants. Escalators are great to travel from floor to floor. I was there for a convention and the hotel was crowded, but things ran smoothly and there were a lot of staff on hand. Beautiful view of Chicago Skyline and River.",nan,nan,ta_s1140
trip_advisor,"We were pleasantly surprised by all of the staff. Very welcoming. The front desk was very helpful as were all the staff pretty much. The folks outside taking cars were under a lot of stress as this was for a convention but they smiled and took the bags and parked the car! The food was great downstairs and the service was excellent. I would come again. Room was very clean and neat and the mattress and bedding was pretty new as it was really quite comfy. Only downside, no free wi fi. Most hotels offer that now.",nan,nan,ta_s1141
trip_advisor,"Stayed here for the 2015 Cubs Convention. The location is fantastic. The parking situation is expensive ($51 per night) but there are slightly cheaper options within walking distance. Biggest issue was the noise. Thin walls. We could clearly hear the people in the adjacent room talking at normal volume. Everytime someone flushed a toilet or turned on a faucet above us or adjacent to us, you could hear it very loudly in our room. Other issue was the mini bar -- there's a fridge in the room but it's stocked with over-priced items. If you take any of the items out to put in your own soda, etc to keep it cold -- the sensor will go off and you'll be charged for those items. They took them off our bill, but it was still a hassle. Also, no free wi-fi in the room. For the $220+ per night I paid, I'm thinking free wi-fi isn't too much to ask for. Bar was expensive -- $31 but two shots. Rooms are nothing special, but beds were comfortable and they had good pay per view options.",nan,nan,ta_s1142
trip_advisor,"I had several problems with this hotel for their convention amenities.1. During the opening ceremonies, they had a lot of people all trying to get in an area that had limited access/exit. Safety wise this was at worst dangerous, at the least, illegal and a fire hazard. Had there been an emergency there was no way the staff could have cleared the room safely.2. The hotel does not have the layout to handle the 7,000 guests much less the vendors that also accompany the convention.",nan,nan,ta_s1143
trip_advisor,"Wonderfully located on the Chicago River in a walk-to-everything location, The Sheraton is a well appointed hotel with all the amenities one could want in a quality hotel. Good restaurants and bars in the hotel, but many, many more right outside the door. Our room on the 26th floor had a wonderful view of the city. Clean, great bedding, great value!",nan,nan,ta_s1144
trip_advisor,"This visit was just as good as the last and maybe even a bit better. Our greeting by the front desk was warm & inviting. It set the tone for the next 3 days. I highly recommend this property. If you have the opportunity to book the Club Level rooms, you will be thankful that you did. The Club Lounge breakfast is great and the ability to get soda and water 24/7 is a nice feature. The complimentary wifi on this level is another great feature.The lobby is decorated for the Christmas Season and features a beautiful tree.",nan,nan,ta_s1145
trip_advisor,"My husband and I are SPG members and we visited this hotel last year and while the property was great, we had some not so welcoming service at one of hotel restraunts. I had emailed the hotel and they took care of everything almost immediatly. When we decided to return, I reached out to one of the directors, Vasileios, who upgraded our room, along with giving us club lounge access along with other accomodations. Let me say, our room was spectacular. We had a suite overlooking the city. There was a lovely bottle of wine with strawberries waiting for us. When we checked in, we were greated by Alexandra Gale who made us feel like we were so very welcome. She was just amazing. We ate at Shulas the first night and Kari provided us fabulous service. They were a little busy, but we also ate around 730pm. We ate breakfast at the Bistro and the food was really good. We were greeted and sat at a table fairly quickly. The service was top notch. The hotel is within walking distance to almost everything. Such an amazing location. My husband and I have stayed at several Sheratons between Florida, Chicago and Michigan and I have to say that the Sheraton in Chicago is our favorite. We cannot wait to come back. We are already planning our return. I refuse to stay anywhere else when we come to the city. The hospitality here is one of a kind. They truely care about their customers.",nan,nan,ta_s1146
trip_advisor,"We stay here often and are always impressed but tonight we were blown away by two employees in the club level. We just checked in today and are here for a few nights but this review is for the club level service we received dec 20 sat. Jorge, I think F&B manager and Connie Alex were the 2 employees we saw. Starting at 5 the club level was so packed and these 2 seamlessly took care of the hordes people lining up to get the appetizers. Like I said this is our go to hotel and we have never seen so many people at once. We have seen Connie before and she always makes everyone feel welcome. She is a gem to the hotel. We always encounter great employees here but after seeing how they handled this I needed to leave a review for them. I recommend upgrading while at this property always worth it!",nan,nan,ta_s1147
trip_advisor,"My professional association, the Illinois State Bar Association, has conducted its annual mid-year meeting for decades at the Sheraton. I've come to know staff from the doorman to the bellman to the servers in the bar. It's a comfortable place, close to just about anything in Chicago. The rooms are well appointed, functional. Whether it's either a large, professional meeting or simply a week-end getaway to the Windy City, the Sheraton Hotel & Towers should be in ones travel plans.",nan,nan,ta_s1148
trip_advisor,"My Wife and I just celebrated our 49th Wedding Anniversary and we usually spend a few days Downtown every year enjoying all the Christmas decorations. We always stay at the Sheraton Chicago Hotel and Towers (we always ask for a room with a ""River View"") and the Sheraton Again treated us like Royalty. Everyone from the Doorman to the nice person that kept our room neat were just SUPER. The Front Desk Crew were outstanding as always. Thank You Again for a Wonderful visit.",nan,nan,ta_s1149
trip_advisor,"I had the opportunity to stay at the Sheraton Towers from Dec. 3-8 for a Dental Implant Conference. First, the location of the hotel was primo. Easy walking distance to many fine restaurants, shopping, and Chicago must see locations (John Hancock Bldg, Water Tower, etc.). Check-in was easy, friendly, and the lobby was nicely decorated for the Christmas. Our room was not ready, but they handled our luggage and provided access to the lounge. Our room was top notch. We were on the 35 floor and had a great view of the lake and the Navy pier. The room was inviting and comfortable. Plenty of room to spread out, work at the desk, or just watch TV. No problem sleeping on those beds-very comfortable! Everyone we encountered at the hotel was very helpful, especially the doorman. He provided many excellent dining recommendations and directions. The concierge was also very helpful, but usually busier than the doorman. The restaurants provided excellent choices and the food was very good! Better than one expects from many hotels. I was a repeat offender and enjoyed each meal. The bar was centrally located with an excellent wine list. I had reservations for another meeting at the Swissotel midweek, but cancelled them to stay at the Sheraton and walk to the other hotel for the meeting. Being a Gold Member at the Marriott and Hilton Hotels, I was skeptical about staying at the Sheraton. No more! I will make the Sheraton my hotel of choice in Chicago. Thanks to everyone who made our visit exceptional. Cannot wait to return.",nan,nan,ta_s1150
trip_advisor,"The customer service at this hotel is delightful. The doorman was very welcoming as we exited our vehicle. Adam at Check In was more than accommodating. He noticed my request for extra pillows and asked if I would prefer feathered pillows. When he found out I was in town for the Hot Chocolate Race he offered us a 1pm check out which I gladly accepted. He even gave me a coupon for a free drink and snack at the hotel. Thank you so much Adam for your hospitality. As we entered our very clean room with lots of pillows we were thrilled with the beautiful view of the river and the park down below, the lake to our left and the buildings which were so beautifully lit at night. The next morning after our race the staff gave us information so we could get a cart sent to our room for our bags. The sweetest man came to our room with the cart and brought it down for us as well as helping us get to our valet parking. This hotel really understands customer service and I will most definitely stay again. By the way, the beds were very comfortable and halls were quiet. I slept like a baby. It is also located near shopping, Navy Pier, Michigan Avenue, architecturally significant buildings and the architectural tour (which I highly recommend) and not far from Millennium Park.",nan,nan,ta_s1152
trip_advisor,"I traveled with a co worker for 3 nights/ 4 days for a conference held at the hotel. The rooms were clean and nice but a little small. The shower water pressure was very good! Although it almost hurt if you stayed in too long. The view from our room (1431) was wonderful! We had a full view of the river and even Lake Michigan off in the distance. The conference rooms were nice and the escalators made it easy to get from floor to floor because it seemed like everything was on a different floor. The only complaint I have is that I don't like the refrigerator in the room that is full of beverages for purchase. We had no room to keep our personal soda or water. And the ice bucket they provided was too small to use to keep our drinks cold. Overall the staff was friendly and the service we received was good. We also enjoyed our breakfast from the cafe there in the morning. Although service was a little slow the food was delicious! If I were to come again I may stay right on Michigan Ave, instead of a few streets over, since that is where we spent most of our free time.",nan,nan,ta_s1153
trip_advisor,"Just a short thank you note to Rhea Alejo - I travel to Chicago quite frequently due to business and have the choice between a very nice Westin on Magnificient Mile, the two W's or even another Westin in River North. The Sheraton Chicago Hotel and Towers has always exceeded my expectations and you have contributed to that. I will continue to book this hotel due to the warm hospitality you have shown me. Apart from the fantastic amenities you offer (Lounge, great Bar, great restaurant), it is associated like you who make this hotel one of choice, especially for SPG members.Thank you!",nan,nan,ta_s1154
trip_advisor,"Lobby is big, exciting, warm and inviting. If you live in New York, LA or Michigan you will enjoy the property. The front desk staff was warm and the wait time to get to the desk was instant. Amsale Kassa could not have been more perfect checking us in, her smile matched the hotels overall feel. Thank you Starwood for ensuring my visit to Chicago was perfect especially as it was my husbands birthday weekend!",nan,nan,ta_s1155
trip_advisor,"Booked five rooms for a group going to see Notre Dame in South Bend making Chicago our home base for the weekend. As a group we all are SPG members but all of us did not receive upgraded rooms to the club level very disappointing especially since being a member the longest pushed my group to enroll and choose this hotel. The location is prime for the river walk and grant park, mag. mile, navy pier, excellent location. The hotel is very large and quite often is booked with conventions so it is very busy. The concierge desk are staffed with more than one person and do an excellent job, the valet guys are very friendly and excellent at directions and tips on where to go. Check in was smooth for me as Galen immediatley recognized me as loyal spg member and upgraded me to a club level room extending us a late check out as needed for our group. The room was clean and well appointed and the view up river from the 32 floor looking at the beautiful trump tower was magnificent. Only issue we had was and it was very disappointing was the adjacent room was full of loud teenage girls and mean loud you could hear them down the hall as we approached our room, of course you can imagine when we got into our room how loud and disturbing it was. The only visit from security didn't have the impact we had hoped as the rest of the night was a nightmare and of course no sleep. The whole next day I was a zombie. Overall I highly recommend this hotel for its location and excellent staff minus the security team of course. Thanks Sheraton we will be coming back for our next trip in the summer.",nan,nan,ta_s1156
trip_advisor,"First time in Chicago and we spent three days at this hotel. It is located along the 'River Walk' close to the architectural cruise ports and only a 5-min walk to the 'Magnificent Mile' packed with high-end shopping and restaurants. Key highlights include:Pros- Location, location, location- Amazing view of downtown Chicago from virtually every angle of the hotel; definitely ask for a room on a high floor- One of the best fitness centers with, again, incredible ceiling-to-floor windows overlooking the River Walk and a spacious yet enclosed balcony for outdoor yoga during the right season- If it's a beautifuld day outside and you don't want to exercise indoors, the River Walk is only steps awayCons- Because it is a central hotel, it is quite a long trek from Chicago O'Hare International Airport. Traffic adds to the meter and it seems like there's always traffic. Avg. taxi fare one way is $55+. If you can find alternate transportation, recommend you do.- Customer service was not as hospitable as other hotels of comparable chains. We sampled most services offered in the hotel from check-in, concierge, valet, bell hop, guest room, FedEx and more. The hotel greeters and concierge desk were the most hospitable - friendly and patient with questions. All other services were unfriendly/curt, sometimes impatient with questions. - The rooms are dated and of subpar quality; the view helped me overlook these I'm not a high-maintenance traveller so I'm open to overlooking the cons and appreciating the pros. However, I rate customer service very high on my list as an important experience and this hotel has some improvements to make in this area to help make guests feel welcomed.",nan,nan,ta_s1157
trip_advisor,"This is the first time I have visited Downtown Chicago. Sheraton is well located on the river with great views, easy walk to most tourist interested sights including the river boat tours. The open-top bus stop is literally at the door step. The staff especially at the reception is efficient and friendly. There are great variety of restaurant in-house ranging from coffee shop to a great steak house. The rooms are spacious and I had the best night sleep in a hotel there as the pillows and the Duvet are the best. I was told that you can buy them on their website. However, the beds are a little bit high for older folks. Would definitely return when I have a chance.",nan,nan,ta_s1158
trip_advisor,"This was a last minute trip to present at a seminar being held in the hotel, so I didn't do any research and just booked. I honestly haven't stayed in a Sheraton anywhere in a very long time. So I had no expectations going in and was pleasantly surprised to find it to be an older hotel with some personality that's been kept up very well. It was clean everywhere, room was comfortable and service at all touchpoints was very good. Internet speed in the room was around 1.9 Mbps up/down and I'd like to see that higher. Food quality in the banquet areas was well done, too. A nice touch in the ChiBar is that they serve a nice snack mix with your drinks, which made watching the world series game going on at the time all the more pleasant.",nan,nan,ta_s1159
trip_advisor,"Clean, spacious and quiet rooms is always a great experience. If staying here, see if they can give you Navy Pier view.Sheraton hotel is my ""go to"" hotel every time I visit Chicago for business. Within walking distance, you have a pharmacy, great sushi bar and other restaurants, movie theatre, bowling alley, liquor store and many other places, it is OK to say that is very well located. At other hotels, waiting for a taxi in the middle of winter could be a really cold and bad experience. However, this hotel has a heated entrance that keeps you nice and warm while you wait for your car.The bar area at the lobby is a great happy hour scene and perfect for chilling out after a hard day of work. And, although it could get really noisy, it does not affect noise levels in lower rooms.I definitely recommend staying here.",nan,nan,ta_s1160
trip_advisor,"As a frequent business traveler and Starwood loyalist, I've stayed in a lot of hotels and Sheratons specifically. This property is in a terrific location and is a solid choice for anyone visiting Chicago for work or business. It's bright, recently updated, and has a very nice space in the lobby for congregating. The bed was more comfortable than most and the gym is huge and very well appointed.",nan,nan,ta_s1161
trip_advisor,"The hotel is a 7 minute hike from the Midway airport to downtown subway stop. So for $3.50 transit you get a little exercise. It's a busy big city hotel and the staff are trained to be helpful. The service is not spectacular, but it is warm, helpful and friendly. Rooms are what you would expect in this price range and location. There are some super-nice views of the river so it is worth requesting. I had some issues at checkout which weren't the hotel's fault, but I did expect a little more than ""Sorry, no refund on your cancellation"" from the manager, especially as it was a convention and the room would be rented our regardless. Overall a nice enough place and convenient. If you are booking a convention. the tech services are excellent, but some of the other support services are lacking in odd and unaccountable ways. You have to be willing to be assertive to get stuff done right and as expected.",nan,nan,ta_s1162
trip_advisor,We stayed here for 3 nights in September and thoroughly enjoyed it. There was a little confusion over my reservation but that was only because we had been upgraded to a suite which looked odd in the booking system to the new employee on the front desk. The room was simple yet elegant. The maid service was awesome. A brief walk to get to many of the river boat companies along the river and the Magnificent Mile. I would definitely stay here the next time I am in the Windy City!,nan,nan,ta_s1163
trip_advisor,A decent Sheraton average room a little dated if you ask me they could use a some TLC I do think that the hotel gets a little overwhelmed at times it's a very large and it just seems like they lose track of what's going on from time to time the one thing I find a little odd is that sometimes when I try to book this hotel even with so many room I can't find a room or they want some astronomical amount of money they tell me the main reason for this is because they host a lot of conferences and they have a tendency to block off large sections meaning that the average traveler who just wants to go for a day or two can't always get a good room here at least this is been my personal experience,nan,nan,ta_s1164
trip_advisor,"Dad and I have a tradition staying at this hotel when we visit Chicago around the holiday season. Our experience this time was good with room for improvement:1) We got upgraded to a suite with our Suite Night award2) Our room was spacious, and the TV in the bed room was not working very well, very likely due to the fact that the hotel is doing renov at the time (cable wiring etc.)3) The club lounge is closed due to renov.4) Albeit the substitutes vouchers to the Club Lounges were great, the quality of the vouchers was inconsistent. And the vouchers were still not a complete substitute for the Club Lounge, where I find more of an escape from most hassels and noises5) We ran into one of our familiar front desk ladies. She is with blonde hair, and she is fantastic. We have seen her there about 8 years (some years in the club lounge and some years at the front desk). She is always great!Overall, a good stay. Very good staff.",nan,nan,ta_s1165
trip_advisor,"Coming to the Sheraton Hotel and Towers is like coming home. Everyone works very hard to make sure you have a good experience while you are staying at the hotel. From the moment I check-in until check-out the staff works very hard to assist you. I stay and the Sheraton several times a year and can honestly say, I have enjoyed each one. The location is also a plus, plenty of shopping, sightseeing and fine dining within walking distance! Great place to stay while in Chicago.",nan,nan,ta_s1166
trip_advisor,"Due to unforeseen circumstances, my three day business trip turned into a two week plus stay. The staff - from the concierge desk, housekeeping, and the Starwood Club, could not have been more accommodating to the special medical request and assistance we required.

Upon trying to check in, we found out there was no evidence I booked a room and the hotel was completely sold out.With a quick call to Hotels.com we figured out that they completely misspelled my name. Ahhh. foreign customer service.....Need I say more....Anyway, the check in was smooth. Excellent room with a river view. Near most of the activitieswe wanted to hit. Tour bus pick-up was just across the street. Hop on and hop off wherever you wanted.The bed was great. Will stay again when in town.",nan,nan,ta_s1168
trip_advisor,"The hotel is beautiful and we had great service checking in. However, for the price we paid I was disappointed at how poorly maintained their rooms and guest floors are. Carpets are stained in many different spots in the hallways, and our room didn't feel clean. Everything was very dusty. The bathroom had hair strands all over the floor, and the toilet rocked. Just not what you expect from a 4+ star hotel.",nan,nan,ta_s1169
trip_advisor,"We chose a last minute weekend getaway and this was the hotel with the availability and right price. It was right on the river and we walked Michigan Ave from here. The gps had a hard time finding the parking garage. Parking was $49 for 24 hours. The garage was clean and well lit. We stayed on the 10th floor so we had a great view. The room was fully stocked with snacks and drinks, but be prepared to pay. A can of Diet Coke was $5. the little fridge was so full there was no room to keep leftovers, which we did not like. Our room was clean and the bed was perfect. We were right off the elevator, so we could hear a little hall noise but it was pretty nice really. The have a little coffee shop and diner downstairs.Everyone was very polite and really friendly. They even served cheesecake and cupcakes in the lobby on Saturday night. We had a few drinks at the bar, a little pricey but there is a Walgreens about a block away if you want to mix your own drinks in your room. We would certainly stay here again.",nan,nan,ta_s1170
trip_advisor,"Checked in and went up to our room to change and head out to dinner. However, they had not cleaned the room prior to us getting there. Called the desk and the first thing they told me was that the hotel was fully booked (not we are sorry or anything else). They promised to call back and they didnt. We finally changed and left for dinner. Fortunately when we returned they had cleaned the room. Interestingly enough, we did not get an apology or any signal that they had screwed up.Great location but I think we will go elsewhere.",nan,nan,ta_s1171
trip_advisor,"Stayed at this hotel for 2 nights while on a business trip. There is nothing outstanding about this hotel in terms of what you would expect from a hotel, but I did have a few things that were bad.1. The room had almost no electric plugs. The plug build into the desk lamp did not work. There was one available under the desk and 2 in the bathroom. So plugging in a laptop, phone charger and iron was a challenge. One would think that in the digital age the hotel would make an effort to provide guests with accessible electrical outlets.2. The cover for the air conditioning unit rattled when the AC was on. It was loud enough to prevent me from falling asleep.3. The clock on the nightstand did not have a back-light, so figuring out time was a challenge even in daylight, and certainly at night.4. Bathroom contained long black hair on the floor, with the longest hair sitting on the water bowl of the toilet. I think it's gross having to stay in a room with human hair that is not yours. See attached photo.5. Bath/shower tiles where dirty, moldy, old and tired. See attached photo.The last problem is not really a reflection of the hotel. My first night I was awoken by a slamming door next to my room, followed by loud drunk people having a time of their lives. This activity kept me awake for 15 minutes before I called downstairs. They sent security up to ask the people to calm down. The noise subsided but I was now awake at 1:45am wishing I fall asleep fast so I could be ready for my early morning meetings.Let me also mention that I am in the travels business (IATAN member), and I would think twice before recommending this particular hotel to my clients.",nan,nan,ta_s1172
trip_advisor,"A terrible bed can mean a terrible stay, and a great bed makes a huge difference. I just loved the bed at the Sheraton - I was really tired my first night and just wanted to drop to sleep. The bed was super comfortable, the pillows were just right, and the high thread count sheets were awesome. They also did a great job making the bed, which I think can be made with the top sheet too tight for comfort! This was fantastic. Temperature control was perfect for sleeping as well, the bathroom mirror lighting was excellent for getting things ready. I was here for a conference and the catered meals were excellent as well. Nice job! Usually I'm a bit biased against large chain hotels in the downtown of a major city, since often they seem a bit shabby. Not at all the case here - I may need to reexamine my bias!",nan,nan,ta_s1173
trip_advisor,"Whenever I travel to Chicago, I always stay at the Sheraton on the River. What a fantastic staff! Every level of employee I came into contact with was exceptionally kind and helpful.

trip_advisor,"I loved the hotel! From the second we got there the staff was super helpful! Our room was nice and we even had a view of the water which was perfect. I do have to add that if you need any concierge assistance, you need to go see Marisa. She was SO helpful and so happy and nice. Every time we went over to here, she offered us many recommendations and tips and was so friendly-she definitely made a great impression on me for the hotel and I would go back for sure. Thanks so much Marisa, you were so great!! :) A tip regarding the rooms: ask if you can stay in a room with a nice view of the water because I don't think any other view will be as good. Have fun!",nan,nan,ta_s1175
trip_advisor,"I stayed 3 nights at this hotel and it was great. Loved the 'green option' where you get points or $10 credit if you decline daily maid service.

I give this hotel an A+",nan,nan,ta_s1176
trip_advisor,"After 7 hours on my Chicago walkabout and a delightful F.L.Wright tour I arrived feeling very much like a tired 74 yr female. At the check in desk I met Mr. Michael Jackson. His smile, helpful advice and extremely pleasant manner made me feel welcome and perhaps a little relaxed. I tell everyone I care more about a view from my room than anything else. I had such a wonderful view I did not leave the room until morning. It was a delight. On check out I again had Mr. Jackson. I strongly suggest the management of this Hotel increase Mr. Jackson's income and when he wants, move him to whatever position he desires. Without the view the room is much as I've stayed around the world. I found the bed, pillows, towels, etc to be very acceptable. The only thing I wonder is why this chain would need revenue so bad it must charge for a college dorm type refrig. I love and drink a lot of Cold Water. At other hotels I am able to keep my water bottles cold. I wonder how much is really gained because I just use more of the Hotel's ice, keeping my water cold in the ice bucket. It was a very pleasant stay.",nan,nan,ta_s1177

The staff was exceptionally accommodating and helpful, the facilities clean and well appointed, and for the first time in my life, I awoke with no back pain.

trip_advisor,"So, my friends and I stayed here for my bachelorette party. When we arrived, we parked in the parking garage and then followed a crazy labyrinth of hallways to get to the lobby area. Once we go to the lobby, it was extremely nice! The check-in process was easy, and the room was great. We had a fantastic view of the river and of Lake Michigan! The beds were quite comfortable and not complaints about the bathroom.My only complaint was that apparently my Maid of Honor (who put the hotel rooms on her card) was charged for a bottle of Gatorade from the mini bar which we know we did NOT open. She called and asked which room out of the two it came from, and they couldn't even tell her that. We know we didn't touch any of those items, but we couldn't really dispute it and we were charged anyway.All in all, it was in a great location - walking distance to restaurants and bars - and we had a great time!",nan,nan,ta_s1179
trip_advisor,"We had stayed before through a Priceline Name-Your-Price deal, but chose it this time. We absolutely LOVE the location - especially in the summer as it is directly on the river. The room was large, clean and quiet - even though it was the first room off the elevator and across from the stairwell. The bedding is absolutely amazing (down comforter and lots of down pillows) and we had a nice view of the river. We enjoyed sitting outside one night at one of the ""fire tables"" along the river and could see part of the fireworks from Navy Pier. On our last day we had lunch at Chicago Burger and sat outside at one of the tables on the river. We enjoyed walking along the river at night, this hotel has easy access to Michigan Avenue, Millenium Station and there is a bridge to the other side of the river right outside the hotel. We will be back!",nan,nan,ta_s1180
trip_advisor,"This was my second time visiting Chicago and this time I traveled alone and stayed for just one night. On my way from Mexico City to New York, I added in this stop because I am a huge baseball fan and have always wanted to see the Cubs play at famous Wrigley Field. The service at check-in was expedient, the concierge was helpful in guiding me towards the 'L' train to get to Wrigley, and the room I stayed in was very clean, beds were comfortable, and I had a great view of the river below. My only real negative point to make is on the price. When I visited Chicago for the first time in January of 2013, I was able to stay for 3 nights at the Conrad Hotel in the Hilton Portfolio- in my opinion at least 1.5 stars above this Sheraton- for only $25-30 extra per night. Overall, though, I was very pleased and will definitely consider booking at this Sheraton again on one of my future visits to the Windy City.",nan,nan,ta_s1181

Obviously, being in downtown this is a busy place, but my check in process was efficient and speedy. The room was nothing terribly special but fine. I had a nice view of the Chicago River and could see the lakefront as well. The amenities were good with plenty of soap and shampoo. The bed was comfortable and clean. The room was large enough we weren't crammed in though the bathroom was pretty small with only one sink. Don't you hate it when you're using the facilities and someone rams the door into your feet cause there's no room for it? *L*The hotel was quiet with not a lot of extraneous noise in the hall ways. Food was okay....breakfast was the best. Very few options for dinner with really only Shula's open at night. I didn't really want a big dinner so went wandering along the river and found a bar next door to the hotel. The meeting rooms were clean and functional.They made parking simple. I had driven to the hotel. It was easy to pick up the car once you followed the maze down to get it. I'd stay there again though have stayed in much nicer hotels in Chicago. It's priced reasonably for a convention hotel.",nan,nan,ta_s1183
trip_advisor,"I am an SPG member. I am a National officer for the APWU and attended our National convention from July 16-26. I had to switch my room a total of four times.I was promised to have my bags moved from room to room and each time I was disappointed, they were not. I basically had to live out of a suitcase . Now I know why I usually dont stay at SPG hotels. I gave them another shot and the result was total failure. I consider myself an easy going person but felt compelled to write this. The hotel knows how to take reservations but not hold them. This never should have happened with such an advance booking. Beware!",nan,nan,ta_s1184
trip_advisor,"While the room we stayed in was in need of renovation (which we were told is being done), the staff and location made up for all other flaws. From the front desk clerk at check-in, to the guest room attendants, to the waiter in Shula's Restaurant who showed great concern because I wasn't feeling great, we had an exceptional experience. These were the friendliest people in any hotel I have ever stayed. I firmly belief attitude is created at the top. If you treat your employees nicely, they tend to be nice to customers. Congrats on a great staff! As for the location, terrific! We walked everywhere easily.",nan,nan,ta_s1185
trip_advisor,"I spend two nights at this hotel for a reunion in June. Everything about my stay was nice and smooth. The beds were comfortable, the rooms were clean, and the front desk was helpful. When I was checking in, the price of my room actually went down, and front desk gave me the lower price, which I was very appreciative about. However, the hotel is a short walk from the famous Michigan Ave shopping, so was convenient in that sense.I did NOT use any of the hotels facilities (gym, restaurant, etc.) so cannot comment on that. It is a large hotel, so does not have that warm and cozy feeling of boutique or independent hotels, but they did everything right. It is what you would expect of a Sheraton. I would recommend this hotel to others.",nan,nan,ta_s1186
trip_advisor,"One of the most beautiful hotels I've ever stayed at. Everything was pristine, the staff was beyond courteous and helpful, and the location is great. The shower was better than most hotel showers, too. Fitness center was nice and the bed was comfortable. It takes a few minutes to get to the el, so if it's wintertime I imagine that's not very pleasant, but other than that everything was perfect. There is a great espresso bar right across the street--nice perk!",nan,nan,ta_s1187
trip_advisor,"I want to share my TERRIBLE experience in the Sheraton Hotel in Chicago this past Friday the 25th of July.I went with my family to go around Chicago sites and when we went back from Dinner & party around 2:30am i went into my room #2235. I was walking from the elevator to my room and 2 Afroamerican females came from other room in front of me and start dancing very close with me and (3 sec) and one of them took my wallet with credit cards and 800 usd in cash.I figured out when i came to my room that i did not have my wallet and i ran very fast to the lobby and the 2 females went in a taxi i was not able to recover my wallet. I felt very very frustrated with the situation. I call the police and file the report #HX359387Next day i talked with the sheraton Manager and the security responsible and explain the situation and my concern.Honestly i was expecting to recover to me the 800 usd but of course they just say ""i am sorry""My phone number if someone want to know more details is 2692773697This trip was with my family, my Mother, my 2 kids and my sister and her complete family, in total 8 persons in 2 rooms.Juan Carlos Fernandez",nan,nan,ta_s1188
trip_advisor,"We had a corner room with two wide windows, with expansive views of Chicago's skyline. The bed was incredibly comfortable, great nights' sleep both nights. Nice fitness center and indoor pool, with terrific restaurant, Chicago Burger Company, on the premises. Also, the VIP room with yummy fruit, bakery goods and selection of juices for a nice Continental breakfast was a nice treat. Concierge was very helpful with night life tips and directions for other amenities nearby. Transportation is never a problem, with cabs lined up right outside the front door. Al in all, a great experience!",nan,nan,ta_s1189
trip_advisor,"Sometimes you don't really understand a hotel's service mentality until there is serious problem to be solved. A couple of days ago, we were staying at the Sheraton when we came back after a long day of sightseeing to find that they we doing some maintenance work on the hotel elevators that involved some pretty strong smelling paint or stain. For most people, this would have been a minor inconvenience as they passed through the hallway and went on to their rooms.For my wife and daughter however, it was a huge issue. Both suffer from severe migraines brought on by smells, among other things. From the moment we set foot back in the hotel, they were sick and getting sicker. The smell was in the halls and the room. For most people, including me, the smell quickly faded into the background and stopped being noticeable. However, they were in bad shape.Over the course of about two hours, the hotel front desk and the manager on duty, Caitlin Gooding, went out of their way to help us. They offered us different rooms throughout the hotel to try and get us away from the smell. The bell staff moved us a couple of times. They even offered a suite on the top floor, thinking this would solve the problem. And throughout the process, they were patient, helpful and understanding. In the end, they couldn't find a room for us where my family couldn't smell the paint, so Caitlin arranged a room for us at a nearby Westin. I was so appreciative of her patience and the personal interest she took, especially because the smell was not obvious to someone who doesn't have the sensitivity (including me). Yet, she persevered to a solution. We think that she and the staff at the Sheraton were great!",nan,nan,ta_s1190
trip_advisor,"We stayed here for a family trip to Chicago. I got the room half price through hotwire. Parking is $49 a night for self park or $58 for valet. The only difference in the location of each is self park is the floor beneath, but there is an elevator. Upon check in, you will be asked for a credit card that automatically will charge you $100 for incidentals. When you check out, that money is supposed to be credited back to you, or whatever you didn't spend. In the room there is a stocked fridge but a coke is $5. You can't put your own things in the fridge, you have to get another fridge brought to you. Also there are snacks in the room, but $7 for the M&ms? The snacks are in plain site with sensors under them. If you have young children, this might be a problem. Phone calls from the room cost money. Gym and pool is nice. Just a cpl blocks from Michigan ave. Right on the riverwalk. Lots of restaurants around and shopping. Overall, nice hotel, but it seems they try to nickel and dime you to death if you aren't careful.",nan,nan,ta_s1191
trip_advisor,"Great full service Sheraton with an exceptional location right on the riverfront in Chicago. The meeting space is immense and allows for large sized meetings. Shula's restaurant is a good dining option, but there are fabulous restaurants all around for additional options.The rooms are well done, recently renovated, and very comfortable. The bedding is luxurious and the AC units in each room work well - overcoming even the worst heat and humidity that Chicago has to offer.",nan,nan,ta_s1192
trip_advisor,"What a beautiful place, my mouth dropped open right from the door! I stayed there one night for my 5 years anniversary and let me tell you i was so happy that i had booked there! The hotel is very clean and big! I loved that they have like 3 or 4 places to eat at the hotel and as well the river walk on the south of the hotel was very clean and beautiful! I would like to give a special thanks to Megan in housekeeping for making our stay at sheraton a memory to not ever forget! I as well want to thank ""NIA "" at the check in she was very helpful and very welcoming , to the point where she had called us in our room to see how my stay was going and if there was anything that we needed just let her know! That is a truly great service ! Great job ""Nia""! Even though my wife and i live in chicago very often we love staying in downtown, i got to say after this stay here, Sheraton has become my favorite hotel!",nan,nan,ta_s1193
trip_advisor,"Just had our first experience at this hotel. What a great experience. Parking however is a bit costly and sometimes the hotel does not allow for self parking. The first room was a lake view, however, caution not all rooms are actually what they say they are. The front desk agent, Mia, said we had the lake view which was what we signed on for. However she did not mention that there may be construction in our way. Needless to say, it was not much of a lake view. We called down and instead opted for a nicer view, one that we had paid for and made the trip for. She changed our room to a very nice view of the Chicago River. We were very happy with this change and plan to make a yearly visit out of it! We loved loved loved that room! Wish the prices for the mini-bar, snacks, and internet was free like many other hotels in the area offer. Maybe they should opt in to giving guest free snacks, such as a cookie like the DoubleTree.",nan,nan,ta_s1194
trip_advisor,"WE have to stay here every year and I dread it. The rooms need to be set on fire and gutted. Everything is old old old and worn out. I recognize stains from 10 years ago. Lobby is nice.

Everything was great -- service, room, restaurants, location, etc. I arrived early but they got me in a great room. Every hotel employee I interacted with was courteous and professional. Room was clean, neat, sizable, and quiet. Only thing I didn't like was the minibar and snacks available are movement activated, which could be a nightmare if you have small children. I just didn't touch it. The location is superb, within walking distance of so many things to do. One weekend definitely not enough!",nan,nan,ta_s1196
trip_advisor,"I stayed at this hotel for the 4th of July. I chose this hotel because it was dog friendly. Everyone was very nice to my little dogs. They were soooo busy on the 4th of July, but they accommodated us as best they could. I reserved connecting rooms and when I got there it was not ready. They gave us a voucher so we can eat at the restaurant while we waited and as an apology for having to wait. Well we waited for 2 hours and they told us they couldn't give us a connecting room which we had reserved. When they gave us our room it was just not feasible for 5 people and 2 dogs so they took us out of the room and ended up giving us the connecting room we originally requested. It was frustrating but at the same time I know they were really busy. We were able to cross the street and watch the fireworks at night on Columbus Ave. on top of the bridge. The next day we went to the River Walk which is below the hotel and did some kayaking and rode on the water taxi. I recommend this hotel and I would stay here again. They have good staff and a great location. There is an indoor pool which is great for the kids. The beach is near by to, just a quick taxi ride away as well as Navy Pier.",nan,nan,ta_s1197
trip_advisor,"Stayed at the Sheraton Hotel Downtown from July 13th thru the 19th for the purpose of a convention. So the room was paid for at a discount rate of $250 per night, taxes included.The Hotel: The Hotel is 32 stories high serviced by 2 separate banks of 6 elevators broken down as to where you are going. To the left is the elevators for Lobby thru 16th floor, the elevators to the right are for floors 17 thru the top. Never had to wait too long to wait for elevator at any time of day, and I didn't see staff using the elevators.The hotel has a Dob Shulas steak restaurant, a Burger Bar, and a Bisto type restaurant. The hotel also has large meeting spaces. The hotel pool and spa center is up in the 7th floor, and it was a decent sized pool, and a gym that seem well equipped. The spa also had a sauna. The hotel is within walking distance to many restaurants, and the famous Navy Pier.Check In: Check in was a breeze, I got the high floor I wanted, and I was on my way in no time. Please beware, this hotel puts what I consider a large incidental deposit, $250, on the credit card that is used, so that money is unavailable. Most hotels I use only do $100. The staff explained to me that the deposit amount is dependent on length of stay.The Room: I had a king size bedroom, and the room itself was plenty big. In addition to the king berm there was a small desk, a dresser with a 42"" TV, the dresser also included the wet bar refrigerator. The great thing is, you can say what your room deposit is used for, so that if you don't want to use the wet bar, you can say so, and they wet bar fridge will lock itself. I though that was neat. I had my fridge locked when I saw the prices they wanted. The room also had a ottoman chair, and windows had blackout drapes. The view is toads the Trump Tower from the room. The room also comes with a closet that had plenty of hangers, a ironing board w/iron, and a built in wall safe that is NOT big enough for a laptop, but plenty rom for a tablet device..The Bathroom: The bathroom was of good size, with a good vanity space area, which is where you also get your free daily 8oz bottle of water. The bat tub was plenty spacey and I found that their was plenty of hot water at good pressure. There was towel setup with 3 of everything, bath towels, was cloths, and hand towels.Misc: The hotel does have a taxi stand manned by bellhops. When you need a cab, just get in line and tell bellhop where you want to go, the bellhop blows his whistle, and a cab shows up. If you need more luxurious ride, they can do that too.I ate at the Burger Bar down by the water, and a Bacon Cheeseburger, Friea and Root beer cost me $23, which I think is outrageous. The same can be said to the room service menu. $28 for a cheese omelet, you have to be kidding me. The prices in general at the restaurants and room service menu, were, in mu opinion, way off the chart for what they should be. I know hotel is in the corporate section of Chicago, but $28 for a omelet. They are crazy. Luckily they are plenty of restaurants in area with reasonable prices. The telephones are another expansive item, if you were to use it. And they charge for use of their wifi, which is another, outrageous cost, which I think was around $10/day.The hotel is also within walking distance to the Navy Pier, where you can eat, play, or take a dinner cruise.Bottom Line: I loved this hotel, very comfortable, and the service was unmatched. I just hated that they had the balls to charge as much as they diid for ancillary services, and their food prices.


Green Features: The hotel has a program where if you go without room service for a certain amount of days, you get a $10 credit. Also, they do the whole, if the towel is not on the floor, they don't replace it",nan,nan,ta_s1198
trip_advisor,"Stayed over a Saturday. According to the desk clerk, the hotel was full because the Chicago marathon was being ran that weekend. The lobby that looks out onto the river was never crowded. Neither was the hotel pool. The workout equipment was state of the art and all was clean and clean towels were available. Lockers were available in the locker room.",nan,nan,ta_s1199

Location is absolutely wonderful, just minutes walk to Navy Pier, Michigan Street and my personal favorite - Water Taxi Stop. Breathtaking view from the tower. The interior is luxurious yet guest friendly, well maintained and managed. Love the staff - highly professional and genuinely caring - asked for mini fridge, roll-away bed, additional towels, all delivered within 5-10 minutes. Front desk is polite and efficient, and the staff at the Club Lounge is amazing - funny and friendly, feels like family, good view and nice food (it was jam packed during the two days of my stay but they pulled it off making you feel no pressure at all).Parking is a little expensive but hey it's downtown Chicago so what can you do...

Lots of photo ops and great location to host family who have never been to the windy city before. Just steps away from Millenium Park, Nike World, and Macy's - something for everyone.Perfect location for the boat tours - we got on the first tour of the day on Saturday for the tour that includes river and lake. PLUS, The Sheraton is one of the buildings highlighted on that tour.Our delightful concierge, Paula, helped us get boat tickets and dinner reservations. Very helpful since we were only there for a short weekend.Rooms were nice, we have views of the Navy Pier Fireworks from our room, and the bar was fun, spacious, and a great place to watch soccer.Everything went smoothly - we'll be back!",nan,nan,ta_s1201

trip_advisor,"The hotel was nicely located in Downtown Chicago and also close to Navy Pier. There was plent of shopping, places to eat, and entertainment nearby. The staff was friendly and helpful. We upgraded our room to a king with a city view. It was well worth the upgrade for the bed and the view. The Keurig in the room was a very nice touch. The only complaint I have is that we found hair in our bed both nights we stayed. I had hoped that a hotel of this caliber would have paid attention to that small detail.",nan,nan,ta_s1203
trip_advisor,"It can be tough to find a decent hotel in downtown Chicago that is relatively close to everything, is moderately priced and is pleasant and clean...Swissotel is one of those few.The staff is friendly and attentive, and you experience a cool, hip vibe the moment you walk in. (Speaking of walking, you are close enough to walk to Chicago's premier shopping area, ""the Miracle Mile"".)The design is a bit contemporary, clean and fun.Good drinks at their bar, good food at their cafe and they always seem to have a few rooms left, again, for a fair price, when everyone else seems to be sold out.Many go for the major chains and names, but do yourself a favor next time and give Swissotel a try; you won't be disappointed!",nan,nan,ta_s1204
trip_advisor,"One standard river view room included city, river, lake, and Navy Pier view. The hotel sits at an angle to make this happen. I stayed at the W Lakeshore the week prior to my stay at the Swissotel. Both had imbecile rooms, service, and views...but the Swissotel will be my first choice next time around because of its location (quick walk to the Art Institute of Chicago and Millennium Park) and mix of city and water view.",nan,nan,ta_s1205
trip_advisor,Stayed there for a couple of nights while on a business trip. The location of the hotel is nice (the only nice thing with the view) if you want to do some shopping or visit the city. The lobby is OK. Things get horrible when you get to the room. First the door room does not close really well. I thought this was a problem with the initial room I was given. However I asked to be relocated and had the same problem with the second room. The furniture in the room is horrible and the bathroom is not nice. Breakfast is takne in the basement.

I was there for sightseeing so was out all day & only in the hotel to sleep. beds are super comfy, staff very friendly & concierge very helpful. The elevators at first were a little confusing that you have to press the first number of your room & it will tell you by alphanumeric letters which elevator to catch makes your trip up/down much quicker. Great views of Navy Pier. I liked the coffee machine in the room, but a biscuit on the side would've been a nice touch. I also loved the infused water with fruit in the lobby a nice touch. Keep up the friendly positive vibe Swissotel",nan,nan,ta_s1208
trip_advisor,First time staying here - in town for a conference. Rooms were nice - great view - seemed very efficient. My only complaint would be when we checked in there was some issues with how the room was booked and the person checking us in felt like he had to educate all of us on how problematic this was and that next time we should do better. That doesn't always sit well with a bunch of college professors and administrators.... but I did like the room and my preference would be to come back here again next year!,nan,nan,ta_s1209
trip_advisor,"Overall a very nice hotel property, tastefully decorated with up-to-date guest rooms. Beautiful views of the Navy Pier with easy access to Michigan Ave shopping and the highway. The pool on the 42nd floor was nice and warm and our kids really enjoyed that. The staff we interacted with were very responsive and pleasant to deal with. Downside: The only negative thing about staying here was the price of parking. $65 per day to park is ridiculous. I could see maybe $35 a day, but to spend $130 for 2 days parking seems insane to me. That's almost as much as lodging for a night.",nan,nan,ta_s1210
trip_advisor,The Swiss is a great hotel in downtown Chicago. We really enjoyed the whole experience of staying there except the dining options in the hotel. Most of Chicago's great hotels have great restaurants on site which the Swiss didn't.  The location is great for shopping or visiting Millenium Park. You are in the middle of it all.  I could not give it 5 stars because of the dining options but I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone.,nan,nan,ta_s1211
trip_advisor,"I would recommend this hotel. Rooms were nice. They are a little dated, but are in no way in shambles. The beds are very comfortable, the views are great, and the bathroom is above average. Be prepared, as everything in this area of the city, really the city in general, is expensive. That being said, you can get to the museums, shopping, restaurants, etc., all very easily with a $10 or less cab. I would of given this a 5 star review if it wasn't for the pool area that left something to be desired. (I visited with kids) You wont be disappointed and the really negative reviews are off base.",nan,nan,ta_s1212

My review of the Chicago hotel will be ongoing during my current stay. Checked in late last night and everything went smoothly. My room was ready and clean. It's got a fantastic view of the Navy Pier. I did ask for strawberries and champagne for my arrival, but I found champagne and an anniversary cupcake when I arrived. It wished me all the best on my non-existent anniversary. No big deal though seeing as the cupcake was delicious. The bathroom is what I would expect for a hotel of this class. The walls are a little thin though and I can hear my neighbors so that is something to keep in mind. I'm here for five days so I will update later. Paul W.",nan,nan,ta_s1213
trip_advisor,"I will start with the positives: The beds are very comfortableThe view from the corner king rooms is great The room, lobby, etc are very hip and well decoratedThe bath products were decent I would put the general feel and look of the hotel on par with other 4 star hotelsThe location was pretty good (about a 5-10 min walk from the Magnificent Mile) Now the negatives:Our room did not have heat and it was well below freezing outside. We complained twice and was not offered a new room for over 6 hours after checking in. It was literally 48 degrees in our room when we were finally given a new room. It was Valentine's Day and the hotel was near capacity, so we were given the exact same room, despite being forced to switch rooms at 10:30 pm (it was a higher floor). Given that it was a special night, we did not make a big deal of it with management, although he did offer to adjust the rate to $199 (the original price was $279). The next morning, upon checkout, we were told that the best they could do was a 25% discount for us (that does not add up to the price agreed upon the night before). At this point, the counter staff acted as if she was doing us a favor by giving us a room with heat and said there was nothing more they would do for us. What is most upsetting about this situation is not that the room didn't have heat, as we understand that things happen. It was that the hotel did not make an effort to right this wrong, and the general service and attitude was very poor. Other negatives:Dust bunnies in the air ventTowel had large (12 inch in diameter) hole in itNo free internet (typical, but still annoying) Champagne offered in the date night package is actually two glasses of Prosecco at the barTook more than two calls to get us removed from a 48 degree roomThe hotel needs to work on their service and general attitude towards their customers.",nan,nan,ta_s1214
trip_advisor,"I've stayed at the Swissotel countless times. It's a welcoming place with contemporary-style rooms that offer beautiful to spectacular views of Lake Michigan and the North River. The views of the lake used to be even more expansive until they built the Raddison Blue Hotel nearby but that's life in major urban area. The rooms are exceptionally spacious and airy and the bedding is sumptuous. There is a great workspace and a sitting area and plenty of outlets for devices. Coffee makers are included in each room and we often get breakfast included. I first began staying there with with my husband because we have family and friends in the city and the Swissotel offered a government employee rate we couldn't beat. We've subsequently become Swissotel members and get fantastic upgrades when we stay depending on the time of year. We almost always get moved to a large corner room with excellent views of the city but we've also been given suites for the price of a king room which are luxuriously spacious and sumptuous. The staff is wonderfully responsive and the hotel is located just off Michigan Ave but also tucked away from noise. If it's shopping you want, you can pop down to Nordstrom or the other high end shops along Michigan Ave. in minutes and if you want a serene walk on the banks of Lake Michigan, you're there in less than than ten minutes with a lovely walk down the North River until you get there. Restaurants abound in this area and you can have your pick of places within a short jaunt of the hotel. We like to eat at the bar if we want something on the lighter side. The hotel has its own restaurant but you can find most of the main dishes at the very open bar without a wait and the wine list is extensive. Service is tops. Then back up to your room for steamy shower or a soak before you turn in for the night. The bathrooms are solid--they have tubs and showers--nice to have a choice. Parking on site is available and the staff make every effort to bring your car to the front quickly but it's very pricey. If you don't need constant access to your car, there are garages a block or so down that offer parking for half the price. There's a new Whole Foods that's being completed a hop, skip and jump away if you feel like buying sandwiches etc for your dinner or lunch and the Art Institute is a beautiful walk from the hotel in the warm weather. My husband and I took advantage of a deal the Fairmont (which is down the street) was offering about a month ago since it's supposed to be a more upscale hotel and we stayed there overnight. Compared to the Swissotel, the rooms were tiny and not well appointed. The bed was too soft and the views were non-existent. We won't make that mistake again. And we'll continue staying at the Swissotel the next time we visit Chicago.",nan,nan,ta_s1215
trip_advisor,"Nice hotel for the price you pay. This seems to be more of a business hotel you're charged for everything. Wifi, wine glasses, you name it there's a charge. I visited this hotel for my first trip ever to Chicago on my birthday. I was sort of expecting something thoughtful or made up by the staff since they knew of the occasion but I was sadly mistaken. The hotel is nice, staff is nice and so are the rooms. I will probably come back here just not for memorable moments because unfortunately they don't believe in those.",nan,nan,ta_s1216
trip_advisor,"I ended up staying here when a quick Chicago trip turned into an over night with the snow. Ahhhh, Chicago in February. I found a great last minute deal and figured I'd stay here this time.My check in was delayed. I had to wait about 20 minutes for my company's off-price reservation to go into their system. The people at the front desk weren't overly sympathetic. I suppose I understand why front desk staff don't like dealing with off-price customers, but if it is that much of a bother, they shouldn't work with these deal site.When my reservation finally did get into their system, they offered me my choice of a high or low floor. I was able to get the high floor room I requested, even with bit of a view. The room was very comfortable and large.For me, the only weakness of this hotel is that there is not much life in the area immediately around the hotel. If you're looking for a lively street scene with different options, I would look someplace else. If a big room with a view is most important to you - this is the place. I just hope you get the same kind of great deal that I did. Happy travels!",nan,nan,ta_s1217

Sharange was especially nice, she brought up menu of local pizza places we acquired about. Top Notch Service. I had a corner room with City view and navy pier. I fell in love with the view, I left curtains open all night just to see the beautiful buildings in lights. Room is very clean. Only thing which was small is the TV channels, I missed a few of my favorite shows but it's okay. We stayed for 4 nights. I could stay there forever. Next time I visit Chicago, here I come Swisshotel.",nan,nan,ta_s1218
trip_advisor,"Decent hotel. However, I did pay extra for a ""city view"" and I was on the 6th floor (technically city view but not worth the extra money). I checked in and they asked me if I wanted to pay $50 for an upgrade to a higher floor. No. Then I had a requested 2 beds and he said that I wouldn't get a view. I opted for the king bed on the 6th floor. Then I find out the couple we were with were offered a FREE upgrade to a high floor with late check-out. Then we get to our 6th floor room and after a while realize the floor is all wet. Now they have to move us to the 38th floor with 2 beds. I thought I wouldn't get a view with a room with 2 beds? So after all that, I ended up with the room I should have gotten in the first place. Nice room but shower is way too small. Shower pressure was awful too. However, I'm noticing that alot of hotels are doing this these days. Would I stay again? Maybe if it was the best rate I could get, but otherwise no.",nan,nan,ta_s1219
trip_advisor,"I stayed here with my husband for a mini getaway. I have stayed here before because of the excellent service and overall accommodations. This time I hit a snag that really dampered my impression. I wanted to surprise my husband with a bottle of champagne and treats in our room when we arrived. I called the Concierge and she emailed me a form to fill out. It only showed credit card information and no place to indicate what I wanted to order. So I emailed back and another Concierge employee responded and said he was sending the correct forms. Well, the forms were basically identical, only asking for credit card information. There was one slight difference - at the top of one form it said ""Price Per Person."" This was ambiguous and did not help me in filling out the information about what I wanted in the room. So I emailed back and said this still doesn't help me, there's no place to indicate what I want, it's just asking for payment. Nevermind. I never heard back.I wasn't baiting them---but I was frustrated and wanted them to know. I shouldn't have to ask a third time, especially from a hotel with such a good reputation. A good hotel should reach out and offer help. So while we were staying there, I went up to one of the gentlemen behind the check-in counter to inquire about it. As I'm describing what happened he says, ""Oh yeah....you're the one who said nevermind, right?"" What???? He wasn't rude - but the way he said it was like, ""Yeah, I heard about you."" How did he know? Were people talking about it? Completely unprofessional. Not only did he act like he could have cared less, but when he pulled the forms up on his computer, told me they were different. I said, show me where. He noted the ""price per person"" line and then told me that's where I should have written what I wanted. I told him that makes no sense. He basically said ""sorry"" but without much interest and barely made eye contact with me the entire conversation. The room was fine, housekeeping was good, restaurant and bar service very good. If not for the special request mess, I'd come back. But I won't -- there are too many other good options in the city.",nan,nan,ta_s1220
trip_advisor,"Once again the Swissotel delivers a relaxing weekend getaway. I was in a luxurious suite (with two bathrooms) for my stay. The bathroom had a huge soaker tub and two robes. The king size bed was very comfortable and had nice full pillows. I went to Geneva Restaurant for the breakfast buffet. It was a bit pricey but had a lot of options to choose from. Everything was fresh and tasty. I also ordered in room dining around 10pm from Geneva Restaurant. I ordered the filet MR and it came with a double stuffed potato, mushrooms, and a demi glaze sauce. It was delicious and the gentleman who delivered the meal was very professional. I really enjoyed my stay and that's why I always return. I love the luxurious rooms and the staff is exceptional. I worked with Angela at the concierge desk and a few others during my stay; everyone made me feel very comfortable and helped me with anything I needed. This hotel is in a great location in downtown Chicago. There is a ton of shopping and architecture to keep you busy during your stay. The blue line to O'Hare and the orange line to Midway are close by for easy transportation in and out of the city. The Swissotel is a great choice!",nan,nan,ta_s1221
trip_advisor,"I stayed here with my two toddlers and my husband over the 4th of July weekend last year. It was awesome, this is one of the BEST spots to go and stay if you want to walk out the front lobby and get a great show of the fireworks over the city. this is by the river walk so that makes it even more fun. we strolled all night by the water. the hotel was clean and comfortable and the staff was helpful and kind. the beds were co comfy as well :) we had a lovely view of the river out our room window. the parking is expensive. we paid 65 bucks a night for that. that was the only downside",nan,nan,ta_s1222
trip_advisor,"My husband and I stayed here on a 24 hour trip from the 'burbs. The hotel is in a good location, although ironically most of what we did was near Wabash and Hubbard. Still, not too far of a walk. The hotel was really empty! Not at all near capacity so we got a nice king corner room package. The $230 package included 2 buffet tickets at the hotel restaurant, and tickets to the Field Museum. The bed was really comfy, the room large, the view awesome, the package a good price. Here's the weird stuff: - since there are not many people at the hotel they make the buffet food as you order it, it was really confusing! But we did get comp'd the $74 (!!) for brunch. There were only about 3 other people in the restaurant (on a Saturday) too. - when we picked up our tickets for the museum we were given a total of two tickets. Turns out there should have been main entrance tickets and multiple special exhibit tickets. We had no idea until the ticket takers asked us where our other tickets were. It was all good - the tickets said Swissotel on them so they let us in. Worth the stay, just a few odd things.",nan,nan,ta_s1223
trip_advisor,"Started out fabulous! Room was upgraded from a king suite to the Presidential suite on the 41st floor overlooking Navy Pier (perfect for viewing fireworks)! Kudos to Raquel the front desk rep who was absolutely fabulous! Things started to go downhill when Barney Fifer continued to harass us stating multiple noise complaints! We only had 6 people in our suite watching fireworks! If you wanted to get some rest on New Years Eve with a Two year old why check in to a Downtown Chicago hotel on New Year's Eve....or why would the Swissotel place a family who wants to sleep next to the Presidential Suite! We we're told not to use the Bose system that's in the suite! Why put a system like that if guests can't use it! Just stupid! Overall the stag would have been better if the Swissotel would have planned properly and not placed a family who wants to sleep next to the Presidential suite on New Years Eve, that would have eliminated Barney Fifer and his crew from harassing me and my guests! We we're only watching fireworks, listening to House Music and mingling with 5 other guests on New Years Eve but it was ruined thanks Swissotel! Stella did give me a $60 credit! But the evening was still ruined",nan,nan,ta_s1224
trip_advisor,We have stayed at the Swissotel in Chicago many times and always enjoy it. It is a beautiful hotel with a beautiful location. It is located on the Chicago River with some rooms that have a wonderful view of Lake Michigan and Navy Pier. The Palm restaurant has delicious food and the breakfast buffet has a seemingly unlimited amount of choices. The rooms are very clean and well laid out and the staff has always been very friendly and accommodating.,nan,nan,ta_s1225
trip_advisor,"I book to Swissotel Chicago for the New Year 2015 for my family and my friend's family. We booked over the internet and called over the phone to make sure we get what we want. We booked it Thanksgiving Day. We posed extra for the above 12 floor. The Lakeview comes with the room price. We called and ask if we can have adjacent rooms as we have kids. Because of the layout of the hotel, we can only have one room with 2 beds and the other has yo be one king bed to have the room adjacent. So we took it even if we need 2 beds for both rooms. 3 days before the date of reservation, I called to confirm. The morning of check-in I called to confirm. When we checked in, my friend is in the 29th floor and me on the 30th floor. Room 2903 and 3002. I talked to the manager, she said sorry we are booked. They offer to move us 29th floor not Lakeview with 2 beds or a roller bed in the same room( there is barely room for the roller bed) She said that they have to accommodate people's requests. Looks like my Asian last name does not qualify to the people she is referring to. And oh, we only can even see half of the fire works. So, this is not a hotel for that purpose. The pool close at 6 pm. So the kids had to wake up early to swim. WiFi, you have to pay. Parking, even if it says free parking available, it actually cost $65.00/ night. And there is not really much extraordinary about the hotel. Do not be deceived with the pictures they post. The bubbles hanging is the only thing nice to look at. And when somebody next room uses the hair dryer, you can hear it in your room. A good alarm clock if that's what you need.",nan,nan,ta_s1226
trip_advisor,"A resident of one of Chicago's western suburbs, my wife and I make it a point to visit the city several times during the year. These visits typically include an overnight or weekend stay. Over the years, we have had the pleasure of stay at several of the city's nicer hotels. We discovered the Swissotel Chicago a few years ago and it quickly became out go-to hotel for our city visits.The hotel's location is perfect for us...centrally located and within walking distance to our favorite areas of the city, Millennium Park, Michigan Avenue, and Navy Pier. We love the overall decor and feel of the hotel and the rooms are large and very comfortable. We have also always found the staff extremely friendly and helpful. I have also found it difficult to beat the room rates.A word of caution for those driving to the hotel. Do not rely solely on GPS. Based on my experience, GPS will direct you to use Lower Wacker Drive. Taking this route, at some point you will lose your connection. Unless you are prepared or are familiar with the Drive, you run the risk of missing the correct exit. You may want to try one of the other easy alternative routes which avoid the Lower Wacker. Also, don't have parking sticker shock. On our last visit, it cost $62 to valet. This is comparable to other city hotel parking, though...and about equal cost of a couple train tickets and cab rides to and from the train station.",nan,nan,ta_s1227
trip_advisor,"Swissotel is a wonderful addition to your travels. The staff is professional, the rooms are comfortable and accomodating to your needs. The Chicago location is in an area with great views of the city but in a quiet location so you get a nice, restful sleep. The only drawback on our stay was the very strong smell of smoke of our floor when we returned to our room. Whomever was smoking (rudely so) on our floor inconvenienced other paying guests who were promised a smoke-free environment.We felt it was too late to call the front desk(after 1:30 AM) but we were not happy with the odor.Otherwise it was a very pleasant experience. The breakfast selections at the Geneva Restaurant are phenomenal. (Also, it would be nice to get our car out in front instead of heading down to the garage, if possible).",nan,nan,ta_s1228
trip_advisor,"We stayed at the Swissotel Chicago for 4 nights beginning on Christmas Eve afternoon. The building is beautiful, the gym and pool are above par, and housekeeping and operator (front desk help) were very good. Because I read reviews on this site, I joined their rewards program and had WiFi free of charge. Front desk was efficient, but not overly friendly. My biggest complaint was lack of amenities in room. I don't know if it's considered ""low brow"" or too American to provide coffee makers in the room, but even in budget hotels, this is provided. If Swissotel does not believe in coffee makers for guests, a general complementary coffee bar would be greatly appreciated. For off-site dining and coffee check out Eggys and Marianos, both right behind Swissotel. Not super close, but probably a 5 minute walk, and budget friendly.",nan,nan,ta_s1229
trip_advisor,"Took my two boys (young teens) to Chicago for the day - this hotel was perfect for us. Easy walking to Michigan Ave and the shops, easy driving to Shedd Aquarium. Doormen were super helpful, as was the valet. Parking was pricey (as everywhere in Chi), but there was 24 hr valet service, and you only needed 15 min notice to get your car. Elevators were great in that you put your floor number in BEFORE entering the elevator car - made things super fast. Fitness center and pool/sauna - LOVED. Beautiful views from the Fitness center that made the treadmill easier to be on! Rooms were super clean - loved the nightlight feature of the bathroom fixtures. Beds were only doubles (not queen-sized) which is getting to be more of a negative the older the kids get. Our room overlooked the river and Michigan avenue. Fabulous!!! Hotel was updated throughout. Loved the fruit-flavored water in the lobby. Good time to visit, too, since it was pretty quiet throughout (not a creature was stirring....).",nan,nan,ta_s1230
trip_advisor,"We booked five rooms for my family to attend a wedding being held at the Swissotel. My sister also booked three rooms to attend the same wedding with her family. The hotel is beautiful with breathtaking views of Navy Pier. My family and my sister's family were all speding money to travel to the wedding so we wanted to incur the expense of the hotel rooms as a gift for them. I expressed that desire when I booked the hotel rooms by telephone. I asked them if I needed to book the rooms all in my name as I was paying for them and they assured me that would not be necessary nor encouraged. My brother-in-law also had a lengthy conversation with the hotel personnel when he booked the rooms for his family and was also paying for a room for my nephew and his wife to stay (as an anniversary gift for them) the night before the wedding. My brother-in-law and I booked each room with the name of each of our sons plus their spouse, etc. I physically went to the lobby to check in with my two oldest sons and they ran my credit card information (although I was told when I booked the rooms, I would not need to be present). My third son was running late and so I asked if I could just check in for him and I was told I could. They ran my credit card for a third time and informed me he would only need to show an ID at any desk and would be given his keys. My sister had a similar experience, however, her one son checked in a day before so it was a reverse situation. Both my youngest son, who checked in without my presence, and my sister's son, who checked in before they arrived, were charged for the rooms. They asked both our sons for not only an ID but for a credit card for incidentials - neither one knew they would automatically charge $100 per room per day as they were not the ones who booked the rooms. My son was only charged the $100. My nephew was charged for both nights of the hotel stay plus $200 in automatic incidentals fees. My nephew didn't realize they were charging almost $500 on his debit card. Both my sister and I asked in advance, if we could pay for these rooms without any cost being attributed to our children and both of us were told there would be no problem. This is a beautiful hotel and the food for the wedding reception was outstanding. I would recommend this hotel for someone who is expecting to pay for their own room, but if you want to do a kindness for someone else by making a hotel experience a gift, I would find somewhere else to stay.",nan,nan,ta_s1231
trip_advisor,"We thoroughly enjoyed our stay. This was my first stay at the Swissotel Chicago. I have stayed at the Swissotel Shanghai and both locations are fantastic. We had the Lifestyle Suite on the 35th floor, the views alone were priceless. I am a SwissCiircle member so internet and bottled water in the room were complimentary. The location is perfect for shopping, dining, and sightseeing.",nan,nan,ta_s1232
trip_advisor,Enjoyed my stay at this hotel last year but poor experience this year. Good location close to shops and restaurants. Comfortable beds but toilet grubby and towels frayed (one blood stained) and worn. Strong smell of bleach. No coffee making facilities. TV remote difficult to work. Bottle water in room $8. Fridge not working. Conference in hotel who took over bar area. Made to feel you were intruding. Staff Christmas dance on and bar area closed. Wanted a nightcap but out of luck.On morning of departure we went downstairs to enter the passageway to shops to find carpets being ripped up and our feet sticking to the glue. No warning of work in progress. Staff only spoke to us when checking in and out were very polite but out otherwise ignored.Found it cold and impersonal.Would not stay again.,nan,nan,ta_s1233
trip_advisor,"Great location. A few blocks from the Mag Mile, Navy Pier and Millenium Park. I love the fact that all rooms here have a city view or lake view. There are many dining options, most are breakfast items. There's a convenience store right around the corner. They also have a mini-Mart inside of the hotel where you can purchase travel sized essential toiletries (a little overpriced, but you can consider it convenience tax). The beds are extremely comfortable.",nan,nan,ta_s1234
trip_advisor,"Stayed a long weekend and we found the Swissotel to be comfortable, conveniently located to downtown and in our room, QUIET.It was mostly a shopping weekend for the wife so we were able to walk from the hotel to Michigan Ave. NegativesA couple bottles of water would have been good in the room, but you have to pay 8$per bottle in room.I did not like the glass top on the desk as it was impossible to use your mouse when using your laptop. The TV remote was difficult to use. Had to press the buttons very hard to change a channel and placing a channel menu in the room would be nice so you know what's what on the TV without surfing.PositivesLoved the shower water, for some reason the water was not as hard as in most hotels, wasn't soft but not nearly as hard.Room had great blinds and was QUIET, huge plus.Fridge in room that I did not see on the web site but glad it was there.Bed was super comfortable.Overall, very nice and we'll be back",nan,nan,ta_s1235
trip_advisor,"In the past, whenever we have arrived here by car, we were immediately greeted by one of several doorman. My wife's door was always opened for her and our baggage was removed from the trunk. Respect and politeness were always the orders of the day. Not anymore by a long shot. We recently pulled in, were kind of ordered to park "" over here"". No one opened my wife's car door and I lugged the baggage out of the trunk myself. Not a big deal for me but we both felt like the caring was definitely gone. The same thing happened when we left the next day. The bellman didn't really want to get our car delivered to the front but rather we should go to the basement and get it ourselves. When it arrived, they parked it away from the front door and no offer was made to open any doors, lift the luggage or even say anything...except to take our tip. I can take the rudeness but shame on you for not respecting my wife!We had checked in ""in advance"" on the computer, before we left, as an email from the hotel suggested we do to make check-in a breeze. We had made reservations six months in advance and requested one of several rooms we have had before. We were told this would not be a problem for Swiss Club members such as ourselves.Advance email check-in meant nothing we soon found out. We told them we'd be there at 1:00 pm and arrived at 1:10 pm. ""Sorry, not only are the rooms you requested not available and won't be, but no rooms would be available for 2-3 hours!! "" ""Just have a seat in the bar or go shopping and check back after 2 hours"" Oh yes, there would be a room or two available immediately, but not the kind we wanted. So we waited for two hours and finally a room became available. Turned out to be an excellent room and we were happy. We just wish they wouldn't offer fancy emails etc. to ""save you time"" and make promises they can't keep. We also wish they would bring back the previous check-in personnel who always made you feel very welcome and had a particular charm about themselves. This time we felt we were just checking into a hotel and they were neither happy nor upset that we were there. We were just plain old people....but they were quite willing to take your money!Check out result in a double billing for a $67 over night parking charge. They suggested we had brought two cars and parked both. Another feeling like we were just people they needed to move on. We worked out the credit but this kind of thing should never happen at this hotel.On the bright side, Troy, the bar tender was perfect. Fun to talk to, knew his wines and other drinks, and truly went out of his way to make you feel welcome. Way to go Troy! You could teach the front desk and bellmen how to treat people and how to welcome guests.Also, another plus is their excellent breakfast offering and the people who wait on you. Very nice and they too have always made us feel welcome. They even remembered us from our last visit.As a foot note, we suspect that our treatment was the result of driving our much older car in ( 2002 Toyota Avalon and not our new Avalon) and being dressed in just plain older clothes instead of or more dressy ones, just may have played a role in how we were treated. I hope not but it sure seems to fit.",nan,nan,ta_s1236
trip_advisor,Arrived at Swissotel Chicago for a Holiday play and shopping on the Mag Mile. Location was perfect for both the shopping district and theater district. The hotel itself was spectacular and we secured a fine deal for the 2 rooms which are very modern and well appointed. Check in/out was very efficient and courteous. We enjoyed our stay at the Swissotel Chicago.,nan,nan,ta_s1237
trip_advisor,"The Swiss Hotel is located close enough to Mag Mile but away from the congestion of traffic and thus is a great stay for business or pleasure. The rooms are modern and above average in size. Have all the typical amenities expected in a full service hotel. Note the parking cost and the extra cost for WiFi in the room. The hotel food is comparable to the other hotels in the category ie Westin.There is a good steak restaurant (Palm Restaurant) adjoining the lobby, I think the Swiss Hotel has a great staff, especially the front desk. Always had a great experience whenever I am in Chicago.",nan,nan,ta_s1238
trip_advisor,"Our stay at this hotel was unique in a few ways. One, the elevators do not have numbers on the inside of the car - you have to ask for an elevator by floor and it will assign one to you. This is difficult if you get the number wrong or change your mind about which floor you want to go to. Second, they have a green option that gives you a $10 per day credit for food if you forgo housekeeping. However, you need to ask for this at checkin or hang the correct sign on your door the first day - the do not disturb sign will not get you this credit. Next, there is a charge for internet but you can get free internet by signing up for a special plan which is free at checkin. I'm not sure what the purpose of this is since I'm sure everyone does it but oh well. We had a corner room with guaranteed view. I suggest you ask for the North corner as we had the SW corner and the view was limited - you had to stand at the window to see the river or lake. Otherwise it was nice and clean. I did a spa treatment which was lovely ansd I recommend it. The best part of our stay was dining at the Palm - fabulous! And they do a great job getting you a taxi out front. While this is not a 5star hotel it is nice and I would stay here again with the above mentioned things in mind.",nan,nan,ta_s1239
trip_advisor,"LOVED the Swissotel in Chicago. The place was beautiful and the staff incredibly kind and accommodating. The hotel is in the center of everything so this is the location you want. We used valet parking at the front door of the hotel but booked it on-line prior to our visit and a much discounted price. I also got a heck of a deal booking the hotel on-line.The interior is sleek but warm and welcoming. The bed was AWESOME, beautiful room with beautiful view and huge bathroom. The fitness room, pool and hot tub had long hours at no extra charge - very nice.I'd stay there again and again!

The hotel also takes security seriously, which I appreciated. I came back while the lady was cleaning the room and she even asked me to scan my key card. The attention to detail and training was apparent in everyone that I interacted with at the hotel and I'd certainly stay again.",nan,nan,ta_s1241
trip_advisor,"My partner and I decided to go check out Chicago for a long weekend back in Chicago. The front desk attendant was super. She saw that my partner was French and began to speak to him fluently. Come to find out she grew up less than an hour from where he lives. We got a higher floor room facing Lake Michigan with views of the Chicago River. Awesome view! The room was comfortable and spacious with a nice bed and roomy bathroom. Our only issue, although it's kind of funny looking back at it now is that when we got our room key pass and went into our room, there was an interesting skunk-y smell (I'll leave you to guess what this was) when we opened the door and as we walked in, I saw that the room was already occupied. We shouted ""We're sorry"" just in case someone was in there and ran out and shut the door. I guess this might have ruined the experience for some but it really did't bother us. The front staff was very apologetic although it would have been nice to get an upgrade for our embarrassment :-P",nan,nan,ta_s1242
trip_advisor,"I stayed in this hotel at the end of August this year. I thought I'd give it a few months before writing a review to see if my feelings towards the hotel improved but they haven't. The wifi is ridiculously expensive and I was certain it was advertised as a hotel with free wifi on a well known last-minute style hotel booking website I used. Shortly after I stupidly paid the $25 or so fee for 24hours access, it went down and didn't come back up again. I called a few hours later to ask why it wasn't working, and was told ""we will have an engineer here in the morning"".The hotel is in a nice location and the rooms are great, as are the facilities, so it's a shame something like charging for wifi means I will not stay here again. It's 2014 - even coffee shops have free wifi these days.",nan,nan,ta_s1243
trip_advisor,"Was there for 4 days, and everything was very good, I am not a fan of paid wifi, but sometimes it does helps you to forget about the social media.Location its quite good, you have views of the river, about 4 blocks away from the Millienium Park, and probably around 5 min, to the Soldier Field.Rooms have enough space, room has a safe, an umbrella just in case you need it but just keep in mid its not for free, theres a parking fee, keep in mind that you might not need the car (if you are from out of the country). Next time Im in town, I would go back, for sure, such and amazing stay at this hotel !!",nan,nan,ta_s1244
trip_advisor,"Our dealings with the front desk made the hotel seem rather forbidding. They seem to have to deal with a huge volume of guests andthere always seemed to be a queue. It's a popular conference venue so there always seemed to be a huge volume of traffic through the foyer and around the entrance. It's certainly not calming. The foyer isn't the most welcoming or inviting of places to be honest. Our room, on an upper floor however, was large, very comfortable and secluded. The hotel is very centrally located, and very convenient for the sights and shopping. The pricing regime is a tad cynical, but not wholly unusual in some US hotels. As far as I recall, if you want an upper floor or a lake view,the price rockets beyond what seems reasonable. Fair enough but do check it out before booking. We're fans of Swissotel and are regular guests with them elsewhere, but we tried the JW Marriott on our most recent stopover and found it a much better place to stay for a similar price.",nan,nan,ta_s1245
trip_advisor,"I stayed several nights at the Swissotel The experience was as positive the last day as the first. I found the staff to be gracious and helpful with every encounter each day, including the front desk, waitstaff, housekeeping and the managing staff. Amy H was especially helpful and even remembered my name after the first day! I was impressed. My room had an amazing view of the lake, navy pier and downtown. I will try to upload a night time photo. My room and bed were very comfortable; lots of outlets at desk and bedside table level. I had room service - great service and very good food. I ate at the lobby lounge. Do try the fried avocado - sublime, seriously. I left two of my favorite sweaters in a drawer and i received them at home a few days later. I had a long and high pressure meeting. My room at the Swissotel was my oasis! Thanks to all of you there.",nan,nan,ta_s1246
trip_advisor,Swissotel is a modern hotel conveniently located a few blocks from Michigan. The hotel has nice views of the water and Navy Pier. The gym was nicely equipped and offers fabulous waterviews from the 42nd floor.I was just surprised the hotel does not provide free Wifi at least in the lobby nor provides coffee or water in the rooms.,nan,nan,ta_s1247
trip_advisor,"Stayed here for business - staff was helpful and polite. Very chic hotel. Room was nice, but housekeeping was missing the basics like dusting light fixtures, pictures, etc. Bathroom floor was cracked, obviously coming from the shower door that didn't close thoroughly. Had trouble maintaining a comfortable room temperature at night. Great view of the city and the lake. Bar downstairs had great cocktails and shared plates. Breakfast was yummy - but pricey. Overall, I'd recommend -- but paying for wi-fi, come on now - I've stayed in lesser hotels that didn't price gouge for wifi.",nan,nan,ta_s1248

Although offering an innovative centralized elevator calling system, waiting time for elevators was quite long in many cases... Not sure there is improvement to traditional approaches.",nan,nan,ta_s1249

After walking from Union Station - which wasn't the best decision, but that's what my partner wanted to do - stepping into Swissotel was a transition into comfort and luxury. At checkin, my room was upgraded to a suite on the 40th floor with an AMAZING view of the city. The front desk staff was helpful and courteous. I didn't go down to the bar, but my partner did. He said the people working and drinking there were pretty chill. We went swimming, too. The pool is nice but there were lots of kids, so maybe it could have been relaxing at another time but at 9:30 p.m. on a Friday night it was pretty noisy. I also did research on ""green"" hotels before I booked, and the Swissotel sustainability plan is impressive. Super comfy bed. I loved the products in the bathroom. Overall, this is a pretty ballin' hotel!",nan,nan,ta_s1252
trip_advisor,"Great location right on the river. The hotel was as expected. Quick check in, knowledgeable and friendly staff. My room was on the 25th floor and had an incredible view of the sailboats moored on the lake. The bed and pillows were dreamy. The bathroom was large, well stocked with fluffy towels and toiletries. They also have a well stocked 24/7 store in the lobby which has snack and water. It was a quick work trip and met all my needs. I would definitely stay here again.",nan,nan,ta_s1253
trip_advisor,"Such a great location - our upgraded corner suite offered an absolutely breathtaking view of both the city, Navy Pier, and the sunrise over the lake, as well as a gorgeous little peek-through of Millennium Park. The immediate area is quiet and easily accessible. Check-in experience was lovely but the suite we upgraded to was found with leftover garbage and food from the previous guest (food was rotten in the fridge, so it had been there for a few days at least). We called down to ask for an audio cable to be able to use the BOSE-system in the room and sadly, no one was able to help.Turndown service was a nice touch and housekeeping did a great job every day. Bed was unbelievably comfortable. Would stay again with a few minor tweaks.",nan,nan,ta_s1254
trip_advisor,"Stayed on Michigan Avenue previously but this location is far better, the best of both worlds with stunning views of the River, the Lake, the Millenium Fountain (which sprays across the river every hour on the hour) and the Navy Pier plus all the shopping you could wish for a ten minute walk away. Stunning room, first class fixtures and fittings, beautiful bathroom. Only one snag with the room the safe did not work and when a guy came to check it out he found the batteries had been stolen. He came back with batteries and left but there was not battery cover so we ended up holding the batteries in with cellotape. Only a small issue but maybe this should be part of the room check when servicing following a check out.",nan,nan,ta_s1255
trip_advisor,"My fiance and I love to stay at this hotel when we just need to get away for the weekend. You do have to pay for the fitness center and the pool if you are not a member of their rewards club, which is free. Quick fix. This hotel is a quick walk over the bridge to all the main shopping and not far from most major attractions, and, most importantly to us, is not located in a noisy area. The rooms are comfortable and the bathtubs are large. This place always makes us happy.",nan,nan,ta_s1256
trip_advisor,"The location of Swissotel is its absolute plus, walkin distance to lots of things. Room was big and clean, very good service.Thank god we came by plane and not by car as the garage is ridiculous expensive for guests.Check in and out worked well, concierge and all stuff really friendly.Pool in the last floor is a bit small and lacking the view, especially as it is in the last floor.Strange was that there was no coffee making facility in the room, we had that so far in really all hotels in the states even in ways cheaper ones.Hotel can be recommended without doubts.",nan,nan,ta_s1257
trip_advisor,"Arrived with a great deal of luggage. No assistance offered..... Moved inside hotel to be greeted by what looked like a row of small airline checkin desks. Found someone to check us in who was not particularly friendly. Got ourselves up to our room (still no offer of assistance) which was very nice. The lifts are super electronic which at first puts you a bit off balance but is ok by the time you leave! Breakfast was good and our server, David, was lovely. Second morning we had a different server who was verging on rude. So service is unreliable. Location of hotel is excellent. But there are a few service-related issues which really should be addressed.",nan,nan,ta_s1258
trip_advisor,"We truly enjoyed our stay at Swissotel. There is, honestly, nothing extraordinary about this hotel, except one thing... the view. I booked this hotel, for my husband and I, for our stay during the IMTS show, after our first, second and third choice hotels were all booked. I knew nothing about the hotel, but it seemed to have a good location, on the river, right off Michigan Ave. I saw that corner rooms were available, and having had good look in the past with the views from corner rooms in other hotels, booked it. We were shocked into giddiness when we walked into our room, on the 22nd floor, and saw the spectacular view we had! Because the hotel is a triangular shape, a corner room has an extreme angle from one side to the other. To the left, we could see all the way to the Trump Building and down the Chicago River towards the Corn Cob Buildings and the Sears Tower, and to the right we could see the full view of the lake and the Navy Pier... and more of the Chicago River between the points. At night, the lights were spectacular. The windows were huge all the way around, so the light just filled our room during the day. We felt like we were living in a glass house. One morning we woke up to a rainy, stormy day and it was really fun! It really gave you the true Chicago experience. I don't believe the corner room was much more in cost than any other room, as well. But, if you request a corner room, be sure and ask for the corner that overlooks the river to the left and the lake to the right. (There are 3 corners, of course!!) One corner overlooks Millennium Park and the lake, and one looks over to a not so attractive side of the city. Also, be sure and ask for a high floor.The Lobby was very nice with a lovely bar, and good appetizers. The elevators were speedy and never had to wait very long, even though the hotel was full, as there were many of them. The concierge was helpful, as well. We had lunch at The Palm the first afternoon, and was not too impressed, so we did not eat there again. We had room service one night when we were too pooped to go out, and had a great dinner of pizza and a specialty salad that we shared. As well, we had a great breakfast in our room but after the really high cost of breakfast (almost $100 for 2) we did not do that again. It really is shameful the way hotels (most all hotels, not just Swissotel) charge outrageous prices for room service, especially breakfast. I feel like they really take advantage of tired travelers... the fees tacked on for delivery, as well as the food charges themselves, feels like price gouging. But, alas... Will definitely stay here when we come back for IMTS again in 2016!",nan,nan,ta_s1259
trip_advisor,"The toilet would not flush all week, because the chain was disconnected. I reported this to the help desk, concierge, and other staff numerous times. The technician used a plunger each time, but the water would not refill. On the last night, a different technician said, ""OH!"" He attached the chain and it worked properly. It was very inconvenient to use the other restrooms in the hotel during my stay.The conference food and service was very good and servers were attentive.The conference audio/visual technician was knowledgeable and attentive.The head of my bed was immediately next to the elevator shaft. It made annoying noises all night, the first night I assumed it was a subway nearby.The fitness room and pool are beautiful, well maintained and a tremendous view.",nan,nan,ta_s1260
trip_advisor,"When we arrived, it was sooooo hot in our room. The air conditioner was not working. When I called, the guy took the filter out and it was disgusting!!! Looked like it hadn't been changed in months. After he left, I wanted to take a nap after a long drive. Someone came to the door. It was a different repair man. He said he was there to fix the air conditioner. I told him someone had already been by. The guy said ""oh, ok. sorry, they didn't tell me."" the toilet didn't flush well and it kept running and running. the light switch in the bathroom was falling off of the wall. i went to buy a soft drink at the front desk. as i was standing in line, no one even looked up and acknowledged me. i stepped over to the bar to see if i could pay for it there and the bartender was so rude. you could tell he didn't want to be bothered by me. it hotel was nice, but not over the top fancy. for $380 per night, i thought it would blow us away. they fell very short.",nan,nan,ta_s1261
trip_advisor,"If you're having a family event or romantic occasion, I would not recommend this hotel. I believe this hotel is best suited for business travelers attending conferences because hospitality and customer service is a secondary priority at this property. None of the employees seemed particularly happy or welcoming, which makes me wonder how they are trained and/or treated themselves. There is a very impersonal atmosphere to this property, which I would describe as cold and business-like. Swissotel is not a particularly special property: while some of the design elements are cool, the rooms are too sparse with low ceilings. There is no coffee maker in the room, which is also by design: it forces you to order room service for a $17 pot of coffee! Ironically, the layout of the hotel is in the form of a triangle, so ""corners"" are a definite theme here. I just don't like feeling ""cornered"" into paying exorbitant amounts for things that should already be included at a better property. The hotel is located in a fantastic neighborhood. The neighborhood is quiet and does not have a manic vibe (unlike the frenetic Michigan Avenue) and very close to everything. There's a lovely view of the Chicago River and Navy Pier, and quite a good view of downtown & the Wrigley building. A Mariano's is to the South, which is an upscale fresh market.If management from Swissotel is reading this review please know that minor things like having ability to make a complimentary coffee in one's room and take a complimentary swim do matter to guests. Friendliness also matters! It IS the hospitality industry after all. I do not expect fawning attention or over-the-top cheesy friendliness, which we can all agree is disingenuous. But a smile here or there and a happy-to-help-you attitude from staff goes a long way! Cutting corners to make an extra buck from guests leave them feeling that they have not experienced hospitality at all. If you think your guests are not special they will also leave feeling that your property is nothing special either.",nan,nan,ta_s1263
trip_advisor,"The hotel has a great location near the Chicago shoreline, millenium park and along the mouth of the river. The rooms have a modern layout and design and beds were very soft and comfortable. Gym facilities are avaialble as well as small heated pool. Staff were helpful and accomodating.",nan,nan,ta_s1264
trip_advisor,"We booked our reservation ""blindly"" through Hotwire.com for an amazing price. We had a room on the 16th floor and views of the Navy Pier were spectacular. The check-in was quick and when we requested a room on the higher floors the front desk agent was more than happy to accomodate. Rooms are large modern and shiek. Bathroom boasts a large tub and a separate glass shower. Lots of space for a family of 4. Wifi, Gym and pool now included, if you sign up for their Swissotel Circle card in advance of your stay. It's free and only takes a few minutes to register online. Gym supplied panoramic 42nd-floor views, updated equipment and an indoor pool. Hotel was walking distance to Magnifient Mile. Taxi's always available at the front of the hotel or a ten minute walk to State/Lake subway station. We did not take part in the hotel restaurants but I have eaten at the Palm restaurant in Las Vegas and the food is something to brag about. As it was the Hockey Playoff season during our visit, we did enjoy time at the hotel bar to watch the games. The drinks, while a little pricy, were very tasty.",nan,nan,ta_s1265
trip_advisor,"This is a first class hotel beginning when you step up to the reception. Our experience was with a super exceptional receptionist named ""Chenge."" Sorry if I slightly misspelled it.He was so friendly and willing to assist us with any of our needs. He remembered our names each time we passed through the lobby. My husband and I were there as the beginning of a Pullman Train Journey on the ""City of New Orleans.""We were given an exceptional room as I'm sure most of them are. The room was beautiful, clean, tastefully decorated. Every detail was special and quite memorable.Thanks to the management for their excellent job and a special thanks to ""Chenge.""",nan,nan,ta_s1266
trip_advisor,"We were looking for a hotel with a pool and close to Michigan Ave. Location was difficult if you're planning on walking the Mag Mile. The first room smelled of smoke and my wife's hand swelled up within minutes of checking in. Toilet seat also had stains so we asked for a different room. Front desk put us in a different room but was indifferent with little apology. The pool was serviceable, but the hot tub was disgusting. We hurriedly got out after seeing what looked liked mold in numerous spots. I would not pay full price for this hotel.",nan,nan,ta_s1267
trip_advisor,"Check-in was simple, however as soon as you enter the room you are greeted by a musky smell of a dated hotel room that one can only presume had been smoked in many times since the last update of this hotel. The bathrooms have finishes that will never look clean even if they were indeed spotless, thanks in part to the 1990's intimate fascination with the color beige.The desk and tv console are separated from the wall, leaving about a footlong gap from the wall because they couldn't figure out how to get an extension cord back there, and on top of that there are specks of some sort of historic splatter on the wall to the left of the tv. There are no accessible outlets next to the bed, so your cell phone and ipad will have to be plugged in next to the tv on the other side of the room (these things weren't an issue when this hotel room was last updated).I wasn't expecting the Ritz, but this is in no way a four star hotel. On top of the outrageous price they have the audacity to charge for this room, they also will not provide a travel size tube of toothpaste without an additional fee. When I told the concierge that this was not indicative of a luxury hotel, he said my other option was to wait for the CVS to open at 7am.Thoroughly unimpressed, and I'm very glad there are only one of these atrocities in the United States.",nan,nan,ta_s1268
trip_advisor,"The hotel staff gave me a friendly and adequate greeting when I arrived to the Swissotel. The hotel is in a great location - across the river from the mag mile and is a ten minute walk from State/lake subway station (go north and east when you come out of the subway). It is a 5 minute walk from millenium park and from the greatest breakfast place Wildberry pancakes on Randolph street. The first thing you will notice is that the elevators are very strange - you will have to key what floor you want to go to and it will direct you to the elevator that will take you there. This is great when you are the only person trying to get into an elevator but becomes problematic when there are many tourists who can't speak english and don't know what is going on. I had several people ride with me in the elevator thinking it will take them to their floors erroenously. I was trying to give them hand signals on what they had to do! The elevator was also excruciatingly slow in the mornings as it was trying to pick up people on every floor - you would be hoping that because it is computer programmed it would know not to stop on more than 10+ floors because it can't hold that any people! Otherwise the rooms were clean, modern and the beds were quite comfortable. I enjoyed the glass shower and separate tub. I would have to warn you though if you are a big person you will not get into the shower. Wifi is extra.",nan,nan,ta_s1269
trip_advisor,"Waited 45 minutes to check in. Hotel refused to provide me with an itemization for in-room-services. But, freely charged my credit card, for more than I had expected. And, I believe that I should get an explanation, a true itemization, but the person didn't get back to me, when they claimed they would. Beware, terrible customer service. Also, we were ignored at the lobby bar. I had to request service. it felt more like an overpriced 2.5 star hotel.",nan,nan,ta_s1270
trip_advisor,"Love the swissotel. Great atmosphere, great location, and great views! We came to Chicago on a busy weekend which meant the hotels were all pricy and nearly booked. I stayed at the swiss before and that was the first one I suggested. Sure enough it was reasonably priced in comparison to other hotels and they had rooms available. It had been awhile since I last stayed so I hoped the quality would be the same. The quality surpassed my memories and we had a wonderful stay. The room was perfect,comfy, and classy. We will return!!",nan,nan,ta_s1271
trip_advisor,Beautiful view of canal and Navy Pier - Close to both the Pier and the Magnificent Mile. Decor was simple and understated. Beds were very comfortable and the Baths were nicely appointed. Starbucks could be purchased in the lobby bar. Great valet service/porter.Negatives:No coffee/tea in the guest roomsConcierge was unable to adequately help us order food late one the evenings of our stay.Parking was $65 a night?!?! Room was very warm even with the thermostat set at 68 degrees.Pool was very small and completely over crowded,nan,nan,ta_s1272
trip_advisor,"Overall, our stay at Swissotel was great. The hotel was very clean and modern. We stayed on the 7th floor. The view was ok, couldn't see much but we were barely in our room so that wasn't a priority for us. My only complaints are the extreme cost to park overnight for guests. $65?? Really? Also, it would have been nice to have coffee in our room instead of having to go down to the lobby in the morning and PAY for it. Even a Holiday Inn has coffee in the room. A 4 star hotel like Swiss can't accommodate coffee? Was disappointed in that. Would like to know WHY coffee is not offered in the rooms. But we were very impressed with the staff. They were very friendly, quick service, and respectful. We were able to check in very early the morning we arrived even though our check in was at 3pm. That really helped our schedule so we appreciated the flexibility there. The beds were very comfy but if there was more than one person sleeping in the same bed, you would find yourself rolling into the middle of the bed.But overall, great experience. I would stay there again.",nan,nan,ta_s1273
trip_advisor,"The attitude and demeanor of the front desk girls was unacceptable. I have worked for the marriott in the past, and I would never have treated a guest the way I was treated. I would never think of staying at the swisshotel again in my life, and I have made that clear to any friends asking suggestions. The shower created a small flood every time it was used and nothing was done about it. Never again.",nan,nan,ta_s1274
trip_advisor,"If you are unfamiliar with Chicago & the layout, this is a great hotel that is CLOSE to many things, but slightly off the main drag of the touristy spots. Extremely quiet & clean hotel. That being said, if you hate walking more than 5 blocks, this is not your hotel...or city really. Chicago is very pedestrian friendly & as a resident of the city, this is one of my goto recommendations to friends/coworkers visiting. A few of the other ratings state that it isn't worth the price & there are cheaper options, but typically the Swiss is in line with others in its class. Marriott brands, Kimpton & even the Hilton (which I think is a dump). You are a 10-15 minute walk from River North, Navy Pier & literally 3 minutes from Michigan Ave. If you're lazy, the doorman will call for a cab, which should be $5-10. Maybe $10-15+ if you are going to the museums to the South. But the central location is key to any activity. As for close restaurants, again River North is nearby, but Three Forks (great dinner) & Wildberry (breakfast) are within blocks.",nan,nan,ta_s1275
trip_advisor,"My husband and I travel to Chicago frequently. This trip was for business. We were delighted with this hotel. Our room was huge. Wonderful view of the river. Huge bathtub. Great location. It was freezing cold outside with snow and we could walk many places underground. So convenient. The fitness center was amazing. I worked out more than usual due to such a nice experience. It is expensive, but so worth the price compared to other hotels.",nan,nan,ta_s1276
trip_advisor,"I have stayed at this hotel many times, it has always been my go to hotel in Chicago. I recently went on a four day weekend here, was in town for a wedding. The room had a spectacular view and was clean when I got there. The next first night I was there the internet was down, I woke up e next morning to find that I didn't have a coffee maker, I thought maybe they forgot it, I called down and was informed that they no longer provided coffee but I could come downstairs and buy a cup, order room service, or rent a coffee machine. I was shocked, the cost of my four days was 1200.00. I own a hair salon on the north shore of Chicago and when my clients walk through the door I offer them a cup of coffee or some water, or other beverage, they are a guest of my business and am honored they have chosen my business, offering a beverage is a universal symbol of welcome to my home, relax, enjoy. I even noticed you eliminated the complimentary water coolers in the lobby.  The second thing is the opting out of cleaning, I can get your green message as far as the reusing of towels and bed linens, but to not come take the trash, make the bed and wipe the glass counters which dirty from eating and drinking, how are we saving the planet by not emptying a trash can, on the third day I took the green plaque off my door and called down to the front desk that I needed my dirty dishes, coffee cups and garbage picked up, no one ever showed up so I cleaned it myself, found the service entrance in hall borrowed a vac mum and literally cleaned my own room, why would you not want to provide me with clean drinking glasses and take my trash?  The joke at the wedding became "" the hole I was staying at"" they had turned down service and all sorts of amenities for half the price, I have stayed at trump, which by the way was cheaper tonight online than the Swissotel by 75.00, they have Nepresso machines in your room and from the minute you walk into that hotel they are falling all over you to make you happy. The message you have sent to me is that you don't care for me or my stay at your hotel, message received. trump is now my go to hotel and will share this story with everyone of my chicago clients.",nan,nan,ta_s1277
trip_advisor,"Huge expenses abound as well as no many places to dine nearby. Views are nice. Room though lacks basic things easily found in much cheaper hotels. For the price I expect some basic things. Easy outlets to plug things into, a shower that doesn't have a broken shower head attachment as well as beds that have a a definite divot in it where many people have slept before. Move right or left and it's like you are trying to roll uphill. Room service is way expensive also. Parking at $65 a night is what I actually pay for hotel rooms that beat this place. Except for location I got to to say I am very disappointed in this hotel.",nan,nan,ta_s1278
trip_advisor,"the hotel could not have been in a better location. Central to all tours and walking distance to the Miracle Mile was great. The room was large and clean, bed very comfortable.

Will stay there again on our next trip to Chicago.",nan,nan,ta_s1279
trip_advisor,"Excellent Stay. Met with friends for a reunion, and the staff helped us get a suite that accommodated all of us. Hotel was in great shape, in a great location and we had a great time.

I would highly recommend this for folks staying in downtown Chicago.",nan,nan,ta_s1280

The pool was large and the gym equipment was plentiful and first class. There is no way this hotel is 50 in rankings. I've stayed at several other properties in Chicago ranked higher that are not near as nice. The breakfast was fantastic with more options than most hotels even think of. The fruit and chocolate covered strawberries really made things special.",nan,nan,ta_s1282

I have a family of four, so we stayed at a lifestyle sweet, which has a bedroom with two beds, a living area with sofa bed and two bathrooms. It was a very spacious suite. Also very clean, quiet and comfortable. My parents and my brothers also enjoyed their stay in different suites. The buffet breakfast that was included in our package was quite nice in the morning.

Our room was very clean, comfortable and contemporary, as was the lobby. The parking attendants were very friendly and helpful, but the parking was rather expensive at $65/night. Access to the pool and exercise equipment is not an extra charge as stated on their website.

We got a great rate through an independant booking site and would stay here again.",nan,nan,ta_s1284

You are also in the thick of downtown and energy is amazing. This a hotel with impecable staff. They also gave us great recommendations for breakfast that was within walking distance. I love the pool as it feels like you are just floating in midair as you can see the skyscrapers as you lounge.Makes me yearn to go back.,nan,nan,ta_s1285

The location of the hotel was fabulous, easy walk to everything. Would definitely return to this hotel on my next visit to Chicago. The only disappointment was that the executive lounge was removed.",nan,nan,ta_s1286
trip_advisor,"I recently stayed at the Swissotel in Chicago while my husband was on a business trip. The location was fantastic with beautiful views of the river and Miracle Mile and yet close to the Art Institute and all the Loop area has to offer. The hotel room was large, spotless and the bed was a dream. The bathroom was modern, clean and had I loved the artistic mirrors and how the shower adjustment was on the side of the shower you enter rather than under the spray allowing you to adjust water temperature without getting wet. The only drawback of this hotel is that the meal prices are geared to business travellers rather than tourists but then at a hotel like this you get what you pay for!The incident that precipitated my writing this review was the handling of an item I accidentally left in my hotel room. Two week after my stay I realized my error, called the hotel and not only did they still have the item (logged and registered) they immediately took the steps necessary to return my item. All this with courtesy and utmost efficiency! Anthony and Bernardo were especially helpful! Thanks Swissotel!!",nan,nan,ta_s1287
trip_advisor,"Booked this through Priceline and got a super deal. This being our second time to Chicago, I was a bit concerned it was a bit far from the Michigan Ave, but we found a short cut that got us to Grant Park pretty quickly. The Hotel is at the end of a street so lacking for food choices, but 5 to 10 minute walk will get you lots of choices.We came with our kids for four days before joining the in-laws in Saugatuck and came during Lalapalooza, security was very tight in the evenings and required your door keys to get elevator access. Plus when we checked in they had a code of conduct for all guests printed out. With the heavy party scene in the air we were pleasantly surprised at how quiet the hotel was! Once again I was disappointed with the lack of free WiFi (if McDonalds can give to their guests with $1 value menu item, why I can't get it at a nice hotel is beyond me) and we only found out on our last day that we had free pool access ... Nothing to write home about, we had more fun renting bikes and hitting all the major beaches.Our check in experience was very special as the gentleman who helped us friended my 5 year old daughter and every time we walked in he shout out to her and ask how his BFF was doing. The staff where excellent and with Lalapalooza over the weekend then Conventioneers the very next day... We had no other issues.I will add we took our 7 & 5 year old to Lalapalooza and the fact that we were much older than our music festival days, I was thrilled to take my kids to pretty awesome event ... Even if they were one of the youngest attendees around :)A standard 4 star Hotel that serves its purpose.",nan,nan,ta_s1288

trip_advisor,"Outstanding views and great location. Staff is great. We booked our room through Hotwire at a competitive rate. Our room had views of the Chicago River, Navy Pier, and Lake Michigan. We checked in late after a long drive and had a nice view of fireworks at the Navy Pier when we entered our room. Let me reiterate this...the view from our room was outstanding. The hotel is very clean and crisp. Our room was exceptionally clean and not damp. The workout facility is robust and is on or close to being on the top floor. The negatives we experienced were mattresses that were concave and in need of replacement. I could feel a few coils on one of the beds. The in room internet is spotty at best. There is no coffee maker in the room, which is fine, but typically there would be only one person working the Starbucks coffee counter in the morning. This resulted in long waits for morning coffee 15-20 minutes, as this person is making specialty coffees and serving baked goods. Minor problems that could be easily resolved with customer service, so I can't really knock them for that Overall we were extremely content and didn't bother complaining, but I let them know about the mattresses at check out. I would definitely suggest staying here and I would hesitate to stay anywhere else when I return to Chicago.",nan,nan,ta_s1290

trip_advisor,"This hotel is a really good place to stay if you want to be right downtown close to the river, Navy Pier, Millennium Park, etc. I stayed here overnight while attending Spring Awakening electronic music festival, which was held at Soldier field (close to the Museum Campus). The walk from hotel to venue certainly wasn't short, but it wasn't bad, either. Millennium Park and such are closer, and there are places to dine and I'm sure there is nightlife in the closer vicinity, as well. The hotel staff were courteous and professional (keep in mind this was a one night stay), and the room was clean (not impeccable), nice decor, and a really nice bathroom. My bathroom had a shower and a separate, larger-than-average jacuzzi-style tub. Overall, a good experience was had with this hotel. Oh -and there are some great views to be had from your hotel window!",nan,nan,ta_s1292
trip_advisor,"This hotel is centrally placed and near the river so you can walk to the main spots in the city. Navy pier, Willis tower and the bean were all within a manageable walking distance. After a long day, we ordered room service and it was very efficient and the food was enough to sustain us. The pool was a little shallow however it was clean and the jacuzzi wasn't hot enough but still relaxing. The fitness room was fully equipped and wonderful. We liked the slick building and the staff were very courteous and conversational. The room is large enough to accommodate many. Thanks for a wonderful stay!",nan,nan,ta_s1293
trip_advisor,"Stayed here for 3 nights and enjoyed the hotels location, welcome gifts and modern looks. Beds were very comfy but small, excellent river view, separate shower (very small if you are tall) and tub area. Room has a small fridge but no coffee/tea maker. Ordered a pizza from room service and it was horrendous! Tasted like cold, slimy cheese. Check out was a breeze. Valet was a joke!! $65 per night?! Ridiculous!!!",nan,nan,ta_s1294
trip_advisor,"The hotel is walking distance to many great destinations and a short cab ride to others. It is impressive, when you first walk in, but that is the lobby. The rooms are decent and mostly clean (although we found some funky stains in the bath room) and you have a little fridge (convenient) and the pool, hot tub, and work out areas are pleasant and well taken care of. Most of the rooms have a nice room too, especially as you go higher up (recommended). However, As another reviewer has already pointed out, the surcharges are outrageous. No coffee, no free wifi, and the room service is crazy pricey. My husband got a very good rate for the rooms, but we quickly realized the cost could escalate wildly. So here are some tips on how to keep costs down.*There is an 'office' area in the lobby if you must get on internet. Although we stayed 3 days, we decided on one night charge and made due with the many hotspots located in the vicinity.*My husband normally brings his own coffee, coffee cup, filters and cone. We didn't this time and regretted it immediately. Four cups of coffee the first morning cost over 20 dollars, and that's with me bringing them up from the bar area. After that we went out and got it locally.*Walk everywhere and find really cool short cuts (this city is full of sweet parks and gardens) plus you discover all kinds of charming neighborhoods, local color and people performing fantastic music on the streets.*Buy your food, water (its 8 dollars for the bottle in the room), and other necessities in the many little convenience stores locally. *Mariano's Grocery store (wonderful!) located in the cute park behind the hotel, Has everything you need food-wise and more. Great coffee, deli, prepared food and a sweet out door area to sit and enjoy your gourmet gatherings. I met many of the locals there and had some fun interactions. Prices are very good, about 1/4 of what you pay in the hotel 'store' and its a fun way to get a feeling for the neighborhood. Remember, you have a fridge in the room, but no freezer, so you'll have to eat all that ice cream as soon as you get back. Aw shucks.*Find some of the local treasures/ galleries/ restaurants/ music. I enjoyed the thoroughly savory fare and brilliant vibrant hues of the Black Coffee Gallery, right next to Marianos. Ask to see their 'book' which shows the many artists who have contributed. Its edgy and fresh, and the staff are super nice.*Feel free to ask for help from the staff. I found them really helpful and customer oriented. I think the hotel has done a good job in hiring young people from around the country and world who really enjoy what they do. They were all friendly, intelligent, and highly motivated.*Only use the phone for inside hotel calls. Make sure to use your cell for all else or the pay phone at Union station. Otherwise you pay $13 per call. *Do Not use the ATM on the lower level from the lobby. I tried to, and not only did they tack on 3.50 surcharges on their end, in addition to my banks fees for same transaction bringing that to over 5.50 just to get my money, but I never got it! The screen and receipt told me there was a 'communication failure' and to try later. My bank told me after I'd gotten home that my account had been debited for the amount requested (but never received). Avoid that machine and use one of the many other bank ATM's in the area instead.All in all a solid hotel and you can mold it into what you need. Enjoy!",nan,nan,ta_s1295
trip_advisor,"I paid $279++ through American Express Travel for my stay in July 2014. At that time, there were multiple conferences going on so rate was high. I've been monitoring their rate, and it goes down to low $100's during off-peak season. At that rate, it's totally worth it, but anything above $200 is not. The room was clean but a bit outdated in terms of furniture, bathroom, and decor. The view is excellent. Lakeshore East neighborhood is awesome. But if you are first time visitor to Chicago, want to tour around, this hotel's location is a bit out of your way.  I didn't try the Palm Restaurant this trip, but tried many times before. Lunch is well-priced and tasty, but dinner is a bit overpriced though their grilled lobster was delicious!",nan,nan,ta_s1296
trip_advisor,"This is a 4 star hotel that is well located in downtown Chicago. It bears all the hallmarks of its grade - including the price!It is the first US hotel. - or even motel(!) I have stayed in without any tea and coffee facilities in the room! I queried this with guest services and was advised I could either order a coffee from room service for US10, or buy a coffee downstairs from 06.30. No good for an early riser!This is 5 star profiteering at a 4 star hotel. At checkout I was advised to ""it changed in March; complain to management"".Otherwise, a good hotel.",nan,nan,ta_s1297
trip_advisor,So I went here on a trip I won through one of my distributors. After reading reviews here I found out they charge extra for Internet and rooms do not have coffee makers. Who does that anymore? Turns out my room had free wifi from the distributor. I asked the hotel to bring me a Krups machine for $15 but they forgot to on two separate occasions so they comp'd it. Rooms are nice and location is great,nan,nan,ta_s1298
trip_advisor,"We had a wonderful experience for our first time staying there. Pros - we arrived early (10am!) and they were so accommodating. We asked for the kids suite & they decorated it so nice with kids table & chairs, tons of stuffed animals, books & a game and Legos. The bedding was changed to kids bedding. Bathroom had rubber duckies all over the bathtub. There were child towels, soap dish, glasses & tissue holder & rug. So cute! Corner suite on the upper level (we had 35th floor) is the way to go. PERFECT view of river & lake/navy pier. We could watch Navy Pier's fireworks from our suite. The suite is soooo roomy & nice sized bathrooms/showers. Taxi service is so easy to get there. Staff very nice, friendly & accommodating! Breakfast buffet that comes with your room was very good. FYI - you don't need to tip the server at breakfast (we did with cash) & then realized after that gratuity is charged to your room. Not a big deal - our waiter was very nice but just something to know for our next visit. Elevator is NOT complicated. It's actually quite easy. Just updated in technology that others tend to fear.Cons - a bit longer of a walk to places BUT you can't beat the hotel spectacular views. Wifi costs extra - BUT - they will comp wifi service for you if you ask. Yes, valet parking overpriced BUT - for me, the positives we experienced over rides the cons. We hope to be back next summer & hoping they will allow us to request our same room!",nan,nan,ta_s1299
trip_advisor,"I stayed at this hotel a few years ago on a trip with friends. The hotel overlooks the Navy Pier and is centrally located so it was easy to either catch a quick cab or walk to wherever you needed to go. The room was comfy and clean and the bathroom was huge compared to other hotel bathrooms (with 4 girls trying to get ready all at once this was very important). The best part about this hotel, though, was the view. From my bed I could see the Pier lit up at night and it was awesome. I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone traveling to Chicago.",nan,nan,ta_s1300
trip_advisor,"Right when my co-worker and I got to the hotel, we walked into a customer talking with a janitor right next to my room enterence. we found out the reason why, there was a pile of feces behind the door. They did not offer to comp us anything, they simply ""cleaned it up"" which did not even get rid of the smell. We asked to be moved. They do not tell you to get wifi in your room costs an additional $15/day, pool cot $10/day. Just was not the best service, and the restaurant was not the greatest.The beds were comfortable, the elevators were kind of strange.",nan,nan,ta_s1301
trip_advisor,"Room was clean and comfortable. The room was also a decent size, where many seem to be really small. If you're a big person, you may not like the shower, it's a corner unit and not very large. I'm 5'11'' and 155 lbs., plenty of room for me. Location is actually pretty good. Easy walk to Millennium Park and all downtown restaurants. Even though there is a building in the way, I would ask for a Lake view, you can see the lake if you have a high enough floor. Don't eat at the hotel, venture into the city and find a good restaurant, there are plenty. I was there for a conference and the conference space was very nice and easy to access. Had to pay for WiFi, which I think should be included in the room.",nan,nan,ta_s1302
trip_advisor,"If you take advantage of their ""Going Green"" service, be aware they will not enter your room at all, to remove any laundry, dirty linens, remove trash, replace shampoos, conditioners, soaps. I thought it would just include maybe not vacuuming and leaving sheets and towels. For four days my room was not touched even though I called down to the front desk twice. :(Other than this, it is a wonderful hotel. Beautiful hotel, fabulous location, for the most part friendly and attentive staff.",nan,nan,ta_s1303
trip_advisor,"Stayed for 3 nights attending a weekend meeting held at the hotel. The room was nice & spacious - only downside was no hot water pot to make coffee/ tea as what several other reviewers had mentioned. Fortunately wifi was provided In the room as part of the package for the meeting, otherwise would have had to pay for it! The lift system is unique- just press the number of the floor you intend to go to- no buttons inside the lift- only at the lift lobby areas- makes me wonder about security as one usually uses the room card to gain access to the room floors. On the whole, it's a nice hotel with a convenient location to the Magnificent Mile & the Chicago Riverwalk amongst other places of interest.",nan,nan,ta_s1304
trip_advisor,"My wife and I recently spent a Saturday evening at the Swissotel Chicago following a concert. We have stayed there before, so I was familiar with its great location...and easy short walk (even shorter cab ride) to most places of interest.It had been several years since our last visit. We were extremely please with the upgrades and decor of the rooms as well as the common areas. Most importantly, the room, especially the bathroom was very clean!The staff was also very attentive and professional. At one point, I was in the lobby a few feet from the front desk looking around and one of the staff asked me if I needed change. Well that was exactly what I needed...still can't figure out how she knew that???We were very please with our experience and will definitely return.",nan,nan,ta_s1305
trip_advisor,"Pretty good location with great views, but overpriced hotel where everything is ala carte - it doesn't even have a coffee pot in the room! Unheard of! And Starbucks in the lobby is $4/cup. The room is confusing - the staff even said many people don't understand the stupid little nuances of the rooms. The manual doesn't mention many important things, like:You have to press a button on the refrigerator interior every two hours for it to stay cold!The lights and electrical switches are confusing - couldn't charge my laptop without helpManual doesn't tell you that Internet is free in the lobbyInternet is not free in the roomManual doesn't tell you that room service carries a service fee (food way overpriced)$65/night to park? Come on! That's even high for ChicagoBar staff acts like you are asking for the world when you want more of their munchies (must buy a drink and even then they are very stingy with the peanuts)Rude bar manager - overhead him berating guests and telling bartender to refuse drinks to themNo breakfast - NO FREE COFFEE in lobby except for 4-6 am! How cheap is cheap?Ditto no fruit in lobby - no cookies - not even mints - No Nothing but waterFitness center is nice - it should be for an extra $15/dayYou can save $5/day (big deal) if you don't have maid service but you have to use $ thereMy room had no card to hang to indicate no maid service, but others did - ordered by phoneConfusing as to how to get paper products if you opt for no maid serviceTHEY SCREWED UP MULTIPLE WAKE UP CALLS 4 TIMES IN 5 DAYSDesk is too high for chair or chair is too low for desk to write ergonomicallyPros: Nice down toppers on beds, they will hold bags for you for awhile, late checkout ok, offer to waive fees like gym or Internet (even they realize the fees are ridiculous)I wouldn't stay there again because of the above....if they were more reasonably-priced, had coffee pots in the room and spent a little time deciphering their confusing room nuances for guest, I would consider it.",nan,nan,ta_s1306
trip_advisor,"I stayed at this hotel while attending a conference. I had shipped a package to my name in advance, and the front desk staff alerted me to this at check in. Check in was easy. Nice large rooms, great fitness area, good location, poor internet connection. The day prior to checkout I asked for a late check out time of 1:00 PM, but was only given until 12:30. this was a hassle because I had a meeting. Other than that, the stay was good.",nan,nan,ta_s1307
trip_advisor,"We stayed there July 4th wknd. Although the hotel staff was excellent, the bartender and hotel manager need lessons in customer service. They also only had 1 bartender on one of the busiest days of the year. Waited over 30 min and waiter never came back to table. Finally found spot at bar and waited 20 more. Manager was rude and disrespectful and they even lost our signed meal and drink receipt amongst all the bad service and waiting. Will never go back again. PS the rooms do not have coffee makers cause they want you you to buy it!",nan,nan,ta_s1308
trip_advisor,"The Hotel was very clean, as the room. It is centrally located. However for the paid price I eould have expected free Internet connection, instead no way, internet at an n average price of 15 bugs for a day. Speed not fast.Internet nowadays is a must. How can you plan the day if you don't have access to Internet. Sure they say that in the lobby is for free. If you comeback from a long day or if you are hanger for conquering the city, you need Internet.",nan,nan,ta_s1309
trip_advisor,"I stayed here for three nights on a business trip in late June 2014. I enjoyed my stay and could find very little to complain about, although I only used the hotel as a place to sleep since I was out a work commitments from sunrise to past sunset.This hotel is located near the Chicago River, Riverwalk and all the attractions there. However, it is on an elevated roadway and there is not an easy or pleasant walk to get down to the Riverwalk from the hotel. It is also located near Millennium Park and there is a fairly easy and scenic way to walk there from the hotel.Tips:* The blackout curtains are between the window and the privacy curtains. Don't be fooled by the decorative curtains in front of the privacy curtains that don't go all the way across the window.* The bathroom light switch looks like a two-position switch, but it is actually a three position switch. Up is on. Middle is off. Down is dim (night light).High Points:* Everything in the room was quiet and there was little street noise despite being next door to the fire station.* Shower temperature and water pressure were good. Hot water from the sink faucet was too hot, but pressure was good. There was a bathtub in addition to the glass stall shower.Low Points:* The desk chair had tattered front corners, one with an exposed frame, padding and sharp fastener.* I wanted more lighting. There was only a ceiling light inside the door, a floor lamp next to the easy chair and an extremely dim LED desk lamp. No overhead light or reading light over the bed.* There is no coffee machine in the room. (Not a problem for me, but maybe for you.)",nan,nan,ta_s1310
trip_advisor,"The location of the hotel is superb, easy walking distance to State Street, the Miracle Mile, and Navy Pier. The hotel was nice.On the other hand we were not given the type of bed arrangement we had reserved several months before. Also there was a ridiculous charge for internet in the room, and there was no internet in the lobby. There was a computer for printing boarding passes.We did not have a car with us, but be prepared. Parking is $65/day in the lot closest to the hotel.Our beds were EXTREMELY overly soft and uncomfortable.",nan,nan,ta_s1311
trip_advisor,"This was our first stay in a Swissotel and it was very pleasant. We used Travelocity to get a good deal on a room and it happened to be at Swissotel. The lobby wasn't very large, but it was nicely decorated, and the staff was pleasant. The room was nice (as I would expect), and the view was impressive (25th floor). We only had breakfast in the hotel on the last day, and although the food was good it was overpriced. If I recall, the buffet was around $25 a person and the individual entrees (just eggs, toast, bacon, and some fruit) were about $12. If you didn't want to eat a ton it was better to get the individual entrees, but still felt just like standard food for the price.Also something that was interesting: the workout room and pool are on the top floor and have great views. The mens and womens locker rooms have showers that have one whole wall as a window; the mens showers have frosted glass but the womens' do not! I'm not sure if this is common in high-rise buildings.",nan,nan,ta_s1312
trip_advisor,"Stayed here for four nights while attending a conference at the hotel. Nice property in a fairly convenient location. Room was quite nice, though for some reason I had a hard time sleeping and I'm normally a sleep anywhere kinda guy. I don't understand why some hotels still charge extra for internet....feels like buckle and dimung and its a hassle to reconnect every 24 hours. Connecting multiples devices was a bigger hassle. Another issue was the service at the lobby bar during breakfast...more like, breakSLOW. had me running late a could times. Splurge on the extra employee and keep people happy.",nan,nan,ta_s1313
trip_advisor,"My husband and I stayed there for 4 days over the 4th of July. We had a good experience, customer service was professional and courteous! The only drawback for us is that wifi was not included in the hotel stay. For this being 2014, including Wifi should be standard. The Palm restaurant located in the hotel was top notch!! If you visit ask for Janet as your waitress she was excellent! I recommend the chicken Parmesan....which is one of their best sellers. We didn't upgrade our room but still had a nice view of the river from our room!",nan,nan,ta_s1314
trip_advisor,Stayed at the hotel during an weekend business trip to Chicago. This was my second stay at this hotel and the lobby area that was under construction during my last visit was completed.

In addition the hotel has a great location along the river. Highly recommend at this price point.,nan,nan,ta_s1315
trip_advisor,"situated in amongst the shops bars and restaurants, easy access to main areas of interest. Staff were very accommodating nothing was ever too much trouble. Hotel was undergoing refurb but this did not effect our stay. Make sure you ask for a coffee maker In your room or else you have to pop downstairs in the lobby to get a cuppa. Wine hour is a must ,lovely way to start your evening.Get the red line train from the airport and get off at Clarke and Lake costs 3 dollars each and is quicker than a taxi.",nan,nan,ta_s1317
trip_advisor,Though the hotel was under renovations while I was there the disruptions were minimal. Very small rooms but I was there on business so not really an issue. Very very nice staff. Could not be more helpful. Good restaurant. Only downside is that you must walk outside of the hotel and around the corner to access. Not so nice in rainy and cold April that Chicago is. I would recommend it overall as a well located business hotel..,nan,nan,ta_s1318
trip_advisor,"The walls are thin, expect to hear your neighbours, their arguments or the ""good mornings"" when they meet up.The bathrooms are closet sized and the bed is probably the worse Kimpton bed I've slept in but maybe it was just that it was a pillow top.The hotel was undergoing renovation but really didn't disrupt the stay. The adjoining restaurant was poor and I hope the food is next on the renovation list.Fitness centre had relatively big, varied (free weights, gym balls, machines) but no windows and opposite guest rooms.Amenities were CO Bigelow for Kimpton: relatively bland but well proportioned.Wi-fi dropped out now and again. The elevators were paradoxical in that they seemed so quick when you were inside them but you are left waiting for quite a while, particularly in the lobby area.",nan,nan,ta_s1319
trip_advisor,"First of all, our stay was amazing. Hands down our favorite Hotel in Chicago....as a Kimpton Karma Rewards member we get special rates, opportunities for upgrades and a $10 raid the mini bar coupon. Everyone gets a free 5-6 pm wine and beer reception every evening. When the concierge asked where we were going to dinner he called ahead as we were walking through the lobby and had the restaurant give us a complementary appetizer.The room we stayed in was smaller than before but it was still very comfortable....love the easy wifi, minibar, robes, yoga mat and 24 hr yoga channel. It had been redecorated. I think in the larger rooms the scale of the design in the carpet and wallpaper probably work better. Kind of a nod to Art Deco....The new bathrooms are really nice however. We did have one small maintenance problem with the toilet but they were there in five minutes....called us because we had left the ""do not disturb"" outside the door before knocking (I love that) and then were in and out in five minutes....crisis averted! Every single person on staff, whether it is the front desk, wine reception, bellman (who remembered us from a previous visit), concierge, doorman, maintenance, or valet is so friendly, polite, and accommodating...they treat us like we are millionaires (trust me we aren't). We love staying in the theater district whether we are seeing a production or not. Virtually on-site is Chicago 312, and excellent restaurant and small bar, and so many great restaurants within walking distance! If you don't want to walk, cabs are plentiful. We also love that this hotel is dog-friendly. Needless to say we have already booked our next stay.",nan,nan,ta_s1320
trip_advisor,"The hotel is under renovation but they do not do work until after 9:00 a.m. in the morning. I am not sure when they stop because I came at 7:00 p.m. and it was quite. Small rooms but very pleasant. Hotel staff are just the best. I had a 'ton' of luggage after a many week travel experience in many cities. I stayed with my daughter, who also have too much luggage. They had no problem with all our junk. The manager on duty could see my problem immediately and came to give me help. She was very professional and brought over a specific employee to give me a hand. Even though there is construction, it does not seem to be a problem. No problem with in internet and I am a high user of it at the hotel.",nan,nan,ta_s1321
trip_advisor,The allegro was undergoing maintenance but that in no way hampered my stay. The thing that I did appreciate the most about this hotel is that they actually have a light switch that turns on the light for the whole room.I'm really sick of hotels that just have a little tiny light above the bed and nothing on the ceiling.They rearranged my toiletries more than most hotels and even placed a couple of my things on a shelf across the bathroom that almost caused me to leave them behind.I sprayed myself in the face a few times with the shower because even after all of these years the faucet with the stick handle that you turn a little bit for the top and a lot of bit for the hand shower always result in getting sprayed out of the hand held shower sprayer.A good visit. Awesome location. Will stay again.,nan,nan,ta_s1322
trip_advisor,"Very Pleasant staff upon arrival. Found parking around the corner for $42 a night. The hotel itself is undergoing renovations, and I'm not quite sure if I had a renovated room or original room. The room itself was average to small in size. The bathrooom, while nicely appointed, was very small. The location is excellent if you plan to go to a theater show or view the Willis Tower. The 312 restaurant served a quick and delicious Eggs Benedict on Sunday morning.",nan,nan,ta_s1323

Hotel is under construction - limited in hotel choices for breakfast/dinner etc while construction is going on. Stayed in older rooms (not renovated). It is okay - small, desk faces wall - so cannot easily work and watch TV.Coffee in the morning was lukewarm - and wine in the evening was a nice touch. Overall the lobby is somewhat dim and the construction makes the whole thing less then it could be.Walgrens is right across the corner - and of course there are restaurants to go nearby.",nan,nan,ta_s1324

trip_advisor,"The bride booked a block of rooms here for her out of town guests. What a great hotel! Super easy ( and cheap! ) to get to from O' Hare using the blue line to Lake and Clark street station. It was 5 dollars and about 50 minutes. Easy peasy. The hotel is under renovation construction, but we only knew that from reading prior reviews and the first day we arrived ( friday) we could smell fresh paint in the hallway. Otherwise, we were not affected at all by construction. Some of the people from the wedding party who also stayed here complained about the room size, but we felt like the room was fine. It was clean, the bed comfortable, and fit our luggage with no issue. We were only there to sleep! Free happy hour! Hello! Beer and wine, every night for an hour. Great fun and a good way to meet other guests. We enjoyed that every night of our stay! The coffee is not the best, but complimentary. So there is that. Skip it and walk 4 blocks to Intelligentsia coffee shop. The staff was pleasant, professional and accommodating. Jean- luc, in addition to pouring a generous glass of wine and beer gave us an awesome dinner recommendation ( Sunda rocked, thank you! ). Kudos Jean-luc, kudos.the hotel was conveniently located near major theatres, good restaurants and millennium park. Good quality hotel for the money. I will stay here again when we return!",nan,nan,ta_s1326

trip_advisor,"The hotel was under construction during my stay. There was no construction noise at night, and the only issue I had was minor - only one elevator was in service for a period of time during my stay. I think they did a very good job of limiting construction inconvenience . My room was small, but very well appointed and quiet. I could hear very little street noise and did not hear people in the adjoining rooms. This hotel is located within a block of the Washington and Wells train station and two blocks from North Wacker. It is convenient to west loop businesses. I recommend this hotel for business travelers, but my room would have been very small for a family.",nan,nan,ta_s1329
trip_advisor,"Spent one night at Hotel Allegro in March 2015 for a random weekend in the city with my husband. Classic hotels in Chicago have great atmosphere, and when the Allegro finishes their construction, it should make a nice alternative to similar-style places. Until then, the hotel is more utilitarian. We did have a lovely stay, however. We were fortunate enough to be able to check in at 10 a.m. and were given a newly renovated room on the 19th floor. Fresh robes were in the closet, and fluffy socks were available for purchase. There was also a well-stocked mini bar/fridge. I will note that the bathroom was extremely small, even moreso than is usual with a historic Chicago hotel. It was also lacking a full-length mirror, an oversight I hope they remedy. The staff was extremely pleasant and helpful; one staff member actually walked us over to where the ATM was stationed, rather than just pointing the way. The cocktail hour is a nice touch, although I don't think it is enough to replace a full-service lobby bar. The hotel is clearly in a state of transition, so I will be interested in seeing what becomes of it in the future. One thing to consider when booking here: Location. The Allegro is very conveniently located to theaters and the financial district. However, the hotel is just far enough away from the Mag Mile, lakefront, and better restaurants to make walking a chore. The area tends to shut down by 10 pm, so late-night activity and dining is very hard to come by in that area.",nan,nan,ta_s1330
trip_advisor,"Charming old building retains much original detail with modern decor that works very well with it all. Great wallpaper, furniture, light fixtures & accessories in the lobby & first floor lounge areas. Wonderful places to read their excellent art books, have a drink, check your devices. Room was modest sized & totally adequate for 1 person. Staff members were friendly & tried their best to be helpful. I didn't give it 5 stars because it took hours to get my room ready (even though I told them what time I would be arriving) & the restaurant was okay but not outstanding. Walking distance to everything I wanted to do, including the conference I was attending. Will be staying here again this year at a very good rate & recommend it.",nan,nan,ta_s1331

In fact, Kimpton came in 11th in the survey! I have found all the Kimpton hotels excellent. The staff at Hotel Allegro is particularly attentive. The Hotel Allegro is well situated. We stayed because we were going to the Lyric Opera which is a short 5-minute walk. It is in the heart of the theater district. It is an absolutely great place to stay if attending a performance. The hotel is undergoing a renovation, but there was no problem with noise! My wife and I particularly like the complimentary wine hour! We will definitely be back!!!!",nan,nan,ta_s1332
trip_advisor,"Bed was fantastic, rooms are very small. Hotel is under construction so the check in is in a temporary spot. My room keys didn't work when I got to my room and the front desk person was not very sympathetic as I was carrying my bag, briefcase and boots up and down to have it fixed. Valet parking for $59 continues to be an issue so beware that if you get a good rate online, taxes are about 20% and valet parking is pricey. Good location. I will probably stay elsewhere next time as there are tons of choices as reasonable prices in this area.",nan,nan,ta_s1333
trip_advisor,"Booked online, it was noted they are currently under construction. Stayed over Valentine's weekend. Temporary lobby, nothing fancy, but functional. Service was excellent throughout whole stay. Booked room and valet package, highly recommend, because parking can be expensive. Good value for your money. Had sparkling wine and chocolates delivered to room, great touch!!! Loved the lobby drink service in the evening. Very eclectic, room small, but did not spend much time in the room. Yes bathrooms are very small, but nice updating and modern. Room clean. Valet service slow in the morning of check out, but their in/out service at other times was very good. Will stay again!",nan,nan,ta_s1335
trip_advisor,I stayed during a business trip and couldn't be happier with the hotel and service. The front desk agents were friendly and helpful. Every request/question was met with a smile and quick action. The room was small but very nicely decorated and comfortable. It was exactly what I expected. The wine hour in the lobby was a nice touch. It was a little strange that the lobby is on the second floor. The best thing about the hotel is the location. It's right in the theater district and short walking distance to restaurants and shopping.,nan,nan,ta_s1336
trip_advisor,"You discover it is under refurbishment only when you book the room, nothing wrong with it but I'd have rather preferred to know it in advance.My room was super tiny but nice with a strage steel like burnt wood that I have already found in some kiloton hotel. My suggestion? If this is your kiloton fragrance..look for something fresher and betterPeople at the front desk is ok except for one lady which was not helpful when my door key had a problem and she make me go up and down three times..very annoying. It is easy to be nice when everything works smoothly but it is when we need help that we see the difference in service..",nan,nan,ta_s1337
trip_advisor,"First of all the scented air in the hotel is gloriously refreshing and uplifting! Second, check in and check out is painless and the folks are friendly and cheerful. The decor is beautiful and comfortable. The whole atmosphere is inviting. The beds are divine, the rooms are attractive but not overdone. The full length mirror that's altered with a chandelier and an antique look could go (just not a fan and actually want to utilize the mirror) each bathroom would benefit from a magnifying mirror but it's no deal breaker. The location is perfect and there are two options for dining and relaxing without leaving the building. My sister directed me to Kimpton hotels and now I'm a true follower!

trip_advisor,"I stayed just one night for business and selected the hotel primarily due to its proximity to my business meeting. If you are interested in the theater, this is the place to stay. Generally, the service accommodations were excellent. The room was a bit small, but for my purpose was quite suitable. There is a complimentary happy hour from 5 to 6 and a very nice breakfast. However, I would not recommend the bar/restaurant on the ground level. One of the few meals in many years that I could not get through. Had to send most back uneaten.",nan,nan,ta_s1340
trip_advisor,"Check-in and check-out were a breeze. I've read lots of complaints about small rooms, but ours was quite big -- certainly big enough to do yoga on the thoughtfully provided mat. Since this is a renovated older hotel, there are some oddities -- the dark hallways, combined with the silvery wallpaper, gave it kind of a prison vibe, and the bathroom, though nicely appointed, was very small. The room was very quiet -- we didn't hear anyone else except for housekeeping doing their morning rounds. The front desk staff was very friendly. We wanted to talk to the concierge to make reservations, etc. for us, but never managed to find one--but I guess that's what smartphones are for. I stayed on a corporate rate, and I'd stay again: the location is terrific--in the middle between to the bars and restaurants of the West Loop, and the museums/Michigan Avenue.",nan,nan,ta_s1341
trip_advisor,"Was given a wonderful end suite at this property, loved the bigelow toiletries, the evening social hour 5-6pm with free wine, beers - was super! And the classic, modern, contemporary design throughout the hotel was superb. I loved the fancy cycling machine in the gym - amazing 3D like actually riding. You can tell the attention to detail this hotel has - it's great and it's my first time at Kimpton and i'll be coming back. Also as a Kimpton member, I was given a $10 mini bar credit and free internet - I love this chain of hotels... I hope they stay this amazing!",nan,nan,ta_s1342
trip_advisor,"Here for a conference; room was booked by my State workplace. It turns out that without a special form completed in advance, rooms are only RESERVED not PAID FOR... resulting in a $810 charge to my personal account which I will now have to fight for reimbursement. Not a nice suprise--I can only assume that the website is not very clear on the reserve/purchase issue, otherwise our financial person who does stuff this daily would have filled out the appropriate forms. And we're still waiting for the form 30 minutes later. This situation is why I'm rating it ""poor.""Other than that, the woman delivering the news of the devastating $810 charge was delightful, and visibly pained at having to charge me that amount. The place is cute--it's imperfections kind of make it. If you have a disability, you absolutely must tell them when you book your room. It would be impossible for a wheelchair or otherwise differently-abled person to navigate the room.There's also free wine from 5 to 6 pm--and for $810, I am going to drink buckets of it.",nan,nan,ta_s1343
trip_advisor,"The hotel was beautiful. The facility is older and the rooms were a little small, however, the service and the staff more than made up for that minor issue. We were in town for a wedding and the kindness that was bestowed upon my family members was more than I could have ever expected. All of the staff was extremely friendly and helpful with every contact from the counter staff, valets, and cleaning staff. The hotel is clean, quiet, and very comfortable.",nan,nan,ta_s1344
trip_advisor,"4 minutes from Clark and Lake ""L"" stop. Wonderful lobby. Nice clean room with a large built in wardrobe complete with bathrobes. Plenty of charging points including usb points. Big style digital clock, large screen TV and mini bar. Plenty of side lights and ceiling lights. Shower over bath; minor gripe if you turn the sink tap on mind you don't soak yourself. Hairdryer in the bathroom and a nice big wall mirror with decent lighting. Staff were friendly and there is a wine hour between 5-6pm when you can get a complimentary glass of wine or beer. The lobby bar food was good but the bar shuts at 10:30pm which we found strange. Yes we would stay again.",nan,nan,ta_s1345
trip_advisor,"I had to stay at the Allegro for business recently. The hotel is conveniently located close to the Clark/Lake metro stop and within the loop. Upon arrival my check in process was quick and painless. I signed up for the Kimpton Karma rewards program solely to get the free wi-fi the hotel has to offer. I seriously doubt I will be using it ever again. It was not that the hotel was bad, it was just that it was not quite my cup of tea. So I checked in during their happy hour they have everyday around five. Apparently they have free wine and beer but I just grabbed an hors d'oeuvre as a snack and made my way to my room. I did not really go to any of the happy hours so I could not tell you much. The room was somewhat small but not too small. There was a double bed and desk, chair, dresser, and TV. The first thing that hit me about the room was the decor. It was a good thing I did not partake in the happy hours, because if I did the wall paper would have made me vomit. It was so dizzying that I could not even look at it without feeling nauseous. I understand this is supposed to be a ""boutique"" hotel, but the decor really was quite obnoxious. The chair looked as it had been pulled right out of a movie about 1990s that was made in the 1950s. The carpet was also a bizarre dizzying zig-zag design as well. So not wanting to look at the decor too much, I watched TV. Which made it frustrating when their satellite dish service went out three times when I was there. I was only there for 5 days total and the TV went out on three of them. Not a very good ratio there. The closet was tiny, and 1/3 was taken up by their tacky bathrobe that looked raggy and old. Needless to say, but I did not even take it off the hangar. There was barely room for my three dress shirts in the closet, that's how small it was. I found myself hanging them in the bathroom. Which brings me to the bathroom. It was quite small but functioned as a bathroom. It was just several little things that made it inconvenient. The towel rack is in the shower, yup, IN the shower. So you have to move your towels every time you take a shower. The toilet paper is on a roll on the wall behind the toilet but in between the sink and the toilet. So you have to reach almost backward to get the TP. I found myself just taking the roll off the holder and leaving it on the counter. They provide soaps and shampoos just as any other hotel does. There is also a mini-bar but I did not use anything out of it. I needed toothpaste and they had some in the mini bar but I figured I would get some free toothpaste downstairs rather than pay $8 for organic toothpaste.  I called down later one night to pick up a burger at Encore, the on site restaurant, and it was pretty good, but nothing to write home about. Check out was easy and painless. All in all it was several little things that just annoyed me about this hotel. The bed was comfortable and it served its purpose, there was nothing that really blew me away that would lead me to call this hotel even ""very good"". I even waffled between poor and average before I told myself that it served its purpose and I had no bad interactions, my bed was made everyday, so it is pretty much just an average hotel.",nan,nan,ta_s1346
trip_advisor,"Our 2 night stay at Hotel Allegro was wonderful. The service was excellent and staff was very friendly. Although the rooms are small, we didn't mind since we were there to enjoy the city, and not spend a lot of time in the room. The walls are thin, but we had good ""neighbors"" so it wasn't an issue for us. The location is great as well. We were able to walk everywhere we wanted to go, but Taxi fare is very reasonable if that is what you chose. We will most certainly stay there again!!",nan,nan,ta_s1347
trip_advisor,"This is a lovely hotel in a great location in downtown Chicago. We stayed here for two nights for a family wedding (at the hotel as well) and had a wonderful experience. The El station is just a couple of minute walk, so we were able to get easy airport access without paying cab fares.",nan,nan,ta_s1348
trip_advisor,"For some bizarre reason, hoteliers love to label their hotels as boutique to cover up flaws. This is NOT a four-star hotel as we were promised when booking. It's a 3...and that's a stretch. Everything is old...interior and exterior...but not in a charming way; in a dirty, ready for renovation-type way. We checked in, contacted the booking agent and rapidly checked out. (It was not because the room was small as others have noted. It's NYC size..not teenie) If the complimentary wine/beer is incentive enough to stay here then it will probably work for you. Located in the theater district and middle of the Loop so there are many things within walking distance.",nan,nan,ta_s1349
trip_advisor,"The most notable thing about this hotel was the extremely poor elevator service. The elevators were too few in number, and too slow, to service the number of hotel guests. On more than one occasion, we had to wait 10-15 minutes before we could get on an elevator - they were all jam-packed. The hotel was otherwise adequate, although the rooms were small, and the free happy hour from 5:00-6:00 daily is a nice touch. However, the elevators made this hotel unacceptable.",nan,nan,ta_s1350
trip_advisor,"My husband and I like the Kimpton chain, this was our first stay in Chicago. The room was small but had what we needed and bed was comfy. It would be nice if all hotels would provide a complimentary bottle of water, what would it cost ? Less than a dollar !

trip_advisor,"Not what I would expect from a Kimpton Hotel!! However, the hotel has a beautiful entrance and lobby. The rooms are small, but have a contemporary decor and were sufficient for my needs. The 312 Chicago Restaurant was a bit pricey but the service and food were good.

Rooms are very well designed so even in small spaces all amenities were still available. Beds were super comfy!The complimentary wine hour was very well utilized and very much appreciated! For the rate and location (theatre district) - you can't go wrong with this little place. It even has a Starbucks on the ground floor. The only reason I'm giving it a 4 out of 5 (would give 4.5 if possible) is that the only thing missing is some type of continental breakfast.,nan,nan,ta_s1354
trip_advisor,"I stay here regularly, meaning more than once a month. So have stayed in multiple rooms and clearly it is not bad since I keep coming back. That said, it is not perfect or even great and there are some things you should know. The most important thing for anyone (I think) to know before you book: there is NO room service. That's right. NO room service. There are restaurants but they range from weekday-worker-fare to night-out-fare. So either fast food or expensive restaurant, not a lot in between. If you are there on a Sunday, a lot of the restaurants are closed including the hotels, Encore. The WiFi has a catch or a cost: to get free WiFi you have to sign up for their loyalty program. If you don't care, then you are golden. If you don't want them to have your e-mail, etc., then you have to pay and it is NOT cheap. The rooms vary significantly in quality, size and layout. Generally ask to be facing the street and on the East side of the building. This way you have some kind of view and are not disturbed by the El. It is a dog friendly hotel that does have a dog care package for check-in. Sadly you only get it if 1) the desk person is a dog person or 2) you ask for it. Most of the desk people will not offer it or even know where they are kept. Go to the Encore! The staff at the large bar is AMAZING! They will make you feel welcome, taken care of and appreciated. The small bar - not so much. This mostly seems to be staffed by pretty girls with scan brains and few social skills. The happy hour deals are excellent (often up to 50% off) and the food and drinks are good. Tequila Tuesday is my favorite - $2 tacos and $6 Margarita. 312 - where to start? The coffee is undrinkable and their excuse is that it is ""strong"". Strong does not make coffee bitter and that stuff is more BITTER than a divorced Desperate Housewife with a prenup. The food is good but expensive and the services doesn't make you feel like you are paying as much as you are. They seem to be understaffed for all meals. Go somewhere else. You know how some hotels the service is so good the stay is ""better than home""? This is not that place. The service varies radically and they need new management to provide consistent standards: the staff are either amazing (bend over backwards to make you happy) or incompetent-lazy. The porters for the most part will ignore you. They do not open the door (except for one gentleman), they do not get you a cab, mostly they stand around chatting, there does not seem to be much of a reason for them to be present. The desk staff is all over the place in quality and service. One thing the desk staff is really good at is never knowing who I am even though I've been there 7 times this quarter and always reciting the same ""welcome"" speech. Location, location, location. Really it is excellent. Quick walk to work. The kids were here and walked to most of the major destinations. Blocks to Millennium Park and all that has to offer. Blocks to the West Loop and the Sears Tower. Easy public transportation and to access to cabs. It is really convenient.",nan,nan,ta_s1355
trip_advisor,"I stayed here for the Chicago Marathon and it was very convenient for both the race and for entertainment and shopping. Being in the loop, I was very close to multiple L stops so I was able to get around town quite easily. Still, most of the places I visited were walking distance including museums and restaurants. Neighborhood was great and I had no issues walking around at night alone. The hotel itself is fun and interesting and I was given mini bar or hotel bar credits - good times!",nan,nan,ta_s1356
trip_advisor,"I am not a picky person by any means. And I've stayed in a wide range of hotels: everything from Days Inn to Waldorf. I booked Hotel Allegro as an Express Deal through Priceline (a practice I am coming to regret more and more). I will give the property this, the location was good for arriving from Midway and taking the Orange line into town. The hotel was approximately 1/2 block from the L station and about a 10 minute walk from Union Station. There was plenty of shopping and Grant/Millennium Park were a quick walk away (although be warned N State St and Michigan Ave shopping are kind of a hike). Now let me cover the major bases of my stay. As always, the room is first. Yes it is a boutique hotel so the rooms are smaller than in your typical chains and since this was an older building that was remodeled they are an odd often awkward shape. The king deluxe had a hallway with a closet immediately to the left inside the door, to the right the bathroom and then the hallway opened up into the bulk of the living space. The bathroom was clean but incredibly small. Since one single door wouldn't fit the bathroom is closed off by double wooden French doors. While standing in the tub you can easily reach the sink across the room. The toilet is in between and it is nearly impossible to maneuver around the room without some part of your body then touching the toilet. Getting changed in the bathroom itself would be nearly impossible. The shower head was typical hotel fare but had good pressure, however the faucet for the tub stuck out to far denying anyone who wanted to take a bath about 6 inches of tub space. The rest of the room is standard issue except one thing. The bed was the hardest, most uncomfortable bed I have ever slept on and I found myself tossing and turning and waking up still. It would be a good room if you were needing proximity to the theater district or you found a killer price online.  Many times in hotels with lackluster rooms I find myself thinking how great the staff was and how that really made a not-so-great room better. In the case of Allegro, Kimpton needs to step in immediately and do some customer service training. When we arrived at the hotel check-in was fairly quick. i advised the front desk that the next day I would be having a birthday cake delivered at 1pm and would be at the front desk between 5-6pm to pick it up. I was told this would be no problem and a note would be put on the account. When I went to get the cake the next afternoon, the young woman at the desk said she had no idea what I was talking about, that no cake had been delivered, and that was I sure I even ordered a cake. The cake had been meant as a surprise which failed miserably after my companion asked why I was waiting at the desk so long. Again, I was questioned if I'd actually ordered a cake, and then blame was shifted to the bakery who ""might not have delivered it."" After 10 more minutes of searching she finally came back with the cake. We went up to the room and since the cake looked beyond amazing (I will review them too!) we decided to have a slice. I called down and asked if 2 forks and 2 plates could be sent up. The voice on the other end hemmed and hawed a bit and then told me ""ummm yeah."" Only 40 short minutes later they arrived, although the young man who brought them up seemed apologetic and sincere. We headed out for dinner and as we came out of the front doors there was a doorman talking with another employee. We stood for a minute waiting to be acknowledged or asked if needed a cab. We were noticed but the two stayed engaged in their conversation. Annoyed we walked half a block down to a cab parked on the side of the street in front of the theater. The next day we checked 4 bags so we could explore the city before departing. When we arrived at the hotel at 6pm we went to collect our luggage (for some reason they don't have a bell desk so this entire process is contingent on someone actually asking if you need something). We were approached by the girl from the cake debacle who took our tickets and disappeared. After a few minutes she came back with one bag and then asked me to describe the others. After about 5 more minutes she came back with my luggage but we were short my companions last piece. She asked if there was another bag and if we were sure we checked it. We described it and she disappeared for another while before coming back with it. I almost felt like I was on candid camera. There is no other way to describe the staff other than either very badly trained or literally people they pulled off the street and hired. I can't imagine ever seeing this type of service at any other chain. Some other fun facts about the hotel? The walls are thin as paper: we not only got to hear our neighbor and her beau fight and cry until late in the evening but also got to here them make up the next day. At wine reception I was given the duty of telling anyone else that got in line that wine reception was over. The views from the rooms, at least on the 10th floor were of the street and a parking lot in which I got to watch people relieve themselves after Lollapalooza.The ac is jahnke and unless you want it 65 it will be 80. However, I will say the lobby was beautiful and the dimming lights next to the bed were also nice. There's lots of options in Chicago for you to lay your head in exchange for your hard earned money. I'm not sure I'd spend it at Allegro again.",nan,nan,ta_s1357
trip_advisor,"I booked this through the blind booking system on priceline, so I got the room at a much cheaper rate than was available on any other sites I'd found. I do not think I would have been happy if I had paid the rates on other websites.I got a ""King room"", and although it did have a king size bed, it was still a queen sized room at best. The room was clean with modern enough decor. The bathroom was absolutely tiny.The location is good - only a few minutes walk from many of the popular sites, and pretty quiet at night, though my room did not overlook the street. It's nearby the ""L"" blue line, which makes for a very cheap option to and from O'Hare. The staff were polite, if not overly friendly. WiFi is not included with the room.",nan,nan,ta_s1358
trip_advisor,"You couldn't ask for a better location. Walking distance to all major attractions. A subway line leading directly to the airport (no transfer) is a mere 2-3 minute walk away. Cost: $3 per person; as compared to about $50 by taxi.A number of reviewers were not happy about the front desk. Yes, the personnel there were professional without exuding warmth. Nor were they willing to accommodate beyond the book. Except for CHRIS. He is a gem who went backward to please. The major downside is the size of the room. They are tiny, especially the bathroom. The basin is almost on top of the toilet, thereby rendering little standing room. I would return, but will definitely ask for a bigger room.",nan,nan,ta_s1359
trip_advisor,"We were looking for a hotel with easy access to attractions and the trains and this hotel was just right. The wine social in the lobby each evening was a lot of fun. Two nights, there were people from the Field museum with insects, both alive and in cases. Everyone on the staff was helpful, even the porter telling us what local beers he thinks are the best! It was our first stay in a Kimpton Hotel and I don't think it will be our last.",nan,nan,ta_s1360
trip_advisor,"Boutique hotel rooms are smaller- I get it. But shouldn't they have a closet, especially if you book a king size bed in room for 5 nights ?

Went through talking to 4 different people about it, had to fill out a form, and 3 weeks later, I still haven't received reimbursement as promised.Really felt as though I was given the run around for a pillow, for Pete's sake! It was a Sharper Image pillow, so I was asking $75 to replace it and pillowcase.some of the other Kimpton properties may be worth checking out, but I'd steer clear of the Allegra, unless you really love free, cheap wine at their happy hour, and coffee in am (Coffee is good!)",nan,nan,ta_s1361
trip_advisor,"My wife and I stayed in this hotel for 4 nights in mid-June. We had a King Deluxe room on the 14th floor. Although clean, the small room was nothing to rave about. The bed was comfortable enough, but the roman-shade blackout curtains didn't do a good enough job of blocking out the morning sun. In general the walls of the room were paper-thin, so much so that we could hear our neighbor coughing and sneezing in the next room over! You can also hear housekeeping knocking on each door while making their morning rounds. At over $200/night my biggest gripe about this place was the bathroom -- it's one of the smallest hotel bathrooms I've ever seen! You can sit on the toilet with both arms outstretched -- one hand will touch the shower wall, and the other hand will touch the mirror above the sink. The counter space around the sink is minimal which makes it difficult to get ready for evening events. While this hotel is conviently located in the theater district, this area pretty much lacks nightlife so you'll have to head to the North-side of the river for hip bars and restaurants.The Washington/Wells Metro station is close by, as well as the Clarke/Lake station (the blue line will get you to and from O'Hare Airport). Chicago is an awesome city with much better hotels to stay at!",nan,nan,ta_s1362
trip_advisor,Fantastic experience! The Allegro is conveniently located in theater district and close to Metra stations. The staff is friendly and it has a wonderful boutique feel and look. Rooms are typically small for city hotels but exceptionally clean. The nightly free wine and appetizers in the lobby are an excellent way to unwind and start your evening. We stayed for an anniversary getaway to enjoy a play and dinner at the 312 restaurant located on site. The staff made us feel very welcome and made a special effort to help us celebrate our anniversary by giving us a top floor room and Champagne and dessert voucher for the 312 restaurant. This hotel is a perfect spot for a reasonably priced but wonderful place to stay downtown Chicago.,nan,nan,ta_s1363
trip_advisor,Stayed two nights with my wife at start of a road trip. Registration was quick and easy. Room was away from road and on fifth floor which meant it was lovely and quiet. Rooms very clean. Only real complaint was continental breakfast. We were given cards to hand to servers which entitled us to small bowl of fruit and two slices of toast plus Orange juice and coffee. Anything extra was charged which to me seemed to be a rip off. Overall though a good hotel in a great location offering value for money other than breakfast.,nan,nan,ta_s1364
trip_advisor,"There were a lot of good aspects to this hotel: The beds are very comfortable, the staff was friendly, it's in a good location, and it has the good Kimpton touches of the evening wine hour, morning coffee, and nice robes. The rooms were small, but okay. WiFi should be free for everyone, but it's free if one joins the loyalty program. There were two main problems. First, the bathrooms are extremely small. There is very little room to put anything, the tub/shower is very small and the water temperature was hard to adjust, and the towels were small and mostly pretty worn. The other problem is that the rooms aren't very good at keeping out sound. The hotel is dog-friendly, which is great, except for when the dog in the next room starts yapping in the morning.",nan,nan,ta_s1365
trip_advisor,"The location of the hotel was fab. If you are not going all out with the limo or taxi service with the transportation to and from the hotel - this is the hotel to go to.I took the direct train from Midway international airport to Wells/Washington stop - took about 35 mins, with a 5 mins walk to the hotel. From the hotel, you could walk everywhere - federal bank of Chicago, theaters, Cloud gate. They have free bicycles which you could borrow too [free].Service was mediocre but consistent of the Kimpton chain. Nothing to WOW about, but nothing to complain either - conducted in a business-like manner. Early check-in was quick and fast. Usual happy hours from 5 to 6pm. Gym was functional.No issues with noise as others have talked about - had a room on the 16th floor.If you are looking for consistent service in a well-located area - this is the hotel to be in. If you are looking to spend a lot of time in the hotel with the red carpet service, skip this hotel. I would chose this hotel again as Chicago was too beautiful to be spending that much time in hotels.

In fact, there is a theatre next door called Cadillac Palace. The room is a bit small but it was perfect for me as it made me feel very cosy and at home. The room is modern, very clean and the bed very comfortable. And in the evenings, I think between 5-6pm the hotel provides a free wine appreciation social drinks for the guests.

trip_advisor,"My wife got us tickets to see Phantom of the Opera at the (almost) next door Cadillac Palace Theater, and because of the great January rates, she decided we should stay downtown and make a weekend out of the trip into the city. ""Retro chic"" is the best way to describe the decor, and although the building is very old, it was very modern and comfortable. We got a King Single room, which was massive by Chicago hotel standards. Nice touches like plush bathrobes, glass cocktail and wine glasses, great shower, and super comfortable bed were very welcome. The HD TV was great, too, but it got little use. We had dinner at the connected 312 restaurant (very good!), and ordered a late carry-out flatbread from Encore - all easily charged to our room. Valet parking was pricey, but typical of 24 hours of parking in the Loop, and very efficient. Great weekend!",nan,nan,ta_s1368
trip_advisor,"I took my daughter and a friend to see Phantom of the Opera in Chicago. I had booked (or so I thought) a double queen room through Travelzoo, but when I arrived I was told I had no reservation and they were fully booked. When I showed the desk agent my paperwork, she pointed out that I had failed to agree to the terms and conditions, so my request did not process. However, they found me a single queen room for the same rate and offered us a rollaway bed. The rollaway wouldn't fit in the room, but the housekeeper who brought the bed suggested we lay the mattress on the floor. This worked out fine. The room was tiny but we had a good time, enjoyed pizza and salad in the adjoining restaurant, and were able to walk next door for the show and leave our coats and bags at the hotel. What could have been a disaster turned out to be a fun ""girlie"" weekend thanks to the accommodating and flexible staff at Hotel Allegro. Thank you for saving our weekend!",nan,nan,ta_s1369
trip_advisor,"I loved the hotel's modern decor and the contemporary feel. The bed was comfortable, the room spacious. However the bathroom is pretty small, I think you can shower and brush your teeth at the same time. We did not get out much due to a meeting but it is right next to the L which is good and bad. The good, is it would be easy to get around, the bad, you are right next to the L. The common areas are pretty. Some of the couches are prettier than are comfortable though. The evening wine/beer reception is a huge plus. Goose Island ales and passed pizza. Very nice touch!",nan,nan,ta_s1370
trip_advisor,"Although I was in Chicago for business and did not see a show, I wanted to with all the fantastic theaters all around. The Art Institute and lots of other sites and shops are within walking distance. This is the third Kimpton Hotel I've stayed in and they are wonderful: warm and welcoming service with lovely rooms. My Queen room was more compact that the double rooms I've stayed in, but I had all the amenities that I needed. My room was well furnished, the bed was very comfortable, and the bathroom compact but clean and well appointed. The 5-6pm beverage hour is terrific and a nice way to unwind after work. We ate at 312 one evening, the adjoining restaurant, and enjoyed the food and service there. Would definitely return to this hotel.",nan,nan,ta_s1371
trip_advisor,"My boyfriend and I stayed at the Hotel Allegro in November 2013 and we absolutely adored it! The room is beautiful and the location is extremely convenient! The hotel is newly renovated and is simply stunning. The staff was very courteous, friendly and helpful - they helped us pick a nearby restaurant on our first night! Since the hotel is located in the Theatre District, there are plenty of things to visit and see. We're both in our early 20's and it took us about 15-20 minutes to walk to the Magnificent Mile, 20 minutes to the Navy Pier, roughly 30 minutes to Millenium Park/Art Institute, and 45 minutes to Soldier Field. Taking a taxi is very cheap (we realized this on our last day) - it's around 5$ for a ride to Soldier Field from the hotel! The only downside is there is no parking within the hotel you have to park at a parking garage. I believe it is like this for many hotels in downtown Chicago though. We parked our car for 3 nights in the ""Lasalle Parking"", if I remember correctly, and the service was fantastic! I definitely recommend this hotel to everyone! It is in a great location, quiet, beautiful, and the beds were very comfortable. My one and only tip would be to visit the lobby desk regarding internet access! We thought we had to pay but if you sign up as one of their members you receive FREE wifi in your room!",nan,nan,ta_s1372
trip_advisor,"The rooms were very clean and well kempt, but not particularly interesting and smaller than many other Kimpton hotels that I've enjoyed.The staff was pleasant, but in other Kimpton experiences I've been blown away by how friendly and helpful the staff could be... not so this time. No complaint, just not impressed.One quibble: the elevator is unreasonably slow from the lobby. If you drop down a floor to the entrance, you can catch it easily, but at lobby I was waiting for over ten minutes each time I caught the elevator. That's a long time. The location is within the Loop and makes it easy to catch various L trains to get to wherever you might need to go. It's also a short walk from Milennium park, and from plenty of good restaurants. The lobby area is pleasant, bright, and comfortable.All in all, I'd go back but I would likely check out the Monaco first. It is a nice place, just not quite as nice as other Kimpton Hotels that I've enjoyed.Perks: free wine hour from 5-6, decent wine and beer. free coffee (very good coffee) in the morning in the lobby is much tastier than the typical in-room coffee pot (you can request a coffee pot, if you prefer). Join the inTouch program, it is free and gives you free wifi as well as a $10 coupon towards the minibar in your room, which is typically well-stocked.


Green Features: they claim to be focused on green practices, I didn't research it beyond their claims.",nan,nan,ta_s1374
trip_advisor,"I stayed here for a conference (the conference was held at the hotel as well). It was a nice hotel overall, but it was not the best Kimpton I've stayed in (the best were all in Washington, DC). It was a renovated older hotel and that seemed pretty apparent. The rooms were smaller than other Kimptons i've stayed in and I had terrible allergies the whole time (as did a few other conference attendees), so I think they may not have done a thorough flush or renovation of the air ducts. The temperature was also hard to get right (it was either freezing or boiling) and the window was painted shut, so I had no possibility for fresh air.The breakout rooms for the conference were odd -- ours was too big and another one was double booked. The main ballroom is right next to the train tracks, so you do hear a lot of noise over speakers when a train goes by. Also, the walls in the bedrooms are really thin. I heard a very long conversation my neighbor was having on the phone until late at night.Those are the negatives. There were also plenty of positives. The lobby was great - lots of comfortable seating for networking with high ceilings and a nice atmosphere (decorated to Kimpton standards). The customer service was top notch. On checking out, I mentioned that I missed my baby, and they gave me a bag of Kimpton Kids goodies, which was a nice touch. I love the InTouch members benefits of a $10 credit from the mini-bar (I had a massive bottle of water, which clocked in on the price sheet at over $6, so that was a nice benefit--although that's a benefit for members at all Kimpton hotels). The free yoga mat (also a Kimpton-wide perk) was nice, but the room was very small and so it was hard to find space to do yoga! The toiletries were very nice quality. The location is really fantastic. It's a 1.5 blocks from the El (I took the El from Midway and they're both on the orange line, so this was a big bonus). Plus easy to walk to lots of locations around downtown Chicago from the hotel. They also stored something for me in the freezer, which was nice.I give it very high marks for service and location. I only knock of a rating for the air quality and smallness of the rooms compared to other Kimptons I've stayed in.",nan,nan,ta_s1375
trip_advisor,"Visited downtown Chicago with my adult daughter for the weekend. Booked the Hotel Allegro and we were pleased. When we arrived, they had a free wine hour which we were not expecting. What a treat - it started the weekend out the right way. The front desk staff was very friendly and helpful. We were extremely happy with the convenient location to the Amtrak Station and to what we had wanted to do. In the morning they served coffee and tea with a few fun fixings. They were very accommodating to store our luggage after check out time so we could go around town without hauling our luggage around. The bathroom was small but was not a problem for a short stay. Would stay there again when visiting Chicago.",nan,nan,ta_s1376
trip_advisor,"The Allegro is my new home-away-from-home. I'm in Chicago frequently for business, and work just a few blocks from the hotel. Only drawback: Their standard room is somewhat small. But anyone familiar with the Kimpton Hotels brand knows they do their best to make up for it, particularly among frequent customers. Decor throughout the hotel is cool and quirky, and the beds are super comfortable. Rooms are also functional with a big desk with lots of plugs available. Loyalty club members get $10 credit towards mini bar purchases (or a cocktail in the hotel bar) on every stay plus free wifi. There's a wine hour every day where the hotel serves free wine and beer to guests, and a coffee bar every morning.Plus there are yoga mats in every room, free bike rentals and tons of loungey, comfortable places to sit.Finally, there's a restaurant on the first floor, as well as a Starbucks. Makes it easy to grab and go.Overall, a comfortable place to go",nan,nan,ta_s1377
trip_advisor,"THE GOOD:One thing is certain, the service in this hotel is excellent! The check in process was super quick, the woman at the desk offered several suggestions to improve my stay, and they responded so quickly to my request for a coffee maker in the room that they almost beat me to the hotel room door. (In addition to the coffee maker, they brought several K-cup options, and every item one might possibly need to enjoy coffee or tea.) The entire hotel was spotless, including the room. It was easy to see that the cleaning staff take exceptional pride in their work. There is a complimentary wine gathering at 5:00 pm each day, with healthy servings of wine offered by friendly servers. There were no requests unanswered, and all were greeted with smiles and genuine offers to help!The hotel is smack in the middle of downtown. The location offers live entertainment, coffee shops, great dining at just about any price point, and multiple shopping spots to be had within a short walk.THE BAD:The rooms are miniscule! The bathroom is super small (think closet), with a narrow, tiny counter that ensures that getting ready is an absolute pain. The rooms have NO sound proofing between them, making for embarrassing evenings listening to people in the next room talking and/or doing other things that really should not be shared with neighbors. There is also NO sound proofing between the walls of adjacent room bathrooms, which needs no further explanation. Ick! All hallway noise comes into the room as well, so one can give up on getting any sleep until the entire hotel floor chooses to go to bed for the night.If only one could transplant the amazing staff into a larger, soundproofed hotel in that exact same spot!",nan,nan,ta_s1378
trip_advisor,"I had a great time at the Allegro during a work trip in downtown Chicago. I was only there for exactly 24 hours, but during that time I had an awesome experience.Kimpton Hotels does a great job keep a clean house and always having a fabulous, fun and quirky decor. Every square inch of this place is spotless! My room, while rather small, was clean, smartly decorated and so comfortable. This was one of the best sleeps I've had on a work trip, hands down.All of the staff from front desk, to room service are so happy and willing to help. That goes a long way.My only gripes are the $60 valet charge to wait 30 minutes for the car and the size of the bathroom. The valet service made me late for a flight, I could have used that time! My rooms bath was so small, you could use the shower, toilet and sink at once.Overall, I will totally return.",nan,nan,ta_s1379
trip_advisor,"Great location in the middle of downtown, within reach to City Hall, State Daley Plaza, Dyvvy Bikes, the Washington Wells CTA Orange Line Station (one of the three stations in the Loop with elevators), and many theaters. There is a Starbucks on the first floor, and a CVS pharmacy within a block. Our family was greeted with a bag full of goodies for our children (the lighted yo-yos were a great hit!), and check in was pretty fast. Just be aware: The lobby is in the second floor, so if you don't feel like taking their beautiful staircase up to the lobby, you'll need to wait for a while for an available elevator. We were assigned room 725, which is handicap accessible. We had not requested that type of room, but we were fine with it, because the room and bathroom were very spacious. Beds were very comfy, but wished our pillows were a bit firmer. The flooring in the bathroom needs to be revisited, because a large pool of water kept being form in the middle of the bathroom after each shower. Internet connection in the room was fast. Check out was fast, except for the wait for an elevator; it was early Sunday morning, and we had been waiting in line for over 15 minutes, when finally one of the cleaning staff was kind to show us the service elevator.",nan,nan,ta_s1380
trip_advisor,"Stayed here for the weekend, and wasn't blown away. Landed a room on Hotwire for $200 a night, and I was a bit disappointed when I saw the room - it was rather small and underwhelming. Elevators took forever - the shortest wait to go downstairs was just under 5 minutes.That being said, everything was clean, all of the amenities one would expect were there, and they had a nice local beer and wine event with complementary beverages the first night we were there. Location is prime - right by the loop and the main shopping district.Staff was lovely - in short, they tried, but still couldn't reconcile the fact that I didn't get much of a room for the price we paid.",nan,nan,ta_s1381
trip_advisor,"We were here attending a conference and were given a corner room. The bed was comfy and the room large. Complementary umbrella, slipper, yoga mat and robes in the room. Also had a small iron and board. The check in is one floor up from street level and each evening has a hosted wine and beer reception with one passed appy based on the day. Starbucks off the street levbel door and a great little bar on the other side which made getting a night cap super easy. The gym on the 5th ? floor is functional and they have complimentary headphones in case your forget. Nice touch.It is an older building and we were on the 10th floor and could see and hear the train when it passed. Great location, easy to public transit which made getting around the city a breeze. The only reason it does not get a 5 is that it did not exceed my expectation, but it certainly met them.",nan,nan,ta_s1382
trip_advisor,"Dear Kimpton brass: About the Allegro...it needs updating. It's not a bad hotel at all -- we had a decent five-day stay there -- but it's shabby around the edges. We were wowed by your Monaco in Denver, enjoyed your Surfcomber in Miami Beach, but let down by the ordinariness of the Allegro in Chicago. Will the Epic in Miami be what we expect from Kimpton? We're pondering it. Anyhow, back to the Allegro: Good staff, convenient Loop location, no noise on the 14th floor (no view either, but that's tolerable in a downtown hotel). We didn't leave complaining or in a bad mood -- even with the minuscule closet or when the bathroom door knob fell off -- but we didn't depart inspired to come back. Send us a note when you get the Allegro spiffed up. Oh, by the way, a kudo: Your next-door 312 Restaurant was the highlight of our stay. See our separate review on that.",nan,nan,ta_s1383

My entire family stayed at the hotel for two nights on the occasion of my 2nd daughter's, second marriage. The wedding, wedding dinner/dance and goodbye breakfast were all hosted by the hotel. Every one of the hotel staff we came in contact with was friendly and completely service oriented. It was almost impossible to believe that a commercial enterprise like this hotel could be staffed by such nice, friendly folks. And the meals . . . . . outstanding! The wedding dinner was as good as any fine restaurant might serve . . . . . delicious, and served with style and grace. The wedding was conducted in the beautiful hotel ballroom and was conducted perfectly to the enjoyment of all, especially the bride and groom! The entire event made for wonderful picture taking opportunities and lasting memories. Very nicely done. Everyone's room was also comfortable, nicely decorated and pleasing to stay in.Coupled with the outstanding location in the middle of the theater district, a wonderful overall experience.",nan,nan,ta_s1385
trip_advisor,"What I liked the most about the Kimpton Allegro was the location. It was in the middle of the Theater district but it did not feel crowded or touristy. All main locations were within walking distance and there was a metro 5 minutes away from the hotel. The rooms are nicely decorated and we loved the Bigelow toilletries. The staff was very friendly and the concierge, Anthony gave us a great recommendation for dinner, EPIC. I also liked the fact the rooms have free wi-fi with the inTouch membership. Overall a great experience.

trip_advisor,"I never really understood the value proposition of Kimpton Hotels. I am guessing ""cheap"" would nail it, as these properties are indeed reasonnably priced for well located urban properties. The one in Cambridge Mass was acceptable, and i stayed there many times despite its shortcomings. The Allegro in Chicago is a notch down. The location in the Loop is good. Service is friendly. But the decor and attention to detail are not to my taste. Bordering on the 'design for the uneducated' category, it is a mix of old style American middle class luxury cues (textured wall papier, gold ribbons and heavy cushions...) all mixed in with cheap imitations of contemporary furniture. As a result, we have none of the confort or cosines of a Stark or Garcia, and none of the sobriety of an Eames or Puttman. Attention to detail is weird too. My huge suite has a real bathtub (nice for a change in a us hotel), but no shelf space and no toothbrush glasses. Breakfast was your usual industrial stuff, but no salt or pepper. Minibar is locked but the key doesn't work. Am I supposed to call housekeeping every time to get this fixed? Rooms are somewhat noisy, I am listening to my neighbour's telephone conversation as we speak. All in all a decent place for the cost conscious, but definitely not the experience it overtrades as.",nan,nan,ta_s1388
trip_advisor,"My girlfriend and I stayed here for four nights in August 2013. I read loads of reviews on Tripadvisor before opting for the Allegro and I'm really glad I did. The free wine reception every evening was an added bonus (and one of the things that swung it for me - I thought a hotel that gave you free booze couldn't be all bad), but it was perfect in so many ways. Our room was lovely and really quiet (I emailed ahead of our arrival and asked for something not too many floors up and they were only too happy to oblige), the breakfast every morning in 312 was a great way to set us up for the day, and the location was great - walking distance to Millennium Park and the Magnificent Mile.It was a bit quiet at night, but I think that's just Chicago. It seems the nightlife might be reserved for the suburbs. A great hotel, I'd recommend it highly.",nan,nan,ta_s1389
trip_advisor,"We took advantage of the ""All Inclusive"" special we found on the hotel website. It included free valet parking and a dining credit for both days we stayed. While this is obviously an older Hotel that has been furnished to look new and modern, it was still quite nice. While hotel restaurants can be hit and miss, we thought 312 was a HIT. Excellent breakfast and dinner we had. The rooms are fine. Bathroom was very tight, but who cares? I'm not staying at the hotel to hang out in the bathroom. Again, old Hotel. Didnt eat from the mini-bar, but I did use the fridge for my personal beers. The location is a few blocks further away from the main action of Michigan Ave, but I think it's reflected in the slightly lower prices. Hotel staff was not snotty like another fancy Chicago hotel we stayed at. Plus you can't beat the free Happy hour at 5pm. Couple beers in the hotel lobby before dinner. Perfect!",nan,nan,ta_s1390
trip_advisor,"I have long favored Kimpton hotels, and on this visit their superiority in their class was once again confirmed for me. When I arrived early -- VERY early, like 9 a.m. -- I was told that there was actually a room available for me. But when I went to the room, I discovered it had not, in fact, been made up. I returned to the lobby and the staff apologized, but there was no other room to offer me. I was not overly put out -- I was six hours early for check-in, after all. Later that evening, when I returned from dinner, there was a lovely plate of cheese and accompaniments and a full bottle of red wine waiting with a handwritten note apologizing for the inconvenience at check in! Whatever very slight exasperation I might have felt from my experience that morning was more than erased, and my loyalty to the chain was strengthened.(Additionally, my room was clean and lovely, and the Kimpton In Touch perks were appreciated as always.)Highly recommend!",nan,nan,ta_s1391

(They even have a free wine 'get together' in the lobby from 5-6)The room was very good and in addition to the usual mini bar they had a selection of 'missed items' i.e. toothpaste,shoe polish,tooth brush and even a condom for those unplanned meetings!!(I love America!!)The restaurant was good but a little pricey but then it is the city centre.Check out the old,and unfortunately not used internal mail system, next to all the lifts that used to 'deposit' your mail into the box on the ground floor!We enjoyed our stay at the Allegro and will return.",nan,nan,ta_s1392

The hotel restaurant is very good, with again excellent service. The hotel is well located for the theatre district and main attractions.We have stayed in Kimptons before and prefer concierge to be dressed in formal uniform so they are easily recognisable as staff. The communal areas are exceptional, comfy chairs with quirky decor.

trip_advisor,"I got this hotel through Priceline and for the price I paid, it was ok. But at advertised rates, I don't think it's worth it and it should not be 4*I had a standard queen room that was on the small side, but not as small as some of the reviews made it out to be. It was spacious enough for 2 people to move around without any issues. The bed was very good but the closet was very small and there was no in room coffee.

The location is excellent as it is easily accessed from the airport via the subway's 'blue line' and most of the cities attractions such as the Willis Tower, Magnificent Mile, Chicago River and many others are within easy walking distance. You can also find every colour of subway line with 3 to 4 blocks so even further away attractions are easily accessed. The hotel itself, was clean, well maintained and the staff were very friendly.

trip_advisor,"I was recently on a business trip to Chicago and was pleasantly surprised with everything the Allegro had to offer. When I entered the ground level I immediately saw a bunch of fun bikes off to the right, next to the Starbucks entrance. In the elevator I saw a poster that indicated I could borrow the bike to explore the city or get to my meeting. I inquired about it at checkin and was happy to find it was free! I checked in at 3pm, threw my stuff down in my room and was exploring the city on a beach cruiser-style bike by 3:15. I rode along the waterfront, the city bike trails, etc. and enjoyed the beautiful weather in a fun way.My overall stay at the Allegro was great. They hold an evening happy hour of free wine from 5-6pm. The lobby is spacious and comfortable and found that many guests enjoyed socializing with other guests during the wine hour. It made me feel more at home given this open, inviting environment.The location was great - within walking distance to everything I needed and cabs were readily available when necessary. The staff was professional, friendly and helpful and I loved having a Starbucks in the base of the building. I would definitely stay here again.",nan,nan,ta_s1398
trip_advisor,"Very much a boutique hotel with smaller space, but perfectly suited for our needs. The staff was incredibly helpful, friendly and professional. The location was wonderful with much of what we wanted to do within walking or a short cab ride's distance. I simply adore that they accept pets and that you're not limited to just one. This is a very rare amenity. The fitness room was also a nice surprise - very clean and well maintained with plenty of equipment, weights, etc. This area also has a water cooler, which was much appreciated.",nan,nan,ta_s1399

My husband and I, along with our 9 month old son stayed here over the 4th of July weekend and it was better than I could have expected. The staff was very helpful and courteous and made us feel welcome, especially with a complimentary upgrade to a suite. Having a separate room for our baby to sleep in was great and meant we weren't going to spend our evening hunkered in the bathroom. The staff at 312 was also very kind and attentive to us, and the location can't be beat for a Chicago get away. I've recommended this hotel already and have another stay booked coming up. This is what a boutique hotel should be like!",nan,nan,ta_s1400

Overall, this was a great business stay and I would recommend for another quick visit.",nan,nan,ta_s1401

There were no hanging closets, no irons, no coffee makers in the rooms and the work space is not great. I have stayed before fun for pleasure travel. They allow dogs and it has cool decor and is more 'hipster' than a corporate franchise so not great for a work stay. If you are looking for a more relaxed stay, this is the place",nan,nan,ta_s1402

My room was very modern and comfortable,and the price I paid for my stay on the Hotel web was a great deal for such a nice Hotel and location. I enjoyed my stay so much my only regret was I didnt book an extra night at the Allegro.

trip_advisor,"We arrived an hour prior to check in and the man at the check in desk was very nice, we told him we wanted to get information on a boat tour and he said the concierge would help us but there was nobody at the concierge desk at the time so after checking in we waited a bit and then decided to go to the room, unpack, and then talk to the concierge. We reserved a room with a king size bed but our room had a queen size bed, we decided to just stay in the room because we were only staying one night. After unpacking we went back down to the lobby to talk to the concierge, there still wasn't anyone at the desk so we sat and waited, and waited, and waited. The concierge never came. Maybe they should put a sign on the desk if the concierge is going to be gone for longer than 30 minutes. After spending a few hours in the city we got back to the hotel at about 5:15, just in time for the wine hour. The free wine and few passed apps were very nice, the only problem was the garbage laying around. We sat in chairs next to a small table, the table had a few wrappers, used napkins, coffee cup and water bottle on it and we looked around for a garbage can to throw the items in but couldn't find one. Later in the evening when we got back to our room we were going to order something from room service but they didn't have a room service menu. The book that has info on the hotel was missing a few pages and it referenced the feed me book for the room service menu but there wasn't one in the room. They also didn't have a list of what the items in the mini bar cost, we wanted some water but didn't want to have one if they were going to charge us $20. We've stayed at another Kimpton hotel in Chicago and that was a much better experience. We won't be staying here again.",nan,nan,ta_s1404
trip_advisor,"My husband and I stayed here for eight nights when he was in Chicago on business. One of the best features of this hotel is the location. It's right in the Loop, about a twenty minute-walk to some of Chicago's most popular attractions such as Millennium Park, the Chicago Institute of Art, and the Mag Mile. If you enjoy walking but don't want to be too far away from the attractions, this location is ideal. It's also about a 5-minute walk to a couple of Metra stops to get you to Wrigley Field and other interesting places.If you like quirky, funky, unique design, you'll probably appreciate the decor in the lobby and rooms. It wasn't quite my taste, but it was definitely different. Another good thing about this hotel was the complimentary coffee and tea from 6-10 a.m. Although a continental breakfast would have been nicer, it was better than being completely on your own first thing in the morning. The gym was basic but had all of the equipment I needed for cardio workouts and strength training. The front desk staff were alright, polite but not overly helpful. My biggest complaint about this hotel was that the rooms were very small. For the price, I expected a bit more space. Admittedly, if I had a shorter stay, this probably wouldn't have bothered me as much. Also, the rooms were out-dated; the black and white circle wallpaper made me feel like I was back in the seventies.",nan,nan,ta_s1405
trip_advisor,"I stayed at the Allegro on business and selected it because of the close proximity to the work site. I was not disappointed. The hotel is close to the El, making it easy to take the train from the airport. I was greeting by very friendly staff who remained very helpful throughout our stay. The rooms were small (typical for a city hotel) but very nicely appointed. Lots of outlets and comfortable workspace. I do like the the Kimpton happy hour. They had a nice selection of wine and sangria plus some appetizers. It's a good way to meet other travelers. I would highly recommend the Allegro.


Green Features: The hotel has in-room recycling and a towel reuse program.",nan,nan,ta_s1406
trip_advisor,"These rooms are small. I mean tiny. The main part of my room was just 10 by 15 feet. The closet was less than two feet square and the bathroom didn't even have an enclosed vanity, some of the toiletries were stored on a shelf under the sink.Small.The staff was friendly and the evening complimentary adult beverages were a nice touch.Parking was $56 per night (high even by Chicago standards) and they charged a colleague of mine $1.75 to print a boarding pass for his return flight. So while the sticker price is pretty low, they make some of that up by nickeling and diming.If you're on a budget, this place will work, but I think you can do better.",nan,nan,ta_s1407
trip_advisor,"I stayed at this hotel for 2 nights for a work meeting. I thought it was just OK. Kimptons try too hard for my taste -- the decor is a little too trendy. The rooms in this hotel were tiny, the smallest I've seen outside of NYC. That was what I liked the least. The bathroom sink was so tiny, when I washed my hands, water was splashed on my legs. I shower and night and usually get my hair wet in the morning (in order to style it), and my head would not fit under the spigot of the sink. The shower, however, was nice and had good water pressure.The gym was also small but had what I needed. The best part of the hotel was its location. As others have said -- in the theater district and close to buses and trains. Of course, that means I could hear the trains going by at night. I didn't have great sleep quality.I wouldn't rush to stay here again but would if the price was right.",nan,nan,ta_s1408
trip_advisor,"Absolutely fantastic location (inside the Loop), close to shopping, Willis Tower, Millenium Park and the general downtown. Rooms are seen bigger, however, comfertable and spacious beds. We got breakfast included, and it was served in the restaurant located next to the hotel. Staff was nice and helpful (both receptionists and concierge). The hotel has a great atmosphere and a very unique style. Even though the building is old and the hotel definitely has been renovated, they've managed to preserve the special feeling and touch this hotel has got.In the morning complementary coffee and tea are served and for a couple of hours each afternoon sangria and wine is served for free during happy hour. (And the sangria is great, too!).I would recommend this hotel and when I return to Chicago, this hotel will hopefully be where I'll stay!",nan,nan,ta_s1409
trip_advisor,"This was a great place to be. The location is wonderful...right by the L stop we needed, in the heart of the theatre district, and very close to the shops on State. Hotel staff was exceptionally friendly. Our room was quite spacious. Perhaps we were an exception since I've read a lot of ""small room"" reviews here. We had a room at the very end of the hall on the top floor, and maybe that contributed to it. I don't know, but we had a bunch of space. Noise was not an issue at all. Loved the robes that are provided. The bathroom is very small, which was the only real annoyance we had since we had to get ready for a dinner out, and could only go in one at a time to do so, and is the only reason why I am giving this four stars. The wine reception was great. They offered wine, beer, and sangria. We opted for the sangria, which was light, refreshing, and absolutely delicious. There was also a chef preparing small plates of pasta, which was very good as well. Our sleep was very restful, and check out was a breeze. Since we planned on spending the day downtown after check out, we asked if they could hold our bag, and they were very accommodating. Though I wish the bathroom was bigger, our stay was absolutely wonderful and I would not hesitate to stay here again.",nan,nan,ta_s1410
trip_advisor,"We just commpleted a 3-day stay and were very satisifed. For starters, we got an excellent rate (via Hotwire) for a hotel that was comfy and extremely well located (near every subway line, near the theaters). The beds and pillows were confortable and wi-fi was free if you joined the hotel's ""club,"" (which was free to do). They had lots of nice little things: $10 of complimentary things form the (overpriced) inroom stash of snacks; nice shower robes (and a yoga mat!), 5 p.m. free wine. A minor negative: There was no coffee pot in the room, but free coffee in the lobby. (I believe one can ask for a coffee pot, but we didn't.) Our room was a good size with a spacious bathroom. Mattress was very comfortable. We didn't encounter too much noise.",nan,nan,ta_s1411
trip_advisor,"Booked blindly via Hotwire and wasn't sure what to expect. Decor was very unique and fun. Everything was clean. The free wine/beer from 5-6 was also great! The customer service was also friendly. I requested a king sized bed away from the L-train at check-in and they were more than accommodating. I noticed a lot of complaints about the rooms being small. They were small, it's a boutique hotel in the middle of the city. It was totally doable, and if you plan on spending most of your time around the city it really doesn't matter. My only complaint was that the walls were pretty thin. If you are a light sleeper, or worried about others hearing your conversations this could be annoying. All in all, I would recommend this hotel to others.",nan,nan,ta_s1412
trip_advisor,"This hotel is situated within the Loop which makes it a perfect central location to explore from. The hotel is very clean and nicely decorated and all staff we came across were friendly and very helpful. The rooms are on the slender size but we had plenty of room for us and the suitcases. We were on a Bed and Breakfast deal, which was fine for us but the breakfast was limited. It consisted of Coffee, fruit juice, cup of fruit and then a choice of toast/English muffin/Croissant. I would definitely come back to this hotel once we return to Chicago.",nan,nan,ta_s1413
trip_advisor,"Stayed here for a quick one night business trip to Chicago...This was a great hotel and I would have no hesitation in staying here on a future trip. The beds were super comfortable, and the rooms clean and contemporary. Katie at front desk was really friendly and a pleasure to deal with after a long flight. Definitely join the kimpton loyalty club too as it gets you a whole bunch of little extra's. Look forward to going back soon!",nan,nan,ta_s1414
trip_advisor,"Our hotel room was ready upon our arrival. We arrived about an hour early, and there were no problems checking in. Our room was on the 8th floor. It was a smaller room but very clean. The decor was nice. One night there was a party in the room next door. People were singing, loud music, and smoking weed. I called the front desk, and they sent security up. All of the noise stopped. Other than that minor issue, we had absolutely no problems with this hotel. It's in a great location (theater district).",nan,nan,ta_s1415
trip_advisor,"We loved the decor and got several decorating ideas from our room! Even though the rooms are on the smaller side, we had a baby, stroller AND a pack n play (which they provided including sheet!!) and were totally comfortable. There are TWO closets to hang your clothes in. The service was perfect and location was super close to all public transportation. There is a freshii.com a block away for you healthy eaters. Become a Kimpton member and get free wifi and $10 out of the minibar!! Will definitely stay here again!!",nan,nan,ta_s1416
trip_advisor,"I have stayed here before. The public spaces and rooms are beautifully designed. The rooms are small but very well planned. The decor and appointments are A+. The staff is very nice. Bedding is nice. Amenities include the usual and bath robes, socks in the closet. There are no coffee makers in the room. You need to go downstairs in the morning for you complimentary cup.Unfortunately on this 5 night trip I had noisy room neighbors on and off. Make sure to have ear plugs just in case. Upon learning of the noise, I was delivered ear plugs and chocolates by the hotel. This certainly is a nice service jest urge.Also, the mattress in my room should have been replaced (or turned around/over) a long time ago. I didn't think to report this until I checked out. So, perhaps if you experience the same, report it. You will sleep better. The mattress was well dented on one side, by the telephone, as if a heavy person had been sleeping in that exact spot for a long time. (What I've learned is this must be the side where most people sleep.)",nan,nan,ta_s1417
trip_advisor,"Stayed here with some friends for a weekend stay in one of the suites with king bed and separate living room. The room was great - spacious, well designed. Staff was friendly. Location is good right in the Loop though it is only 1 block from the L (elevated subway) which isn't particularly scenic and can get a little loud but it's certainly convenient getting to/from the airport. Overall a good hotel - would recommend!",nan,nan,ta_s1418
trip_advisor,"Thoroughly enjoyed the spacious suite with my daughter. Plenty of room in bathroom to get ready for the evening event, It was fun to relax, read and watch the traffic below on the streets. Very nice ammenities.

trip_advisor,"Great location - just across the river on State/ a block and 1/2 from the Red/Orange/Brown line and 2 blocks from the Blue. The rooms are large, clean, on the modern side and come with free wifi. The staff are friendly and helpful. Your stay comes with a complimentary continental breakfast - located on every floor! And when I say continental I mean a full spread of coffee, juices, donuts, muffins, bagels, pastries, cheeses, cereal, fresh fruit, yogurt, and so much more. Probably the best breakfast continental breakfast I've ever experienced. And the fact that it's steps from your door, means you can head out in your robe. Also included is a nightly HH on the 6th floor where you're treated to a cocktail, glass of wine or beer - all of which are ""top shelf"" choices.",nan,nan,ta_s1420
trip_advisor,"I stayed at the Kinzie in the Summer of 2014, and have never had such fantastic service and welcoming staff. The location of the hotel is perfect, right in the heart of the action and steps away from the river. The staff was extremely pleasant and helpful and the hotel itself is beautiful. I would recommend the Kinzie hotel to anyone planning on travelling to Chicago. I plan on staying here upon my next visit.",nan,nan,ta_s1421
trip_advisor,"My husband and I traveled from Dallas to Chicago for a quick weekend getaway. We chose this hotel primarily for it's excellent location (we walked everywhere we went while in Chicago), the amazing prices, and the included breakfast! When we arrived early from our morning flight, they quickly helped us get checked in, stored our luggage, and called my cell as soon as our room was ready. All of the staff was so friendly and everyone was always smiling. There was always someone to greet you at the door.We had a fantastic room, a king corner room on the 6th floor. We enjoyed views of the Trump tower and the Wrigley building. The bed was comfortable, room was clean, and we were right by the lounge area. We took advantage of the breakfast each morning and the nightly happy hour.After we found out our flight back to Dallas was going to be cancelled due to the crazy snowstorm we talked with Monica and she was so helpful in getting us booked for a 3rd night. It was quick to walk anywhere we wanted - the lounge on top of the John Hancock building, Magnificent Mile, Art Institute, Millenium Park, etc. We also enjoyed the proximity of many restaurants - Harry Caray's, Bavette's Bar & Beoff, Frontera Grill, and Eataly to name a few! We will certainly be back to this hotel again and look forward to another great trip to Chicago!",nan,nan,ta_s1422
trip_advisor,"I stay here when it was the Almafi, now remodeled and updated to a very modern/contemporary design. The rooms are very nice, bathrooms modern and clean. Very comfortable beds. The evening happy hour was quite nice. One drink ticket, but the cost for an extra drink was very reasonable. Also a nice continental breakfast served on each floor by the elevators. Staff was very nice and helpful. Overall a very good deal for central Chicago",nan,nan,ta_s1423
trip_advisor,"Kinzie hotel is an excellent value hotel. The rooms are clean and confortable, they use their space very efficiently. The hotel has a great location, within walking distance of the miracle mile and some other great places in Chicago. They offer some tokens for free drinks at the bar which would provide some warmth before heading out in to the cold downtown streets however this should not be seen as a destination more as the first step towards a night out. Great little hotel that does its job right and does not pretend to be more than it is.",nan,nan,ta_s1424
trip_advisor,"We have stayed at the Kinzie several times when it was the Amalfi...first time since new ownership and remodeled...love the decor of the rooms...very modern and comfortable...bed was first class...previously the 'happy hour' was unlimited complimentary drinks but now it's only one per person so new ownership has become more 'stingy'...while I don't expect two hours of freebies the cutback to one only was disappointing..and we arrive for only the last hour and the 'munchies' were gone...if they advertise 'food and drink' til 8 pm they should not run out at 7:15...other than that we enjoy the new renovations...depending upon how the rates compare to other comparable River North lodging properties, we'll return if remain competitive",nan,nan,ta_s1426
trip_advisor,This was my first time staying at this hotel as I usually stay at Embassy Suites when I'm in Chicago. I must say that everything about the hotel was good. All the staff was very welcoming. When I had go call down to the front desk because there was a problem with the heat; the technician was at the room within 15 minutes and fixed the probkem. The breakfast was nice with a good selection as well as the managers reception every evening. I liked the fact that it lasts a few hours so that you don't feel rushed and that you have to get there rite away. You can definitely tell that the managers make customer service apart of the employees training. I would definitely come back again.,nan,nan,ta_s1427
trip_advisor,"We have stayed at this hotel several times over the past 4 years and keep coming back, despite the change in ownership and identity.We first stayed at the Kinzie when it was called the Amalfi, and were overwhelmed by the service and extra amenities, like the ""manager's reception"" which featured an open bar with appetizers for several hours each evening, a nice breakfast options on each floor, robes, etc.The hotel has since scaled back the open ""open bar"" manager's reception to an offering of one free drink per night, per guest, controlled by tokens given to guests upon check-in. I can understand the need for this change, because the open bar option was abused by guests and by persons not even staying at the hotel.The service level at the Kinzie seems to have improved, the decor updated, and the breakfast options remain the same. The only significant change seems to be to the previous very liberal ""free drinks"" policy during the evening reception.If you decide to stay, request an upper level room, on the side of the hotel off Kinzie Street. Although you will not have a view, it will be a bit quieter, as Kinzie can be very active throughout the night.",nan,nan,ta_s1428
trip_advisor,"This was our first trip back since the hotel changed from Amalfi to Kinzie. The remodels are gorgeous; love the modern colors. We were treated so kindly by the staff - Jared and Jerry welcomed us warmly, and got us checked in quickly. They gave us good advice on dining at the Tortoise Club (yummy!). Julian was there in the morning and was exceptionally friendly and helpful as well. Great staff and atmosphere. Oh, and make sure you check in in time for happy hour!",nan,nan,ta_s1429
trip_advisor,"We really liked this place. There are a whole lot of little things that add up to making this a great experience. There are complimentary drinks every evening with great little snacks and nibblies. Other reviewers commented on the buffet breakfast available neat the elevators on each floor. It really was a treat to just sneak out in pyjamas and bathrobes (also complimentary), fill up a tray and retreat back to your room to relax and enjoy the breakfast. Add in cookies and hot chocolate in the lobby, extra public washrooms on some of the floors, chairs to sit on at check-in (who likes standing after a long trip?).All the staff here are very professional and attentive. Whenever we had a question we were greeted with smiles and all the advice and suggestions we got was spot-on to our needs.Location is perfect. Easy to walk to North Michigan, the River, the area south of the River, Macy's, etc.. Also great restaurants very close, including Sienna Tavern, Davanti Enoteca and many others. There's also an Einstein Brothers Bagel place on the next block in case you want something more substantial for breakfast.My only (small) suggestion would be to maybe upgrade the mattresses. In our room the mattress seemed to sag slightly a bit at the edge of the bed. This may be a personal taste - I like a hard mattress. Again, this is a very minor point and does not take away from this fabulous hotel.",nan,nan,ta_s1430
trip_advisor,this hotel is in a great location. We were able to walk to most of our events. It is small and friendly. The room was very clean and the bed had comfy linens. We did a ton of walking a took a great nap thinking the bed was really nice. However the next morning we both felt different. It wasn't bad just not as comfy as we thought after a full night. They offer breakfast but when we got there it had been raided and it wasn't replenished very fast so we ate elsewhere. They did give out free drink tokens which was nice. We ate lunch at Sienna Tavern. Omg yummy. Go there!! We would consider staying at the hotel again but won't make it a mission.,nan,nan,ta_s1431
trip_advisor,"The Kinzie hotel was brilliant, the service and check in was quick, polite and efficient. The room we had was excellent, it was large and had a comfortable bed, window seat, and all the room amenities were great. The Kinzie also have a social every evening from 6-8pm where they have snacks and free beverages - including alcohol. The room was spotless and all the staff were really on their A game - polite and really helpful. I highly recommend this hotel. Although the hotel isn't directly off Magnificent Mile, it's only a few blocks away and is very close to all Chicago's main sites. The only negative was the room service food which wasn't great but with plenty of restaurant choice in Chicago and close by to the hotel that shouldn't put you off staying here.",nan,nan,ta_s1432
trip_advisor,"First things first--the hotel is in a fantastic location in the city. One can easily walk to Michigan Avenue shops, State street shops, the loop, Millenium Park, etc. The River North area is full of wonderful restaurants and bars. We compared prices of lots of hotels in the city and decided on the Kinzie because it wasn't a chain hotel. Continental breakfast was wonderfully presented on each floor, and our reservation came with two free drinks during happy hour. The rooms were beautifully decorated and nicely sized. The real surprise for us was the level of service. Having stayed in many hotels downtown, this was by far the best service I have ever seen. Zuhair helped us with our luggage, and actively engaged my seven year old son. The valet, whose name I didn't catch, went above and beyond to help us get our car when we had problems with our parking arrangements through Spot Hero. Really what made me so happy was everyone we came into contact with treated my son so well. Sometimes establishments don't have the ""time"" for children. I will recommend this hotel and will definitely stay here again. Thank you for your genuine service.",nan,nan,ta_s1433
trip_advisor,"We stayed here just before Thanksgiving weekend, the weather was cold and windy. The hotel was nice and warm. The Kizie is a great place to stay. We had a corner king which had plenty of room, closet space and good desk space. Bed was comfy and bath was clean and well appointed. We did have breakfast as it was continental style held at the elevator entrance on each floor. If I had any complaint it was that the breakfast was not refilled often enough. Rising at 8 am for breakfast and it was already half empty. We found the hotel right in the middle of many restuarants with lots of choices for any time of the day. Shopping was a bit of a walk, but taxi's are plentiful and not very expensive. I would stay here again and recommend it to anyone look for a good stay at a good price.",nan,nan,ta_s1434
trip_advisor,"We had my bachelorette in Chicago, where all 14 of us were from out of town. We chose to stay with Kinzie as it looked like a great deal for a boutique hotel in downtown. It was much much much better than we expected! They checked us all in at the same time, no mix ups, no issues. Gave us cold water bottles right when we got in and every time after when we were stepping out of the hotel, took our bags to our rooms. The rooms were beautiful, clean and good enough room, very unique for sure. Always smiling, always helpful, always interacted with us. They location was great, we were walking distance to everything, dinner spots, shopping, clubs, Lincoln park, John Hannock center and much more. I would definitely stay here again and recommend it to anyone traveling to Chicago looking for a place to stay downtown.",nan,nan,ta_s1435
trip_advisor,"Every Thanksgiving, our family picks a downtown hotel to spend a few nights, do a little shopping and basically enjoy each other's company, since we live in 5 different states and only see each other once a year. We have stayed in 8 other downtown hotels, and the Kinzie has jumped to the top of our list as our favorite. From the continental breakfast enjoyed in your jammies, to the impeccable professionalism and friendliness of every member of the staff, everything was top notch. We can't wait to come back next year!",nan,nan,ta_s1436
trip_advisor,"We had a flawless experience at the Kinzie. We absolutely loved our room, everything was clean, well-designed, spacious, and first class. The view from our room was incredible, with huge glass windows. The bed was super comfortable and the bathrobes very soft. The service was impeccable and the location was ideal. I would highly recommend the Kinzie to anyone needing a hotel in Chicago. A great plus is the continental breakfast served every morning on each floor by the elevators. You can roll out of bed in your pajamas, grab whatever you want and take it back to your room. Also every evening they have a cocktail hour with free drinks and appetizers. It was a nice touch that made our stay that much more enjoyable.The woman who checked us in at the front desk when we arrived was possibly the friendliest check-in experience we've ever had. They had a plate of fresh cookies and hot apple cider as well. I literally can't think of anything negative about this hotel. If I had to scrounge for something, it would be that the room came with bathrobes but not slippers. Also when I picked up the room phone to call the front desk, there was no explanation written on the phone as to which number to dial to reach the front desk or guest services. Those were the only two ""complaints"" I can think of.I highly recommend the Kinzie hotel and would go back there in a second!",nan,nan,ta_s1437
trip_advisor,"Overall, a nice place. Friendly staff, nice decor, comfortable beds. I had a few issues with the alleyway noise and some sketchy Wifi service, but it was manageable. The free breakfast isn't gourmet, as listed. It is, however, a very nice treat. The in room Keurig coffee maker was nice, but I never had anything but decaf pods. I did order room service and the food for. Harry Caray's was wonderful and it was delivered quickly.",nan,nan,ta_s1438
trip_advisor,"This hotel and really really lovely! It is not a massive chain type, but personal and Boutique like. The staff are fun, great at what they do and extremely helpful on all fronts! I loved not having to eat breakfast in a packed breakfast room with other guests. Breakfast buffets are set up on each floor and you ( or in my case my hubby!) take a tray with your chosen food back to your room! The location is ideal, especially when weekends are actually only 2 days!!! Very central yet surprisingly quiet! Chicago is seriously underrated! I will return and wouldn't hesitate to stay in the Kinzy again!",nan,nan,ta_s1439
trip_advisor,"Stayed three nights for a trade show.The bed was as comfortable as they get. Everything in the room (like a mini suite)was very nice. The bathroom was very nice. Breakfast served on every floor.....yogurt, breads, fruit, cheese, eggs, good coffee. Free drinks and antipasto are served on the 6th floor early evenings.Harry Caray's is across the street. House of Blues is 1/2 block away. The place is surrounded by nice restaurants. It's a quick cab ride to McCormick place.This is a smaller 6 story hotel where the attention to detail is great.I stayed here with my family several times back when it was the Amalfi and the hotel has improved as the Kinzie.The staff truly gets it. I have another trade show in Chicago in two weeks and I'll stay at the Kinzie again.",nan,nan,ta_s1441
trip_advisor,"I stayed at the Kinzie Hotel for one evening to get some rest after a flight from London. The hotel is ideally located in the city. About a five-minute walk from the Magnificent Mile, and maybe a 10-15 minute walk to the Loop (depending on where you are going). There are some great bars and restaurants on Kinzie Street (one of my favorites, Mercadito, is about a five-minute walk away).Unfortunately, the hotel itself is not as great as its location. Check-in was fine, although I can't say the front desk staff were incredibly enthusiastic with regard to assisting me. I booked a king room through an independent hotel booking site, but was placed in a handicap room with two queen beds on the sixth floor (Room 618). That wasn't a big issue for me as I was traveling alone, but please make sure that you receive the room you actually booked if you want a king bed. The room is located right around the corner from the elevators. This caused two huge issues for me. First, the door is thin, so you can hear the elevator ""ding"" each time it arrives and departs. Even worse, the hotel sets up a breakfast in the lobby in front of the elevator each morning. I wanted rest when I arrived - I did not want to be woken up at 6:30 a.m. by glass clinking while the staff set up the breakfast. I guess it's a convenience for the remaining rooms on the floor to have a breakfast table so close, but for the 4-8 rooms that are closest to the breakfast table, it's a major annoyance to deal with sounds from the breakfast in the morning. I would suggest that you ensure that your room is not located close to the elevator (or perhaps the hotel will move breakfast to a conference room or a more convenient location that will allow ALL of their guests to rest).The bed was comfortable, and the windows were relatively soundproof despite the nightlife outside. The room, however, definitely needed some TLC. There was a hole near the bottom of the wall in the hallway, and a tear on the seat in the bathroom. Additionally, the bathtub was rusty, and the toilet had a flushing problem (at times, it would continually flush without stopping). On the plus side, the hotel happily watched my luggage while I shopped the next day. It would have been nice to be asked at checkout, however, about my stay. I'll find another hotel the next time I stay in the city.",nan,nan,ta_s1442
trip_advisor,"This boutique style hotel had one thing that stood out - customer service. The staff were SUPER friendly and helpful, and a good part of what made the stay enjoyable.The included morning breakfast (continental style, no hot foods) and a wonderful nightly happy hour with light appetizers and a few included drinks were additional highlights.The rooms themselves are modern, beautifully appointed (a bit trendy), and incredibly clean. They were pretty much true to what was pictured online, except keep in mind that this hotel occupies the first 6 floors of some kind of business building. So you're not getting sweeping skyline views which may be suggested by the tower that's pictured for the hotel. Also, some of the of the pictures highlight rooms with large curved windows overlooking the city - these are actually the two room suites. The standard/deluxe rooms are smaller and most with not particularly great views. It IS possible to upgrade to king rooms with corner windows, that have slightly better city views. Wifi included!Lastly, location of hotel is fantastic. On State and Kinzie streets, within walking distance to Michigan Mile shopping and Trump towers, boat tours (Wendella) and lots of delicious restaurants. Made for a great weekend visit!",nan,nan,ta_s1443
trip_advisor,"We stayed during Labour Day weekend and picked this hotel based on its location to Millenium Park for the Jazz festival, to the Mag Mile for shopping and to the South Loop for more shopping. We arrived and were promptly greeted and offered a refreshing drink of naturally flavoured water at the front desk (though the staff do their intake while sitting down and guests have to look down at them...a tad odd).This was our third trip to Chicago in four years and the best hotel we've stayed at...especially since were also celebrating our anniversary. Our room overlooked the street and provided amusing entertainment from the hotel across the street due to the large windows - we just had to remember to close the blinds so we didn't return the favour! The room was very comfortable from the space, to the bed to the ammenities. Each morning we enjoyed our breakfast (high carb) on the couch while planning our day.Next time we return to Chicago, we will most likely stay here again. Thank you!",nan,nan,ta_s1444
trip_advisor,"I travel to Chicago often and had the opportunity to stay over the weekend for a family trip. We stumbled upon the Kinzie. My wife, a hotel snob, was unimpressed because it is owned by Amalfi which is often less than 4 stars. However, we were pleasantly surprised. The hotel staff was very friendly and genuine. The accommodations and hotel are a boutique flavor, so it has to be in your palate. Everything was nice with a breakfast bar and hospitality club before dinner.",nan,nan,ta_s1445
trip_advisor,"The Kinzie is in a great central location for getting around the various tourist attractions, shops and restaurants within Chicago.

We were initially placed in a corner room on 6th floor but it was immediately across from another building with huge air conditioning units on top which my husband found quite noisy so we asked to swap and Jose kindly sorted out a move to an alternative room for us. We were on 4th floor which does mean that you will still hear traffic as the hotel is in a great location - I think the top floor is 6 so it will be hard to avoid noise, so if you're a light sleeper it might not be the best choice of hotel. My husband needs to use ear plugs at night anyway and he found this fine. I did hear some sirens and horns but it certainly wasn't constant but is possibly a very slight negative against the hotel but can't be helped. Otherwise the hotel is great, staff are welcoming and friendly - doormen were great fun! The continental breakfast is ideal to set you up for the day (cereal, toast, bagels, pastries and donuts, fruit and yoghurt, juice and teas) - although it would be nice to have somewhere to sit and eat it other than in your room but it's fine for a few days. The evening reception is great - free cocktails (2 choices) & beer (312 by local Goose Island brewery) with tokens provided at check in. There were also nibbles - we didn't get an opportunity to go every night but thoroughly enjoyed it along with the opportunity to speak to other guests. The room was really clean and modern, although it did seem minimal space for storing clothes if you were staying for a longer period of time. I had contacted the hotel via Facebook prior to visiting the city as we had booked to enjoy a late anniversary trip and the hotel very kindly provided us with chocolate covered strawberries and champagne which was a lovely touch, especially as they also have me a hand written note to thank me for getting in touch. Customer services is definitely a key within the hotel. Overall, would certainly return to the hotel as it had loads of great benefits and was in a perfect location to travel around the city by foot.",nan,nan,ta_s1446
trip_advisor,"Booked this hotel for a weekend in Chicago when there was a huge convention and the usual hotels we stay at were priced out of range. What a lovely surprise! The Kinzie staff were super friendly, check-in was quick even though we were there early. Room was fine - no view - with comfortable bed and couch. Nice idea to have continental breakfast on each floor. They even had hard cooked eggs for us Atkins folk! The location of the hotel is great - on State and Kinzie - with everything Chicago has to offer close by. I would certainly consider this again for our next visit.",nan,nan,ta_s1447
trip_advisor,"We had a lovely experience - hospitable, well mannered staff - from the valet to the front desk, to the housekeeping629 - corner room- great view - stylish furnishings - cool electric sliding blinds - very comfortable beds - and importantly, an actual door separating the bedroom from the living room giving us privacy from the boys sleeping on the pullout sofa. And outlets near your bed for your phone - not fifty feet away (a pet peeve) . You are facing directly into the windows of other hotels, though, so strategic use of those blinds will be necessary.What was especially nice were the extras - free FAST Wifi - wifi is often promised at other hotels but rarely is consistent. This is the ONLY hotel in which my son did not complain about the WiFi.Continental breakfast - I think a very generous spread, especially for the middle of a big city - danish, donuts, bagels, bread, cereal, juices, teas, coffee, apples, oranges, bananas, yogurt, milk and my favorite - a little protein - hard boiled eggs. Finding these kind of ""home-y"" items in the middle of the city would have cost 30 dollars. Being able to tiptoe down the hall and have these items ready for the kids without having even to get them out of bed was a HUGE help in keeping moods light. PLUS the evening cocktails were accompanied by antipasto - also very helpful when the kids are getting peckish, but you are not quite ready to go out for the evening. And you don't have to have a cocktail - a complimentary soda or juice is also offered.Tip: The valet usually would get the car faster than 15 minutes, but if you are on a tight schedule, call and arrange for the car 15 minutes or so in advance of your departure. This is not unreasonable - when I lived in a condo on Lake Shore Drive, this was customary. Is there city noise? Yes. But that is because you are in the city, not because the hotel is remiss. If you want to be in a convenient location, but have a more unique boutique experience, Kinzie is a great option. I would absolutely stay here again.",nan,nan,ta_s1448
trip_advisor,"We stayed in the Kinzie for 4 nights before travelling to the Big Apple. The staff are welcoming and the hotel is spotlessly clean. The breakfast was a bonus and was served on each floor and then taken to your room. It wasn't a hot cooked breakfast but still adequate and enjoyable. We stayed on the third floor at the side of the hotel and our only complaint was the noise from the bars in the street below. The noise kept us awake for a couple of nights. It maybe better to request a higher room if you want to sleep well. The rooms are quite spacious, we had a corner window with a couch so we were able to watch the action outside.Would visit the Kinzie again but in another room.",nan,nan,ta_s1449
trip_advisor,"From the second you hit the door you are pampered in a beautiful setting. From the doormen, to the staff that checks you in to the cleaning staff, everyone shares the same ethos of perfection in service. The location of the property ideal in the heart of River North in downtown Chicago. Virtually everywhere yu want to go is walkable. The room was beautifully appointed and immaculate. The lobby is small so breakfast is served on each floor across from the elevators. The food was delicious and there were plenty of choices. The business center was far superior to many comparable properties. I plan on staying at the Kinzie for all future stays. Each room has a small refrigerator which was very helpful. Wifi was free and fast. I confined to be impressed with every element of my stay,",nan,nan,ta_s1450
trip_advisor,"I booked this room for a weekend away from Groupon.Love the modern ambiance. Had a great Happy Hour Mingle room and everybody was extremely pleasant. Wish they had a spa, I bet it would be great! The complementary, breakfast was nice. Located on every floor by the elevators. Coffee, tea, juice bagels, muffins, fruit, cheese, eggs. Great lil restaurant called mercadidtos next door.Room was small but okay. The bed was super comfy and Carpet was old and had ripples in it and the wallpaper in the bathroom was peeling. The ""blackout drapes"" didn't close. Not because they were broken, they just weren't designed to. The desk chair was disgusting to sit on. Tiny old school fridge that needed defrosting. The fan in the bathroom was broken but there was double shower heads. Not sure why, but okay.",nan,nan,ta_s1451
trip_advisor,"as a group of people we stayed in this hotel from Apr 18-20. all was excellent from booking stages over the email and phone to arrival, check into the rooms. rooms were great and clean, service excellent, breakfast very good. Location is so good, that you do not need transportation, all main attractions are around hotel.",nan,nan,ta_s1452
trip_advisor,"Loved this hotel, very well positioned for most of the major attractions in Chicago. Staff were wonderful, the room was amazing, really clean and the best bathroom towels going. The breakfast was really good and you can have as much as you like, with fresh juices, coffee etc and plenty of choices of food. The free evening drinks was a really good idea. We felt totally looked after all the time we were there.",nan,nan,ta_s1453
trip_advisor,"The Kinzie presents a compelling value proposition for those who want an excellent, unique place to stay without enduring the ridiculous prices, general snobbery, and lack of personal service found at nearby upscale chain hotels.During the business portion of a trip to Chicago in August, my wife and I stayed at one of those upscale chains. After the conference was over, and vacation time began, we hopped across the river to the Kinzie, and we were amazed at the difference. Let's compare:* The upscale chain wanted $27 per person per day for a minimalist, allegedly continental breakfast.* At the Kinzie, a continental breakfast is free. And it's served on every floor of the hotel.* The upscale chain scoffs at the notion of in-room coffee without overcharging for the service.* The Kinzie provides an in-room Keurig, and they're happy to give extra k-cups if you need them.* The upscale chain wanted $15 per day for internet service.* The Kinzie gives it to you for free.* The upscale chain charged $100 more per night.* The Kinzie was reasonably priced and provided a room that was roughly 50% larger.* The upscale chain had sparse staff who were somewhat aloof.* The Kinzie treats you like an actual guest - as though you're a friend visiting town, and they're excited to welcome you in.* The upscale chain had the standard upscale bar.* The Kinzie provides a free evening reception with cocktails and hors d'oeuvre.* Need a cab at the upscale chain? Sure, as long as someone's there to call it into the loading area.* Need one at the Kinzie? No worries; the always-on-hand, friendly bellman will take care of that.Sure, the Kinzie has a couple of cons and oddities:* The hotel only occupies the bottom six floors of its building, so street noise can be a factor on nights like Friday and Saturday as young socialites spill into the street from nearby bars and clubs.* The L is about four blocks away, which can be moderately annoying if you're taking advantage of public transportation.* The corner suites are great on space, but perhaps some of that hallway width could have been apportioned to the bathroom instead.* Elevator ""bells"" sound strikingly akin to the bird whose tail gets yanked and squawks quittin' time in the ""Flintstones"" opening.Cartoon bird reminders aside, we look forward to returning the Kinzie whenever we're in Chicago. And when we do, we'll feel like we're among friends.",nan,nan,ta_s1454
trip_advisor,"Within walking distance of subway stops, terrific restaurants, and the Miracle Mile shopping district, this hotel was a great find. The new owners did a great job renovating the old Amalfi hotel. The rooms are comfortable and stylishly furnished. They kept the old tub and tub fixtures, but other than that everything seems to have been repainted and refurnished. I wouldn't call it a ""luxury"" hotel necessarily but it's definitely a stylish boutique hotel. Request a room on a top floor away from the hotel elevators and the sixth floor lounge. The hotel offers a complimentary continental breakfast and staff set it out on each floor just outside the elevators. Folks stumble out of the rooms to get coffee and danish and you can hear their conversation and the clanging of plates. The walls are pretty thin so you can also hear your neighbor open and close the blinds, flush the toilet, etc. however these are minor complaints. The staff are super friendly and the location is just great. I will definitely stay here again.",nan,nan,ta_s1455
trip_advisor,"centrally located, this hotel is close to all the major sites, to the river, Millenium park etc. It is surrounded by restaurants, coffee shops, and what not,so we enjoyed being at the center of things. Staff friendly and helpful. Room spacious clean and comfortable with great insulation so we slept like angels....very nice idea of serving breakfast on the floor loby, though sometimes it was hilarious to chase the coffee on one floor and the milk on another but really no drama. small intimate and very welcoming.",nan,nan,ta_s1456
trip_advisor,"We spent four nights at the Kinzie hotel. Overall, it was a decent hotel in an excellent location. The continental breakfast consisted of coffee/tea/juice, a variety of breads, pastries, yogurt and fruit. It was centrally located on every floor. After four days, the choices did become slightly repetitive, but we still found it convenient. The rooms were average sized and had very comfortable king sized beds. Each room came with two bath robes. Unfortunately, one of ours went missing after housekeeping the first day and was never replaced. We had some other issues with the housekeeping services in that our soap bars were never replenished and we had multiple 9am knocks to see if the room had been vacated for cleaning.The hotel also has a reception with drinks and appetizers each night, which we did not have a chance to check out. The Kinzie is situated in a great location to experience downtown Chicago and the hotel staff were friendly and accommodating. Apart from some minor issues, it was an enjoyable stay.",nan,nan,ta_s1457
trip_advisor,"I've stayed at the Kinzie several times, including several as the Amalfi, and the hotel has a great location and is nicely furnished and the staff is quite helpful. It is nice to have the little cocktail hour where you can relax over a drink or two before heading out for dinner or a show.",nan,nan,ta_s1458
trip_advisor,"We booked a very affordable stay at Kinzie and received a 4+ stay! The hotel is very clean, comfortable and conveniently located. The continental breakfast was fabulous and a super convenience allowing us to get out early to explore the wonderful city of Chicago. The lounge with drinks and snacks is soo very well done. Concierge were always very pleasant and helpful. Would definitely stay again. Highly recommended too.",nan,nan,ta_s1459
trip_advisor,"This may have been the best hotel stay my wife and I have ever had. The small lobby has 2 persons sitting at a low desk. They function as both receptionists and concierges. As a concierge, they always have the right answer about visiting the sites or choosing a restaurant. And, there is never a line at the front desk or at the elevators.The rooms are spacious, clean, and well organized. A unique feature is their included breakfast, which is served on every floor. That means you can go for your food and take it back to your room, if you desire. In the evening, there is a complementary reception with snack foods as well as beer, wine, and hard liquor.Valet parking is expensive, but no different than at any other near downtown hotel. This hotel is listed as being in River North, which is close to everywhere you might want to go. In addition, this has the largest concentration of fine restaurants that I have ever seen. All in all, this added up to some great meals.The people are friendly and very helpful, in addition to the hotel's great location. We can't wait to come back.",nan,nan,ta_s1460
trip_advisor,"On our recent visit to Chicago We stayed (3sisters) at the Kinzie. Not only were the rooms immaculately designed..marvelous beds etc, but the staff treated us like QUEENS. From the moment we arrived MEG and Julian were outstanding along with Rafti who met us at the curb and immediately took our car and belongings to the appropriate spots. We were not allowed to lift a finger. The customer service was outstanding. The park and go rates were terrific. Harry Caray's was right across the street. Check out was effortless with 3 credit cards, no questions asked. We feel it is the best hotel in Chicago and we are pretty fussy!! Actually I didn't want to admit to the ""best stay"" in Chicago because we always want them to have a room available for us on our next stay. So Don't let the word out. Basically the STAFF was tremendous.Kudos to the management for selecting and training such a wonderful, personable staff.Until next time..can't wait.Surprise..an intimate experience in the heart of Chicago.",nan,nan,ta_s1461
trip_advisor,"We recently stayed here from Fri-Mon. We were on the 2nd floor on the north side of the building. Didn't hear any bar noise. I'm guessing for those who did hear the bars their rooms they were in the front portion of the hotel facing Kinzie St. Quick 3 or 4 block walk to Red Line and vice versa south to the river. Really nice rooms and just convenient for everything we wanted. Flying into O'Hare, jump on the Blue Line to the stop just before the Loop and grab a cab from there. Save about $40 in total depending on traffic.",nan,nan,ta_s1462
trip_advisor,"We stayed at the Kinzie this past weekend. The room and hotel are beautiful, the doormen are super friendly. However it was impossible to sleep in our room as the noise from the bar behind the building could be heard through the walls even in the bathroom with the door closed. The noise stopped around 5 a.m. Not a nice place to try and get a good night's sleep. So if you are booking this hotel request a quiet side of the hotel room. I mentioned this to the girl behind the desk when we checked out and she said I should have known this and requested the quiet side of the hotel when I booked. Not the answer form her I expected. We have stayed here many times before and did not experience the noise issue. Quite a letdown for our 40th Anniversary.",nan,nan,ta_s1463
trip_advisor,"Stayed at the Kinzie for 5 nights in August and what a great hotel it is! The room was spacious, clean & modern with everything you need. All staff were helpful & pleasant & the added bonus of a free drink every evening in the small cocktail bar was most welcome! Self service breakfast on each floor allowing residents to enjoy a leisurely breakfast in their own room was different & may not appeal to everybody; we loved it! Excellent central location with many bars & restaurants in the vicinity and a 2 minute walk from the 'L'. Free wifi too! Great value for money & would definitely stay here again.",nan,nan,ta_s1464
trip_advisor,"The Kinzie is a nicely located, and well run independent hotel in the River North neighborhood of downtown Chicago. Although it does not have a large lobby or amenities of many larger, chain hotels, it is a contemporary, attractive, personally-friendly and comfortable property. In the case of our stay, it was also an excellent value for the three nights that we stayed there. As guests, we very much appreciated the personal attention and hospitality we received from nearly everyone on staff, including a very attentive young bellman named Gerry, who was eager to make our stay more enjoyable. The complementary breakfast arrangement is very efficiently arranged, as it is set up on every floor adjacent to the elevators, for easy access from one's room. In the late afternoon/evenings, the hotel offers a complimentary happy hour including cocktails and light hors d'oeuvres on the top floor. The bartender does a nice job managing this every evening. While there is no bar or restaurant located within the hotel, there are many choices located in easy walking distance within the River North neighborhood. The rooms were comfortable and well appointed, albeit not particularly large. We will return to the Kinzie for future stays when we visit Chicago.",nan,nan,ta_s1465
trip_advisor,We stayed for 3 nights 11th to 14th August. The staff were most helpful and pleasant. The bed was super comfortable. Everything was spotlessly clean. Breakfast was buffet style available on all floors and you brought it back to the room. Unusual but great. WIFI was free and Concierge was really good (from Sri Lanka and ordered our taxi for six people at a decent rate. Hotel is near to boat cruise and tour pickup points - just past the Trump tower and over the bridge. Would definitely return and will recommend to friends who may be visiting Chicago.,nan,nan,ta_s1466
trip_advisor,"We had a very good stay. Very clean, new furnishings, comfortable beds. In a great location. You can walk to most of the architecture gems along the river. No need to pay for the tours.Gym was ok. Could have used some resistance bands and an exercise ball, but adequate overall.Breakfast is continental and served on your floor to take back to your room. As continental goes, above average.Overall, we'd come back and recommend",nan,nan,ta_s1467
trip_advisor,"My husband and I first visited the Kinzie hotel during our first visit to Chicago in 2009 when we were dating. The location was amazing, the staff were extremely helpful and we loved the continental breakfast and cocktail hour that was included. The rooms are very comfortable and charming. Fast forward four years to 2013, my now husband was planning to propose and decided that he had to bring me back to Chicago and the Kinzie hotel! He woke me up and told me we were going on a road trip and when we arrived in Chicago 7 hours after departing Toronto and pulled into the Kinzie hotel I was thrilled! Needless to say, the Kinzie hotel is a very special place and we very much look forward to going back to celebrate many anniversaries!",nan,nan,ta_s1468
trip_advisor,"We stayed at the Kinzie last week for 4 nights for our honeymoon. We had an amazing stay! The staff were so friendly and attentive. When we arrived we were early and our room wasn't quite ready. We left for about an hour for lunch (while they held our luggage for us!) and when we came back it still wasn't ready. However, they got us into another room right which was wonderful! Everytime we entered or exited the hotel we were greeted and told to have a wonderful day. Just a nice touch that you don't get at larger hotels. We were on the 5th floor with a street view and of Harry Caray's Steakhouse restaurant. The location is fantastic. We walked to pretty much everywhere we wanted to go (except Wrigley Field and Union Station). At check in we had some troubles with our Canadian credit/debit cards working and they were very accommodating. The same issues came up on our second last day, and again they were extremely accommodating and friendly while we solved the issue.They were aware it was our honeymoon, and when we returned from the Cubs game on our first night, we were greeted with a bottle of sparkling wine and chocolate covered strawberries along with a lovely note congratulating us on our marriage. Again, so nice.The bed was SO comfortable, and while the room was not huge there was everything you needed and everything was very stylish and updated. The extra perks made the stay. The continental breakfast on each floor was great. It wasn't something that we wanted every morning but had it a few times. There was juice, donuts, bagels, muffins, coffee, tea (all kinds of tazo tea), fruit etc. The reception from 5-8 was wonderful! They had different snacks (cheese, meat, bread etc) as well as a full bar. I was expecting small drinks and little selection however, this was NOT the case.Overall, I highly recommend staying at the Kinzie, it was a great experience and much more reasonably priced than other alternatives. I will be staying at the Kinzie again, and will be recommending it to anyone I know travelling to Chicago!",nan,nan,ta_s1469
trip_advisor,"This is a beautiful hotel in a perfect location .. You can walk to most of the best locations in the city ... The rooms at the Kinzie are very nice and well decorated.. It provides a breakfast every morning and has happy hour every evening. You receive a free drink token when you check in. Another bright spot with this hotel is the staff ""especially the check in staff"".. It was perfect for a weekend in the city..",nan,nan,ta_s1470
trip_advisor,"Staying at the Kinzie is a great way to introduce yourself to Chicago and immerse yourself immediately into the food and art scene of the downtown area. Location is very convenient for exploring and ambling around.It's a small boutique hotel with a clean, modern vibe that's warmly welcoming...a feeling I thought was whimsically represented by the minty-blue H2O+ square soap sitting on the cool, stark white dish in our bathroom. The grey/white walls are decorated with framed photographs of vintage scenes as well as fun modern art pieces which could include the funky furniture in the lobby. The Kinzie staff is friendly and attentive, always greeting you on the way in and out. The bellhops are very dapper in their light grey uniforms and fedoras. Fresh fruit flavored water is available in the lobby.Yays:- Free breakfast is served on each floor from 6:30 to 10 am, set up right across from the elevators. How convenient is that? You'll see your neighbors in their white bathrobes out examining the continental breakfast choices: pastries, bagels, breads, cereal, fruit, hard boiled eggs, coffee, juice, tea, yogurt. There's a white tray in your room that you can take with you to carry all your selections back for a leisurely breakfast in bed moment. - The free Manager's reception in the evenings is on the 6th floor with open bar (you're given a token for a free drink when you register) and a tasty assortment of appetizers. It's a low-lit, intimate setting with bar tables and chairs.- Everything was clean and comfortable...the room, beds, decor.- Our room had two queen beds-- a choice not offered at many hotels but very appreciated by families.- Location is excellent: great access to restaurants and Michigan Avenue. 5 minute walk to Grand metro station where you can catch the Red line to Wrigley Field, 10 minute walk to Millenium Park (""Bean"", Cloud Gate) and a little further to the fantastic Art Institute of Chicago museum. - Considering the hotel is on a main street right in the middle of downtown, you would think you'd hear a lot more street noise. Our room was on the 5th floor and we heard more from the ice machine across the hallway. There is street noise, just not as much as expected.- The small gym is located on the 5th floor which was very convenient for us.Nays:- We traveled at peak time so prices were higher, but still better than many other hotels nearby.- That we couldn't stay longer!Interesting:- Kinzie has a very pet-friendly policy with rooms and services geared towards furry guests. For those of us who are unfortunately allergic to man's best friend, you should ask for rooms on the non-pet floors.Staying at the Kinzie helped make our visit to Chicago more enjoyable and accessible...would definitely come back!",nan,nan,ta_s1471
trip_advisor,"This was our 2nd stay at the Kinzie and now that it's completely remodeled, we had a wonderful experience. The room with a king size bed and a large bathroom was comfortable and quiet. Breakfast was included, with a nice choice of fruits, grains, yogurts, cheeses and beverages. The evening cocktail hour was also a plus, with great wines and appetizers. Katie Russell our hostess was exceptional and offered several ideas for great restaurants. The bellmen were courteous and helpful as we loaded and departed in heavy rain. One unexpected perk: after the repairman fixed the running toilet on the morning of our 2nd day, he left us two large chocolate wrenches...very tasty Charlie! thanks for your great hospitality.",nan,nan,ta_s1473

Went to the ""Bean"" and stopped to hear the Chicago Symphony rehearse then we went to the Field Museum and when we returned to the hotel there were freshly made cookies. We went to the sixth floor where 2 drinks per person plus appetizers were included in our rate. The next morning there was a nice breakfast by the elevators that you could bring back to your room. All members of the staff were exceptionally friendly.",nan,nan,ta_s1475
trip_advisor,"Just stayed at the Kinzie July 11-13 and it was great. First thing is that it is only a block away from the Blue Line Subway (EL) that comes from O'Hare airport (Clark & Lake exit). Its a 30-40 minute train ride but for $2.50 each its good. The bed was comfortable, room was clean, blinds covered the windows well so it was dark and the noise was next to nil. Slept really well there. All the personnel were exceptionally polite and welcoming. Jose at the front desk was great for giving us ideas where to eat and advising on some attractions. Everything is walking distance in my opinion as we were close to the ""magnificent mile"", Millennium Park, Art Museum and the river where the boat tours start from. They do a appetizer/drink 5-8 up on the 6th floor which was nice as it held you over before you go out for dinner. Complimentary drink and food (cut up veggies, cheese, sliced meats) were a nice treat. The gym is really clean with 1 recumbent bike, couple treadmills, elliptical, and couple weight machines as well as some free weights. Overall I would recommend this hotel and will be going back again for sure.",nan,nan,ta_s1476
trip_advisor,"Travelled with sixteen ladies from our Bookclub to experience Chicago and it started on the right foot by choosing to stay at this incredible hotel. Location, location, location! Inexpensive cab fare from the train station and we could walk to most tourist sights, close to awesome shopping and dining in safe and beautiful neighbourhood. Clean crisp modern hotel with the most friendly staff, handsome and helpful doormen and all staff said hello first and nothing was too much trouble including the maid service. Breakfast served on each floor so walking out in one of the provided bathrobes to get a coffee and juice was no problem. Hard boiled eggs and lovely chocolate croissants and yogurts and fruits and all types of items to toast. Started the day off right in such a convenient manner. Happy hour each evening with one free drink and appetizers provided, ( I'm talking prosciutto wrapped asparagus not chips and dip) rooms were very clean, smelled good, bathrooms were immaculate and towels smelled fresh, beds were super comfy. Slept well every night even in the middle of a noisy metropolis. We will definitely stay here again! No need to look any where else !",nan,nan,ta_s1477
trip_advisor,This hotel is in a great location. I wanted to see the downtown in night and this hotel was in perfect location even though they don't have rooms in the upper floors. Staff was good and room was super clean. Evening drinks were really nice ;)Only issue I had was - I called the hotel in the morning to check if I can check in early at 11. They said it's ok and can come. When I went there room was not ready and we'd to wait nearly till 3 PM with small kids. I hope they will be more sensible in future.,nan,nan,ta_s1478
trip_advisor,"I was traveling to The Langham Chicago (5-star hotel) for business with a group and gave up my room there for one of my clients when we learned that hotel was overbooked. The Kinzie is located just around the corner and the Langham booked me there. At first I thought the Kinzie looked cheap/chintzy online and I was concerned but my Langham contact assured me it had just been refurbished/updated. My room was clean, the furnishings were new, the bed linens were of good quality, and the robes were nice. The long counter ""desk"" made it easy to spread out my work and get a lot done. They set up a breakfast buffet in the elevator foyer area on every floor each morning - coffees, juices, cereals, yogurts, muffins/pastries, toaster w/breads & bagels, whole fruit, string cheese. There's also a lounge on the 6th floor and you're given a coin good for 1 drink for each night of your stay. Due to business commitments I was not able to visit the lounge but I did peek in to check it out and it seemed fairly nice - fun lighting, big screen TV, variety of seating/tables - and it was busy. The cons of The Kinzie are minimal: small closet, I could hear the ppl in the room next to me raising and lowering their shades, could also hear what I assume to be construction noise well into the night even with earplugs.",nan,nan,ta_s1479
trip_advisor,"Very clean, great location and nice free continental breakfast on each floor.Nice optional place for breakfast around the corner at bin61Funny, I left tip money under the pillow for the maid and she did not take it and left in on the table instead.Like all Hotels the parking was expensive $55Good Hotel if you want to keep it simple without paying all the extras like swimming pool ect.I would go back.",nan,nan,ta_s1480
trip_advisor,"If you're looking for a well-positioned boutique hotel for a short stay in the downtown area of Chicago, then look no further than Kinzie Hotel. Ask for a room on the highest floor possible and in the back if you can handle the darkness with which you might be faced, but that will allow you to avoid the yelling revellers complained of my another review. Some great deals can be had for this property if you know how to use some of the online discount booking services.TL;DR, Kinzie Hotel is comfortable, welcoming and well-run. Recommended.",nan,nan,ta_s1481

While on my out to shop, Meg the concierge told me all the great places to go and that old navy was having their famous one day $1 flip flop sale and went out of her why to surprise me with a pair when she found out that I went the other direction and missed it to watch Colombia in the World Cup ! Melissa the front house manager is completely on it! She made sure we had all the extras we request and informed us about their new ""we get it"" policy which I'm a big fan of with all our travels.

trip_advisor,We stayed in the Kinzie on the last leg of our trip to the US.The room was large and clean with coffee-maker and snacks.We availed of the complementary breakfast each morning which unusually was served on each floor.We also enjoyed the Happy Hour each evening when drinks and hors d oeuvres were served.The hotel is very well located - close to all attractions and transport links and is close to many bars and restaurants.We were particularly impressed by the check-in staff - polite and friendly. We felt that we were treated very fairly when our flight into Chicago was cancelled at very short notice and subsequently our cancellation call to the hotel was literally at the 11th hour.On check-out the cost of our first night was deducted which is not often the case in other hotels who use the small print to take as much as possible.We would certainly stay here again and would recommend the Kinzie to anyone visiting the Windy City.,nan,nan,ta_s1483
trip_advisor,"We stayed here over the Thanksgiving holiday weekend to attend the parade and go shopping. The hotel used to be called the Amalfi and is now the Kinzie. Room was great and clean, staff were wonderful. We didn't know about the Manager's Happy Hour until we checked it and this became something we attended daily, just so we wouldn't miss it! Great snacks and drinks, very generous! It was nice to interact with other hotel guests too. Most hotels don't have such a nice free feature and we really enjoyed it each night of our stay. Walking was easy and felt safe, close to good bars and places to eat.",nan,nan,ta_s1484
trip_advisor,"We stayed at the Kinzie for a split week in June. Five nights followed by a break and return for four nights. The staff handled our departure and return smoothly, promptly and with great attention to detail. Moreover the valet staff and staff assistants provided every service we requested with speed and equanimity. Buffet continental breakfast is beautifully presented and everything tastes delicious. They use a really good bakery!Our beautifully appointed corner room was comfortable, light from huge windows, great view of the city. The bathroom is roomy, great shower and terrific, large towels. The corner was a great way to stash our belongings without cluttering the room itself.Our only misgiving is that these rooms are really too tight for extended stays. While we were there the great service made up for this, but we would not plan our annual two week visit to Chicago at this hotel. Short stays are great. We were taken care of like royalty.",nan,nan,ta_s1485
trip_advisor,"I booked this hotel to celebrate my daughter's birthday and we were not disappointed. Having breakfast right outside our room and the complimentary happy hour makes this our number one choice for our stays in Chicago from now on!!!. The customer service was above and beyond our expectations.!!! Special thanks to Jose, Monica and Meghan. Great location with easy walking to Magnificent Mile and the Loop for shopping. Clean, clean, quiet(6th floor) spacious rooms with really comfortable beds. The bathrobes were a bonus touch that you just don't get unless you are paying so much more. Great restaurants in walking distance too We have traveled and stayed at many hotels across the world and this one stands out by far for customer service and quality!! Bravo Kinzie -",nan,nan,ta_s1486
trip_advisor,"This was my first stay at the Kinzie. The staff was fantastic and extremely welcoming. Every day when I arrived, they greeted me and asked if there was anything I needed. The room was very clean and modern. Most importantly for me, the bed was especially comfortable. I appreciated the complimentary wine and appetizers at the manager's reception and the free breakfast was very convenient. There are plenty of dining options within a very short walking distance. The only issue I had was the noise from outside. I'm guessing it was because I was on the 4th floor and so close to the street. I wish they had a vending machine or some way to get a soda without leaving the hotel. Granted, there is a 7-11 just around the corner, so not a deal breaker. Even with the noise issue I would definitely stay there again.",nan,nan,ta_s1487
trip_advisor,"Stayed two nights for business and was very pleased. Rooms were nice and the love seat and ottoman a great plus. Comfortable bed with nice linens and large counter space in bathroom with magnifying mirror. The cocktail/appetizer reception another bonus especially since it goes until 8pm. We found them to be very popular. Also a great benefit to only have to walk to elevator to grab breakfast. Although no eggs or hot food there was a big variety of scones, muffins, toast, bagels, cheese, croissants, yogurt, cereal, etc. All of that with great service. Hard to beat.",nan,nan,ta_s1488
trip_advisor,"Spent a couple of nights here for work - great location for nightlife and access to business district. Chicago is such a great city and the location lets you make the most of it all. Breakfast included is great with decent selection - served on each floor in the lift lobby and you take the food back to you room. Rooms were spacious, clean and service friendly. Look forward to coming back again in future - only minor downside is some rooms are noisy due their location being next to adjacent buildings - but not enough of a deterrent. Will be back!",nan,nan,ta_s1489
trip_advisor,"I was a little wary about staying in the same hotel for a second time, especially as it has changed name and been refurbished since our last visit however we were not disappointed & so glad we came back! This hotel is second to none. The staff are friendly & helpful, the location is incredible, surrounded by some of the best restaurants & bars in Chicago and the complimentary breakfast each morning is a very nice (and rare) bonus. Rooms haven't changed in size but the decor is bright, fresh & spacious. Oh and did I mention the happy hour every evening from 5-8pm?! A great way to start an evening out. I will continue to recommend this hotel to everyone I know!",nan,nan,ta_s1490
trip_advisor,"Fabulous find in River North! Great renovation. Modern boutique hotel. Loved the complimentary breakfast each morning and especially the complimentary cocktail reception each night! Nice location in the heart of river north and close to mag mile shopping. Wifi is also included. One downside was the noise. We stayed in a suite on the 3rd floor and the entire wall was windows, which was beautiful, but noisy. We stayed over memorial day weekend and it was noisy every night. So if you can ask for a higher floored room do. Besides that, no other complaints. Great, newly renovated, boutique hotel.",nan,nan,ta_s1491
trip_advisor,"The excellent reviews for this property convinced me that it was worth a try during a particularly busy period in downtown hotels. It was very expensive - but so was everything else in this hotel's class.The check-in was efficient but rather indifferent (a bit surprising given the praise for front desk staff in previous reviews). The room was fine: certainly not huge, probably average by Chicago standards. I found it dark, particularly because most of the wallpaper was grey or charcoal. It was nicely outfitted, though, with a loveseat and large ottoman, plenty of power outlets, and a Keurig coffeemaker. (Unfortunately, I was only provided with one pod for regular coffee.)The free continental breakfast left by the elevators in the mornings was a disappointment quality-wise, but at least the free wifi was reliable and a decent speed.Biggest plus for this property: Definitely the location. Biggest negative: The street noise, particularly the loud music at local bars. I was on the second floor and could even hear arguments between people in the alley that my room overlooked. You'll definitely want to ask for a higher floor!",nan,nan,ta_s1492
trip_advisor,"I was staying for a convention and was very pleased with the hotel and the surrounding neighborhood. Everything you need is nearby. It is a few blocks from red and blue line stops. Very friendly and helpful hotel staff - superior to what one usually gets. Another distinguishing feature is the availability of food and bottled water - they don't nickel and dime you at Kinzie. Breakfast buffets are out on each floor so very convenient - and very well-stocked with food too. Cookies and water are out in the evening. Great place to stay when you'll be on the go and won't have time to fool with details like that. Also, the rooms are larger than what I usually get in Chicago so for a long convention where you live there 5-6 days that makes a big difference too,",nan,nan,ta_s1493
trip_advisor,"The Kinzie is great boutique hotel in a great neighborhood in the River North Area. It is in walking distance of everything. The rooms have all be remodeled and are very nice. The included buffet breakfast is great and so is the cocktail reception every night. Also, the wifi is included in the room price. And the staff is great and they are all very helpful. I highly recommend this hotel for your next stay in Chicago.",nan,nan,ta_s1494
trip_advisor,"Happily, this hotel is still great under the new name. Breakfast near the elevators every morning and there is a tray in your room so you can easily carry your selections back to your room. Bagels actually were decent all thing considered. They don't have a front desk per se, but a more casual type of area with desks and chairs to check-in. Every one is super friendly and the location is great. It across from Harry Carrys, around the corner from house of Blues and a short walk to Portillos, hard rock and Pizza due for those have to have a deep dish pie and an Italian beef sandwich on every visit to Chicago as I do.",nan,nan,ta_s1495
trip_advisor,"This was a trip to celebrate an anniversary and the hotel was a great choice.Location was perfect, walkable to and from shops and sights.The room was uber modern in a comfortable way, slept really well and no noise.The staff are trained to be professional but to be nice too takes it to another level. Breakfast on each floor is a great idea if you need to be somewhere.Enjoyed the weekend in Chicago, wonderful stay at the Kinzie.",nan,nan,ta_s1496
trip_advisor,"We stayed at the Kinzie hotel for 4 nights just prior to Memorial Day. The hotel is in a great central location; walking distance to the SkyDeck, Millennium Park etc. They offer a basic breakfast on every floor in the morning, self serve, grab and go type of foods like cereal, bagels, hard boiled eggs, coffee, tea. They also offer a cocktail event in the evenings. The staff was very accommodating and friendly.",nan,nan,ta_s1497
trip_advisor,"We stayed here last week while my husband had a meeting at the Merchandise Mart. The location was good for us, close to his meeting, shopping and many dining choices. We had plans for other restaurants already but there are many options in the area. The price was reasonable for the area. The room was clean and bed comfortable. The bathroom toiletries were very nice. It is great to have free wi-fi available. The staff were very nice, always greeting you and providing any information you might need. The breakfast is served out by the elevators so you don't have to go to a dining room. but you then have to eat in your room, that can be good or bad, not sure if I like it. The choices were fine, heavy on bakery and grain items, my husband enjoyed the hard boiled eggs. They had yogurt available. They have a happy hour available which I did check out. They even gave you coins for redeeming alcohol drinks and had a nice assortment of snacks. It was located on the 6th floor in a room with a bar and tables. It was a nice touch but we had other plans. The valet service seemed to take a long time, especially when we were checking out on a Saturday morning. I would look at staying here again due to price and location.",nan,nan,ta_s1498
trip_advisor,"Upon arrival, we passed the car keys to the valet (daily fee) and did not need see the car the entire weekend. We were in town to visit area Universities, find a prom dress, and meet up with friends. The Kinzie met all the requirements: walkability to ""power shopping"", plenty of delicious restaurants/ bars close by, and clean modern rooms with trendy decor. After comparing several websites, calling the Hotel direct gave the best weekend rate, so do your homework. The breakfast (free) on the run is a light buffet bar on each floor. Items such as yogurt, cereal, and bagels. There is also a Managers reception (free) in the evening which was fun for the adults before a night on the town, as we snacked on light appetizers and drinks. The view from our room was another building, which didn't really matter to us. My teens loved the visit.",nan,nan,ta_s1499
trip_advisor,we stayed here at Easter & really cannot faultthe hotel.it's staff though are the real deal & would like tothank Meg for looking after us & giving us a great room overlookingHarry's bar opp.speedy check in by Monica as well who was very pleasant.rooms are really nice & all mods cons including free fast wifi.great idea having breakfast on each floor to take back to room.next time in Chicago we will def stay again.thanks Meg for the Bubbly & choc strawbs as Anniversary gift.JohnDublin,nan,nan,ta_s1500
trip_advisor,"We've stayed at this location may times over the years when known as the Amalfi and have always enjoyed the wonderful service, amenities and perfect location. This was our first visit since the transition to the Kinzie brand and can happily report there is certainly no falloff in quality! Spotless, well decorated rooms; complementary evening reception with hors d'oeuvres and beverages; convenient breakfast on each floor; great wifi reception; and friendly, helpful staff make this a place we'll return to for all our Chicago visits.",nan,nan,ta_s1502
trip_advisor,"We have stayed at this establishment several times, under the Amalfi banner and now the Kinzie name, and service, amenities, comfort and particularly staff are all exceptional regardless of the title. Our visits to Chicago have included stays at numerous Chicago hotels and none can quite compare to the way the Kinzie cares for their guests. We have decided this is the onlly place we will frequent going forward. The location in River North is perfect for restaurants, the Mag Mile and the theater district.Breakfast availability on each floor is highly thoughtful and wonderfully convenient. The variety of choices is greatly appreciated along with the attention to cleanliness and re-stocking of items throughout the morning.The complimentery hors d' oeuvres and cocktails every evening are an amazing perk and, while we are not overly indulgent drinkers ourselves, our friends are exceptionally impressed and we do take advantage of this thoughtful reception.The new makeover is amazing! The rooms have always been good sized and comfortable but we love what the local designers have done with them! The beds are sooo comfortable we didn't want to leave, the bathrooms well designed with dual shower heads and the H2O products very nice. the clean, bright new look is fantastic. We were lucky enough to get our favorite corner room so had plenty of space to spread out in.But the very best thing about the Kinzie is it's people! No one, and I mean no one, takes care of you like Kinzie people! We cannot understand why anyone would want to stay anywhere but here with a staff like the Kinzie has. Melissa, Meg, Jose, Julian, all of the Bellman...and everyone else greets you like family. You are remembered and welcomed every time you return. They will do everything they can...and they do...to make certain your stay is as perfect as possible. Everyone has a most wonderfully sincere attitude that you just do not find anywhere else. We had slipped away for the weekend to be married and these people created, without our asking, a time that we will never forget. But, believe me, you don't have to be celebrating anything special to be treated this way. Every time we've been there we have received the same treatment. Lest you think there are no flaws, of course there have been, but the truth is (and we have been in the hospitality business ourselves so we know this is not always the case) they have been rectified so quickly that they are not worth mentioning. The bottom line is this; the Kinzie is a place we highly, highly recommend....not only on Trip Advisor but also to our friends and family. We sincerely hope you enjoy it as much as we do.",nan,nan,ta_s1503
trip_advisor,This hotel used to be the Amalfi Hotel but recently completed an $85 million renovation and had a grand opening a few weeks prior according to the staff. It is a great boutique hotel close to shopping with free wifi and breakfast on each floor. There's also a complimentary reception each night (though it does have a limited beer menu). I recommend staying above the 2nd floor though to get away from the street noise at night from the bars nearby.,nan,nan,ta_s1504
trip_advisor,"I had the opportunity to stay at the Kinzie and had one of the newly renovated rooms - it was fabulous! I have stayed there many times in the past, and have always been impressed with the attention to detail and friendliness of the front desk staff and the bellmen. The warm friendly welcome and attentiveness hasn't changed - I really like the new upgraded rooms!The best of the past has been retained and and they've added great value as well - I highly recommend the property! Too many restaurants within an easy walk to mention including Harry Carays right across the street. Perfect location, and an amazing value!!",nan,nan,ta_s1505
trip_advisor,"Spent 3 days and all were great. The staff is friendly and helpful and can answer any question you have. The rooms are very nice, just upgraded and a nice size. The hotel is set within walking distance to Mag Mile, the theather district and oh so many restaruants, Harry Careys is across the street and a supurb steak house is 2 doors down. They give you a contential breakfast that is worth the room price alone. They have a managers party each night with free drinks and what they call light snacks, actually it's more like a meal. The drinks are great and all top shelf. I will return. It is well worth the price. I would suggest that you pop the few dollars and get a corner room.",nan,nan,ta_s1506
trip_advisor,"Stayed here from the 7th to 9th April 2014 with two children, 7 & 11. We were able to take advantage of the hotel's reopening deal, which gave a good discount off the standard room rate. The room was very nicely finished and freshly decorated and the beds and bedding were very clean. There was good space and a little sofa under the front window. The blinds were good and we were able to sleep very well.We were given tokens for the early evening welcome drinks and snacks in the bar and the kids drinks were free.We could have parked our car locally for about $30 per night, but paid the extra for valet service, about $56 per night! but they would bring it back and re-park when needed. Parking at attractions was about $20 per day, so used the buses to the museum campus area.Could not fault the breakfast, served by the elevators on each floor and you grabbed what you wanted and returned to your room. Good selection of cereals and Danish pastries. Coffee was very good and were able to grab a coffee to go before we left to explore the city.Hotel was just a block from the river, with Wacker Drive on the other side and a couple of blocks from Michigan Avenue and the Magnificent Mile for the shopping, so could not be faulted.Very please and would stay there again in a flash if in Chicago again.",nan,nan,ta_s1507
trip_advisor,"I planned a short getaway and came across Hotel Kinzie (formally the Almafi) wanted to have some couple time with BF and make some new memories sightseeing in Chi town. This was a bit of a splurge in price but the amenities e.g. Daily breakfast, yummy cookies from a local bakery and a decent signature cocktail reception made it all worthwhile. Initially I was drawn in by the discounted rate advertised as the ""grand reopening"". A lovely stay in chic surroundings with polite staff all the way around. Cheers to Hotel Kinzie, a boutique hotel I look forward to revisiting.",nan,nan,ta_s1508
trip_advisor,"We treated ourselves to an outing in Chicago and were extremely pleased with the accommodations and service at the Amalfi. The first night, our room was on an alley and we were awakened around 4 a.m. with the trash trucks doing their thing. When I asked the woman at the front desk if that occurred every night, she immediately said we will move you to another room and when we came back to the hotel, we were greeted by name by our concierge and told of our new room number. The concierge was also very helpful in suggesting eating establishments. My wife and I like different ethnic foods, and the concierge would say, ""Let me think on that and I will call your room in just a few."" Then he would call, say reservations had been made, and when we came down into the lobby, he gave us a card good for free drinks or desserts. And his suggestions were spot on. Don't forget about the manager's reception every evening with top shelf liquors and excellent hoes-deourves. All in all, I would say the Amalfi, while a little pricy, is well worth the pampering.",nan,nan,ta_s1511
trip_advisor,"We stayed at the Amalfi Hotel over Thanksgiving break. It was a very short walk to the holiday parade which was convenient. It was also close to most of the good shopping, being only a 15 minute walk from Michigan Ave and the Water Tower Place. The rooms were a bit small but had great furniture. Our view was excellent, be sure to ask for a city view upon check in. The best part of our stay was the daily free happy hour from 5-8 consisting of an open bar and appetizers. Talk about fun! The hotel staff were very generous about giving out drink tickets. We had a blast at this hotel, I would definitely stay here again!",nan,nan,ta_s1512
trip_advisor,"We will return to the Amalfi next visit to Chicago. As other reviewers have noted, the location is prime. Just a few blocks from The Loop (where we stayed last visit); we greatly appreciated a central-feeling location without the traffic noise. (Our first instinct is always to stay in a ""downtown"" to get the local feel; the Amalfi satisfied this preference, with the added bonus of less traffic & pedestrian congestion.) Impressive number of restaurants and bars in the area, with great variety to suit all tastes.Other noted pros: - Cocktail hour, which kicks up merriment (and some noise with the fun, so do not stay on the 6th floor if napping at 5:30 without earplugs is your thing). With complimentary drink vouchers upon arrival, we enjoyed a cocktail nightly, along with delicious, fresh hors d'ouevres (copious enough to substitute for a meal one evening). -- Staff was distinctly professional. Our two minor complaints were addressed immediately. (Upon returning home I recalled my irritation that the bathrobes had been scratchy. An email to the hotel later, we were given a generous refund of part of our stay -- a truly outstanding accommodation. I'm certain we would have been given new bathrobes if we had mentioned it at the time; it just didn't irk me until returning home and starting to write my TA review. A semi-functional iHome clock radio/mp3 station -- the power button was stuck -- was rectified while we were out.) The staff's restaurant recommendations were perfect; we ate at each of the three recommended places and each was spot-on; the staff had truly listened to what we were seeking. Housekeeping did not even knock when the ""Zzzz' sign was hung. When we finally did get out for the day, an afternoon tidy-up was effected no problem. And houskeeping was spotless.- Modern design with occasional flourishes; comfortable use of space.- Aveda products. Hotel toiletries do not usually provoke a reaction in me, but I was gratified the hotel uses relatively healthy and not-animal-tested (and yummy!) products.- King-sized bed was comfortable and a two kinds of pillows (for a generous five pillows total) came with.- Fitness room was larger and better stocked than most hotel gyms.Only noted cons:- The rooms in the back of the building face the back of the next block; on the sixth floor, we overlooked a parking lot and rooftops. Lower floors (fourth and below) presumably look into back windows. That being said, we enjoyed the Chicago-y high rise view beyond the rooftops. Kinzie Street along the front of the hotel is not particularly busy (ok, this from a Manhattanite) but the old view-versus-quiet conundrum definitely applies to the second, third, and fourth floors. We had NO noise problems (three days, three nights) from the alley that divides the two buildings.- Like most new American hotels, the windows do not open. The ventilation system was not ideal, and the room felt stuffy. Caveat: We did not try all the A/C settings. There may well have been a ""fan"" setting in addition to the ""heat"" and ""off"" settings that we did use. But if you are prone to feelings of discomfort in a stuffy room, it's worth checking in with the hotel about whether their ventilation system draws in outside air or recycles building or room air. It was just never very fresh. Also, in the wintertime consider bringing a travel humidifier. Other new American hotels have not bothered me like this did.All in all, a fun time on a couples trip. See you next time, Amalfi!",nan,nan,ta_s1513
trip_advisor,"It was my first visit to Chicago, and glad I picked the Amalfi. Location was great, near Magnificent Mile for shopping, and within 20min walk of major tourist places (Millennium Park, John Hancock tower, Navy Pier etc). Great places to eat close by, runs parallel to Hubbard St.Staff were extremely helpful, providing me with maps and tourist info.Complimentary breakfast served every floor, had to take back to room to eat, but nice touch. Nightly reception on 6th floor (between 5.30 to 7pm), given vouchers for 2 free drinks per night.My room was on 4th floor at back, view over street, relatively quiet. Room was OK in size, bed comfortable, temperature control was handy. Bathroom OK too, Aveda products were great. Kept very clean, though it wasn't cleaned until after 5pm on first day.Lobby is fairly small but comfortable.Would definitely recommend it, and will stay there again, great value though understand hotel is being renovated and renamed in March 2014 (Kinzie Hotel), so hope price doesn't rise too much.",nan,nan,ta_s1514
trip_advisor,"I escorted a group from Kansas City and could not have found a better location and property. The staff go well beyond the imaginable, the hotel is maintained in tip-top shape and the complimentary continental breakfast and evening cocktail party is such a bonus.I highly recommend this hotel for individual or group travel. The staff have all been trained to accommodate the guest first and ask questions second. Pricing is extremely fair and reasonable for a boutique hotel within walking distance of many Chicago standards.",nan,nan,ta_s1515
trip_advisor,"The location is absolutely perfect for visiting the town. Close to restaurants, pubs, metro station, departure for cruises on the river and just in front of the 'House of Blues'!We had a very nice room with a very confortable king-size bed, nice and clean bathroom completed with the very good Aveda products.Absolutely great the idea of the 'happy hour' everyday from six to eight, coming back from a busy visiting day and getting a break before heading out for dinner: friendly staff and delicious buffet.We also appreciated the breakfast at the floor: one can step out of the room in pijamas, grab a cup of coffee and feel at home...of course one can also seat in the lounge and enjoy a nice start of the day!Perfect hotel in Chicago!",nan,nan,ta_s1516
trip_advisor,"For all the reasons I loved the hotel the first time around, the second time was even better. This time I was with my wife and we were extremely happy with our stay. The location is perfect and all of the amenities you would expect at a top notch hotel are here at the Amalfi.The staff, the concierge, the valets - all very helpful. The concierge helped me score Bears tickets.The convenience of the breakfast set up is great. But the best is still the nightly cocktail hours. When drinks are flowing in a packed room it makes for a good time and fun to mingle with other people.When in Chicago you must stay at the Amalfi.",nan,nan,ta_s1517
trip_advisor,"We had a great experience at Amalfi.PROS:Localization - close to metro stations, to Loop, to Michigan Avenue, to Chicago river... Very convenient. Lots of restaurants nearby.Room - good size. We spent 10 nights at Amalfi and had lots of luggage, and the room has enough space to accommodate everything. Quiet (our room faced the back of the hotel - although the view was so so, it was quiet). Bed is confortable, shower is great. Aveno products available.Breakfast - selfservice at a lobby- you can eat it at your room. Fruits (banana, orange and apple), breads, coffee, yogurt, eggs, cheese, pastries, milk, tea, cereals, juices (orange and cranberries) available. Suggestion: include honey sachets, hot milk and forks.The hotel offers complimentary drinks (alcoholic and non alcoholic) at night for the guests. Very friendly.We had an early checkout (noon) at no cost, and a late checkout at the cost of U$ 10,00 for each additional hour.We had at the Amalfi a great reception and the staff is very eager to meet your needs.CONS:Parking at the hotel is very expensive. We rented a car for one day and prefered to return it the same day. CONCLUSION:Would return, definetely!!",nan,nan,ta_s1518
trip_advisor,"Stayed in the Amalfi for the second time, the last trip was six years ago, we were happy then and six years on, delighted to have stayed there again.Its location is super, Michigan Avenue is a few minutes walk away and go across the bridge near the hotel you are on the Southside!!Checkin was stress free and the lady on the desk, could not have been more accommodating. A nice bonus staying here is that you get vouchers (tickets) for drinks each evening in the Ravello Lounge is on the 6th floor, we stayed on the 6th floor, so drinks were close any evening we were in!! We had a corner room and everything was great, from all the lovely toiletries, towels and bedding, the room was really comfortable, great for relaxing after long days wandering around Chicago.Breakfast is help yourself in the morning, on each floor near the lifts, being awake early due to jet lag, the 6.30 start was great, pastries, cereals, bagels, breads, fruit and drinks, didn't need much more.Across the road is Harry Carrays bar, great for sports and food, so location again brilliant.For value this is one of the best places I have stayed in. Would I go back...yes, no problem.There are loads of good places to eat close by, the Amalfi ticked all the boxes for me.",nan,nan,ta_s1519
trip_advisor,"This was our first visit to Chicago. Staff at the Amalfi made it that much more enjoyable. They were very helpful with our sightseeing arrangements, rooms were clean, breakfast got us off to a good start and their friendliness made our stay a good experience. We all thought this hotel gave us good value at this price point. It's close to many great restaurants, shopping the magnificient mile and the Navy Pier. Our only negative was a noisy wedding party in the next room which kept us up for 2 nights. Thought that the hotel should monitor each floor for disruptions throughout the night. Yes, we should have called the front desk as they assured us they would've responded.",nan,nan,ta_s1522
trip_advisor,The Amalfi lived up to all the hype. It was my adult daughters' birthday and Magan made sure we had a great room on the 6th floor with a lovely treat delivered to our room shortly after arrival. Very comfortable bed and pillows and loads of fluffy towels. Loved the plush robes that allowed us to go out to the elevator area in the morning to pick up a substantial continental breakfast and take it back to our room. The Ravello lounge with a free drink and nibbles was a nice touch. All the staff was pleasant and helpful but a special shout out to Magan and Julian who always made me laugh. Would definitely return to this hotel. We were able to walk to most places.,nan,nan,ta_s1523
trip_advisor,"We stayed there two nights. The room was spacious, quiet and comfortable. It was super clean for you clean freaks out there. The morning breakfast was pretty decent. The lobby is very small, and has a sit down desk check in which was a nice touch. The hotel staff was helpfull on directing us to restaurants and getting around. All in al this is a great value considering its great location. The best thing I can say is that its location makes it convienient, but out of the insane intensity of the Navy pier and Michagan avenue chaos. It was a great place to stay.",nan,nan,ta_s1524
trip_advisor,"I stayed at the Amalfi in September of 2013 and was blown away! This hotel is amazing - they've thought of every detail to make the guest experience exceptional. When you check-in, you're given a ticket for a complimentary cocktail at their nightly reception, which I welcomed after a long day of traveling and being in meetings. Every morning each floor has an extensive breakfast display, with a variety of cereals, bagels, muffins, coffee, tea, etc. I was expecting a ""standard"" continental breakfast display, this was above and beyond. It was easy to grab something as I was on my way to more meetings - again, very much appreciated. The hotel itself was modern, clean, well-maintained - absolutely no complaints. My room and bathroom were clean, the bed was very comfy. The only thing is that the hotel is only 6 floors, so if you're looking for a city view, you probably won't get it. The location was convenient, the doorman was even able to get us a cab quickly during the height of rush hour! All other staff were friendly and helpful too.I'd highly recommend this hotel to anyone traveling to Chicago and look forward to staying there again.",nan,nan,ta_s1525
trip_advisor,"Picked this place after reading others reviews and we are glad we did. Their weekend rate was quite reasonable considering its great location. We were able to walk to dinner and to the theatre. Parking of course was extra and not cheap but this is Chicago. The room was nice, very comfortable king size bed with luxurious linens. We stopped for the free cocktail and appetizers before heading out and were really surprised at how nice this was. Breakfast was also a nice added touch with quite a selection and being on each floor made it easy to run out for another cup of coffee or danish. Used the exercise room only because it was raining and found it to be adequate. Will definitely return!",nan,nan,ta_s1526
trip_advisor,"We stayed at the Amalfi Hotel in September. I was there to attend a conference and had my husband join me for the weekend to shop and enjoy Chicago before it began. I choice this hotel because it was a much better value than the hotel where the conference was being held. I was really glad that I did. Very welcoming staff, cocktail hour with appetizers and a free drink ticket every night, and a breakfast buffet on every floor in the morning. What is not to like? The room was on the small side but very clean and well appointed with robes, coffee maker and a tray for bringing breakfast items back to your room in the morning. The location is great as well. It is a block from the river and walking distance to all the normal tourist sites and highly rated restaurants. Great stay and value.",nan,nan,ta_s1527
trip_advisor,"Booked a suite on the 6th floor; the Hotel has business offices above the 6th floor. They offer valet parking but its pricey (don't exactly remember how much) but there are plenty of garages near by. The area is walking distance to the river walk, lake, Grant Park, and endless views of architectural titans looming over the river and beyond. The neighborhood is safe and fun for the young and up. Chops, dry aged steaks and excellent wine and service is found in the immediate and nearby areas, however be prepared to pay $$$. Ah the hotel, all the staff we met were friendly, always smiling, gracious, and ready to take care of their guests. The hotel is quaint and not overwhelming like large scale hotels. Our suite was clean, roomy, quiet, with nice views of the downtown skyline. The bed was very comfortable, plush, and we slept quite well. We had a few friends stay over one night at which time we were provided with a fold-out bed which was comfortable enough. The evening hosted cocktail service offers 2 free drinks per guest, ranging from domestic and imported wines, beers, and cocktails-spirits. Its a sociable event and not too crowded. The complimentary continental breakfast offered us fresh fruits, cereals, coffee, teas, pastries, hard boiled eggs, yogurt and more. The Amalfi Hotel is not a high-end hotel, but we felt we got more value for our money while maintaining a solid notch above the rest. We would definitely stay again, Thank You Amalfi!",nan,nan,ta_s1528
trip_advisor,"Breakfast every morning, served on every floor in the elevator lobby 'buffet style'. We found it was plenty to get us going ... and loved that you can take the food to your room.Then, in the evening, a reception including charcuterie, cheese, breads AND a free cocktail or beer or wine. A nice appetizer before dinner on the town.Luxury, boutique hotel. Very well maintained. Love the check-in at a desk instead of standing at a counter. All the staff are super-friendly and helpful.And you can walk to all of the major attractions/buildings/restaurants, or hop on transit.We bought a package that included valet parking with in/out privileges ... stayed five nights and didn't use the car once.Fabulous. Highly recommended!",nan,nan,ta_s1529
trip_advisor,"We looked around a lot for hotels in Chicago before booking this one and we made the right choice for sure. This was the first time my wife had even been to Chicago and I wanted the hotel to be upper level as it would be her first contact with the city. The Amalfi did not disappoint at all. We let them know we were coming for our (very) belated honeymoon (11 years later) and the first thing that greeted us was champagne and chocolate dipped strawberries in the room. Maybe even better than that though was the wonderful personalized card we got. It was an outstanding first impression. The room was clean, the sheets were soft, the bed was comfortable and our room location was ideal. We were on the 5th floor in 528 and right outside the window was a view of Harry Caray's restaurant which as a Cubs fan made me smile. The room was a great size and was not cramped or crowded at all. My sister stayed on the other side of the hotel and her room was great as well. The staff could not have been any better. From the front desk to the cleaning crew everyone was friendly and willing to help. Major shout out to everyone there. The location was great. We were able to walk to so many places. Of course we like walking so that may not be for everyone. For the further locations like Wrigley Field and the Museum of Science and Industry it is a short walk to the public transportation system that will get you anywhere. We got free drink certificates for the bar on the 6th floor as well and wish we would have had time to use more of them. Chicago has a tendency to make you lose track of time though and we never seemed to be at the hotel during the time we could use them unfortunately. It is a nice touch though, and the snacks they put out were delicious. The only drawback I can see for some people is there isn't a pool or bar that is open late. But for us this was a non-issue as we were there to enjoy the city and didn't have to pay for amenities we were not going to use. Because of this the price was even better than you would expect considering what you get and we are already planning, and looking forward to staying there again on our next trip to the Windy City. Hopefully sooner than later!",nan,nan,ta_s1530

trip_advisor,"My wife and I have stayed here several times most recently over Labor Day weekend...this is not a large chain hotel but rather an European style boutique hotel...rooms are clean, decent size and the bathroom we've always had is quite large with ample space on the lavatory for yoru personal items...the continental breakfast on each floor offers 'peeled' fruits, cold cereal, rolls, doughnuts, toast, yogurt...not extensive but certainly enough...not mainly hotels in this area offer a 'comp' breakfast...a 'comp' Happy Hour each evening in a small 6th floor lounge provides one complimentary drink and 'munchies'...previously the drinks were endless but this has changed so either the hotel is doing so well financially it no longer has to entice with unlimited drinks or is not doing well and can no longer afford endless alcohol..who knows??...nonetheless it's still a nice perk!...the location is excellent in the River North area just two blocks from Michigan Avenue and Mag Mile shopping...a vareity of restaurants are just steps from the front door...if you go down the street a few blocks to the Sterling parking garage on the corner of Kinzie and Clark the price is much cheaper than hotel valet...the staff is friendly, check in is a breeze and elevator service is prompt compared to larger hotels...all in all, we've never had a bad experience so highly recommend this hotel property!",nan,nan,ta_s1533
trip_advisor,"My son, friend, and her daughter all stayed at the Amalfi hotel for four days in mid August. The hotel was clean, close to everything, and the staff was excellent. Yes, some of the furniture in the lobby had very small rips in the leather (or vinyl?), but it was all spotless! We were met with smiles, and constant offers of assistance. I had just broken my foot, and was in a wheelchair for most of the trip. The Amalfi staff were very accomodating, and extremely helpful when it came to arranging cab service with the extra space for my chair. We arrived too early to check our bags into our room, and upon leaving we also had nowhere to put our bags while we hit a few last minute tourist attractions. The hotel graciously held all 7 of our bags (I did mention that three of us were ladies, right? Hence the 7 bags for 4 days...) while we completed our trip. Breakfast on the floor was such a plus, and even though the variety was small, it was certainly enough to satisfy everyone! Cocktail hour was fantastic, and we met folks from France, New Orleans, Kentucky, and a few other places. The bar room is a bit small, but really it just forced us to talk to strangers, and it made the trip that much more interesting. I had been corresponding with one of the staff at the hotel previous to our arrival, and she helped to make our trip ten times better. A very big thank you to Ms. Bertetto - you deserve a pat on the back from the management there - before I even arrived I knew I had found my favourite place to stay!!! I've travelled often, stayed at Four Seasons, Fairmonts, and many other places. I believe the Amalfi beats them all with their uniqueness, proximity to attractions, and the dynamics of the staff.. The only complaint I have is one. After we left on the first day we had slept there to explore, we came back to a room that had barely been touched. I was a little surprised by that. BUT it was only once, and the room was kept neat and tidy for the next three days. KAC from Sarnia, Ontario",nan,nan,ta_s1534
trip_advisor,"We booked the hotel for 7 nights through Hotwire secret hot rate and specified we were a family with a teenager. Apparently, we were booked for a King bed. The hotel wanted to charge us additional $ to switch to two queens. Most hotels we have booked through Expedia and Hotwire (and even priceline) have always accommodated a request for two doubles but the Amalfi charges extra for it's two queen beds, even though it is the same size room as it's King bed room. However, after much wrangling with the hotel management based on just the principle that we had specified we would be three people in all and a teenager can't be expected to share a bed with parents - they moved us a two queens beds after the first night at no extra charge. Even so, we were paying almost $190 per night after taxes and fees.The management did send us a letter of apology and complimentary cookies & drink the second night.The hotel itself is highly recommended. The beds are very comfortable and room was clean. The complimentary breakfast is adequate to get you started and convenient since it's on each floor. The hotel also has complimentary Wi-fi. We did not use the parking so cannot comment on that. The location could not be better - we walked to quite a few sights and connections to most EL lines is just few blocks from hotel. There are also many restaurants nearby. Despite the unpleasantness with the bed type and the slight tension due to that (not a great feeling for a vacation), I would recommend this hotel based on the location and room and the fact the hotel did resolve our request satisfactorily at our insistence. Though I would ensure that the room is booked via a service that allows to specify the bed type since the rates are different.",nan,nan,ta_s1535
trip_advisor,"We have just returned home from Chicago. We stayed at the Amalfi Hotel from August 20 to August 24. The location was perfect for us. We had booked the Hop on-Hop off bus. The spots for pick up were close to the hotel. The hotel is convenient to restaurants and the downtown area. Upon arriving at the Amalfi the staff were very friendly and helpful. Our friends had arrived the day before and the staff made sure we were in the same floor as them. Each day we returned after seeing the sites, we were always greeted by all staff in the front foyer with a smile and ""how was your day"".A breakfast was provided every morning. Just by the elevator on each floor there were bagels, muffins, cereal, juice, coffee, tea and milk. Breakfast was to be eaten in the comfort of your room. Each evening from 6:00 to 8:00 pm on the sixth floor in a ""lounge room"" there were hors d'ouvers and drinks offered at no expense to the guests. Complimentary drink tickets were given upon arrival. It was a nice way to relax for awhile before going out again for the evening.Wake up calls, assistance and information were all given in a very friendly manner. We would definitely recommend this hotel to family and friends.A most enjoyable stay.",nan,nan,ta_s1536
trip_advisor,"I booked directly on the Amalfi website for a two night stay in a deluxe King nonsmoking room for two adults and a 10 year old. The cost was $429 before taxes. I asked for a 5th or 6th floor room facing the city because I had read the reviews. The reservation supervisor assured us 8 days before our trip that the desk staff makes their very best effort to meet such requests. We were given a room (room 212) on the second floor. Our room was so small they could not fit in a roller bed for our daughter. They offered us a room that could take a roller bed for $25 per night extra; however this room was also on the second floor and would have us facing a brick wall across an alley where homeless people meet (read other reviews). We decided not to accept this ""upgrade"". At that point our consolation was that at least the room was not as noisy as described in other reviews, but that was before the night. The night noises from the street were very loud and kept our daughter awake most of the night. It also did not help that the room was constantly cold and the air conditioning control unit was ineffective. The room carpet and bathroom tiles are of a color designed not to show dirt, however along with the room window, they were noticeably either dirty, stained or grimy. The bathroom ceiling clearly needs repair.The furniture in the room were flimsy and chipped. The furniture in the public areas on the second and fifth floor (where the gym is) are also chipped. The TV is not high definition and is appropriately sized for such a small room.A faint putrid smell during the free breakfast should have warned me not to go early morning jostling for the rancid eggs, which eventually left me with an upset stomach. It was not all bad though, there was great weather and we visited nice restaurants and many attractions. This hotel is within walking distance to many Chicago attractions. Wifi was good and and the gym was nice (at night). In summary I did not have to apologize too much to my wife and daughter for making such a poor choice of an hotel as the other aspects of the trip covered up.",nan,nan,ta_s1537
trip_advisor,"We recently booked this hotel through Hotwire and got a very good price. I hadn't checked the hotel out before as it was always a bit above our budget. So I was pleasantly surprised when I booked this and read all the fabulous reviews. My daughter picked Chicago as our annual road trip so we drove into the heart of the city and it was very easy to get to the hotel. When pulling up for the valet parking pull up in front of the front doors as there is also a private valet service just at the corner and this is not part of the hotel. Check in was fabulous and they unloaded our car and took our bags up to our room. The rooms are not overly large but with so much to see and do in the city there is little time to spend n the room. We were lucky enough to be on the 6th floor, just beside the elevator, which you could not hear once inside your room. The hospitality room where they serve happy hour was just down the hall and was a fabulous treat. Breakfast is put out every morning just outside the elevators and we could slip out every morning in our pj's and robes to help ourselves. The selection of food was fantastic and was more then enough! The hotel is in just the right location and made it very easy to get to all the sites and eateries. I highly recommend a restaurant not too far from the hotel called Centro, it was fabulous! they serve homestyle so order a couple of dishes and share them. We also had stuffed pizza at Giordanis and it was delicious. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at the hotel and loved the city of Chicago.",nan,nan,ta_s1538

Check-in and -out is efficient and fast (maybe a given in USA bu I live in China...and for you who travel to China, you know what I mean..)Rooms are ""just right"", clean (but this is a given for me in USA), bathroom is relatively large when compared to the room and amenities are good quality (Aveda). I loved the choice of sweets and nuts offered in the room. The breakfast is quite peculiar as it is self-service by the elevator at each floor, with a good choice of muffins, bakery, cereals, yogurts etcthe gym is small but well equipped.The bar offers complimentary drinks during happy hours...very crowded..so I guess people like it.",nan,nan,ta_s1539

trip_advisor,"Lets start with the pros:- very helpfull staff.- good location.- well sized rooms- free wifi- enjoyed the nightly cocktail session with a couple of free drinks each night...pretty good quality cocktails too!- enough free breakfast to het you started.But one big negative. We booked a king size corner room which at face value was great, until we decided to sleep. The room we had for the first night was next to a building where the industrial strenght aircon. vent blasted at a loud noise all night. In addition, being a corner room there are copious windows and the way the curtains are set up, you just cant keep the sunlight out. Bottom line was that notwithstanding the size and comfort of the bed, we were awake at 6:30am after a very ordinaty nights sleep. We requested a room change the next day which was accommodated, but we still had the same light problems, with more sleep noise. So whilst this hotel ticks a lot of boxes, bottom line is that if you dont get a good nights sleep, this devalues the overall experience. So you just need to be carefull the type of room you book.",nan,nan,ta_s1542

You're close to lots of restaurants and the Magnificent Mile and you're right at the foot of the State Street Bridge to reach all the sights in the Loop (architecture tours, museums, parks). The cons: Can't think of any!",nan,nan,ta_s1544

trip_advisor,"My Girlfriend and I had a couple days off and wanted to take a trip to the city and after shopping around by price and quality I ended up booking a last minute trip to Amalfi. I had never stayed or even heard of the brand but took a chance. Upon arriving the thing that stood our the most was the Fedora hats that the male staff wore, It suited the decor and feel of Amalfi perfectly and was something that could be cheesy if not done right but I loved them. The lobby was very modern and made great use of the space, check in was extremely easy and very personal. Our ""Experience Designer"" also had great suggestions for dinner. The only part i found off was how they just kind of thrust 2 bottles of water at you saying they are complimentary etc. I declined them and went up to the room where they had more water for 5$ a bottle. I would be nicer if there were 2 bottles in the room .The Room was very nice, modern, well kept. The bed was extremely comfortable, Cd's were provided in the room for light music and Dvd rentals were complimentary if we were just looking to relax. The directory was also very helpful to learn a bit about what's in the area. The 2 things i feel that could be improved on is the A/C was alright but it only went down to i think 70 and the room could have used a walk in shower more than the shower/tub.Breakfast and Cocktails were included as well, both tastefully done and relaxing. Breakfast is set up on each floor as a help yourself via the tray in the room, a very light healthy breakfast or start to the day. The cocktails and appetizers in their lounge is great for socializing and for the winding down at the end up of the day. Overall I really enjoyed my stay and will probably be back, next time I may book a suite and see how that is.",nan,nan,ta_s1547
trip_advisor,"I recently spent a long weekend at the Amalfi with my daughter for a special occasion. The lovely and incredibly convenient breakfast on your own floor each morning, the excellent 3 hour cocktail reception each day, free wifi and free local calls in a charming, extremely well situated hotel - makes this hotel hard to beat. Service is exceptional (aside from very friendly and helpful front staff, we came back to our room the first night to find a beautiful bottle of wine and two glasses awaiting us for a special birthday - in addition, a key left behind resulted in numerous calls from Erika from Customer Service who helped to retrieve it and who was a great pleasure to deal with). We did get a very good rate from Travelzoo ($139/night) but as long as this hotel continues to provide reasonable rates - this will be our ""go to"" hotel for our trips to Chicago. We loved it, have recommended it to others, and look forward to returning to the great city of Chicago and to this fabulous hotel. There's a reason the Amalfi receives so many good reviews - they are very well deserved.",nan,nan,ta_s1548

I enjoyed the complimentary happy hour, which was pleasantly packed. I met travelers from all over the world. The hotel, at least on this particular weekend, seemed to attract a European crowd. The room itself was spacious and comfortable. The continental breakfast was above average and just down the hall. Truly a pleasant stay.

The only way to make it better was to turn it off. - Room was not clean enough. Dust buildup in corners.

trip_advisor,"We went to Chicago for a quick get-away to celebrate our anniversary. The Intercontinental was not our first choice - the hotel we've used in the past has changed ownership. As a side note, IHG Reservations was very helpful in resolving the issues I had making the reservation. Now back to the hotel. Firstly, this is a big hotel and the prices are about what you'd expect from a property located in absolutely ""prime real estate"" in Chicago. However, check in, even at 10:45 AM, was friendly and efficient. I was informed our room was unfortunately.not ready, but we were directed to the bell stand to check our luggage and that I would receive a text message when it was ready. (Note: I never did receive a text.) The elevators are initially confusing - one set serves half the floors & the other set serves the rest. Fortunately, during high usage times there is a person standing by to assist guests find the right elevator bank to use. The room was spacious and clean. The bed was comfortable and the pillows were to our liking. The room had darkening shades which worked very well. Overall, the room was nicely appointed and comfortable. The hotel was hosting at least one large conference but the halls were quiet, and housekeeping was efficient. Hotel staff - front desk, bell, restaurant, concierge - were all courteous, efficient, knowledgable, and friendly. The hotel's location is excellent - close to restaurants, shopping, and an easy cab ride to all museums. Would I stay here again? Yes, but if all you want is clean and safe, there are other hotels in Chicago, although not as conveniently located.",nan,nan,ta_s1552
trip_advisor,"There is nothing to recommend this hotel. Fair rooms, amenities and the lobby/bar is an absolute zoo at night. You can easily do better for the money. Fit and finish-bathroom, sheets, towels, etc were middle brow at best. 500 Michigan Ave location is convenient to to the Loop business district but somehow the Intercontinental manages to be on a block without nice restaurants of shopping (there is a Mens Wearhouse across the street).",nan,nan,ta_s1553
trip_advisor,"This is a historical marvel, with it's really quite beautiful. Centrally located on Michigen Avenue, just a few blocks from Navy Pier, the water taxi stand, and the 360 Chicago (formerly known as the John Hancock Observatory). The rooms are nicely appointed, CLEAN, the beds are heaven, and the pool is a site to behold. Stayed one night with my daughter for a Spring Break Staycation. We did order room service for dinner, and the delivery was smooth, our food presented, and tip included in the charges (so much nicer than awkwardly handing over cash). Great sized portions, we just split it so we wouldn't waste/have leftovers. Comes from Michael Jordan's downstairs and it is very good.We ordered an in-room movie and were dismayed to find that when we had to leave with 1/2 the movie leftover, it was irretrievable without purchasing twice. This wasn't made clear with purchase, really. There was a confusing blurb about the subject, but we read it to mean it was available for 24 hours from purchase. Apparently it's available for ONE viewing per 24 hours. Ridiculous in my opinion for such a high-caliber hotel.Complimentary WiFi with IHG membership. Fast and readily available. Check in and concierge wonderful. Everyone is very very polite and helpful, without being intrusive. Umbrellas are available for rain, which I thought was a wonderful touch. We were always assisted in hailing cabs.Probably won't be back only because with that kind of cost, it's not really practical. There are equally well-placed hotels with more amenities. The showers in the ""spa/health club"" were being worked on so there was construction debris everywhere & there is only one small hot sauna room available. They should really expand the ""health club"" to be an ACTUAL full-service spa and then it would really be worth the hyped up price. Overall, worth a stay to enjoy the pool at least once- especially when it's cold and dreary outside.",nan,nan,ta_s1554
trip_advisor,"The title says it all! This was a great hotel in of the most perfect spots of the Magnificent Mile. I was able to take the Blue Line to the Red Line from the airport for a total cost of $5.00. I felt as though I was a Chicagoan and was only a little more than a block away from the hotel. I was able to walk through the mall and there was the Intercontinental Hotel. It is very close to the river, walk down the opposite direction and you have shopping for days. You have everything from Saks Fifth Avenue, Banana Republic, Cheesecake Factory, Nike town and many other stores you can enjoy. I enjoyed walking at night and felt very comfortable. The Chicago police officers were out in the streets so didn't have a fear at all. Also was able to find the Lamborghini and Rolls Royce shop so I was doing some major window shopping. I would recommend this hotel for the cool rooms with comfortable beds. I will include some photos from the room and the top floors for you to see. Enjoy.",nan,nan,ta_s1555
trip_advisor,"The Intercontinental in Chicago is an expensive hotel with lots of meeting space. The staff is about average-not rude, not particulary pleasant or welcoming. There is no lobby, which is annoying since there are many meetings in session at the same time and no place to sit down or network. Even though I hadn't requested it, I got an handicapped room that was very large-too large to see the TV from the bed. The room was spartan or minimalist and completely devoid of warmth. The handicapped walk-in shower seemed like a good idea until there was actually water running in and then regardless of how careful I was, water, got all over the bathroom floor. Using the water-saving toilet was also problematic-not once did the paper do down with the flush. There were several lamps in the room but since it was so large, it was difficult to see most of the room. The food sources in the hotel were not impressive-a steakhouse and a dirty overcrowded Starbucks. In general I found the hotel to be uncomfortable and not anyplace I wanted to do anything in beside sleep-if there had been another alternative, I would have switched hotels.My room was over $400/night, a price I would never pay for this hotel again. Definitely not worth the price. The location was great and it was easy to walk anywhere. In summary, this hotel is not nearly as nice as it thinks it is.


Green Features: Good practices, but not very workable. Also, replaced all towels even though they were not on the floor or in the tub. Did that for 3 days.",nan,nan,ta_s1556

You can't beat the Michigan Ave location.Perhaps we looked a bit disgruntled when checking in, because the front desk gave us a room with two beds when we had requested just one (whatever, more space to put me things). The room was one of the biggest I've seen in Chicago, and the bathroom was really nice as well. The bed was comfortable and everything seemed fairly clean.The hotel has a really nice fitness center, and my boyfriend loved the lap pool, which a staff member told us used to belong to a men's club. My only complaint is that when I ripped a hole in my shirt, and called down for a sewing kit/needle and thread, I was told to come down to reception. I went down and asked again for a sewing kit, and was told that housekeeping handles that sort of thing. The receptionist called a house keeper and told me it would only be a few moments. After a few minutes, someone from housekeeping came up, spoke with the receptionist, and then disappeared. After a few more minutes I asked if everything was going okay, and received a nod. About 20 minutes passed before I gave up and left. Not really a big deal, just kind of weird.",nan,nan,ta_s1558
trip_advisor,"This is renewed hotel where what matters the most is the location.Really close to all Chicago's must see and must do's. We only needed to take a taxi going from and to the airport, everywhere else we went walking.Nice small room, we were in the last floor and the water pressure was not good. The A/C was too loud so we turned it off, Chicago's weather it's better now so we could do that.Helpful staff but nothing exceptional.There is a Starbucks in the lobby but is crowded at morning and late afternoon. Just crossing Michigan Avenue there's a Walgreens where you can buy anything you need.The Michael Jordan restaurant is in the lobby too but there are so many really good restaurants in the area that we didn't go.Everything is good in this hotel, but the location is absolutely great!! Super recommended for short or long stays in Chicago.",nan,nan,ta_s1559
trip_advisor,"Hotel is nothing special. We expected a nice hotel in The InterContinental brand. Our room was fairly large but sparsely appointed. The bathroom had no counter space and very poor lighting. Lobby was cozy and the staff very friendly. Elevators were quick, never had to wait. We'd stay here again if the rate was a great deal but we wouldn't pay a premium rate. It's in a great location on Michigan Ave with great shopping and restaurants.",nan,nan,ta_s1560
trip_advisor,"We stayed here in March, mixing a business trip with a visit to the city.Hotel service was very good, staff efficient and helpful.We had a lovely room on 34th floor, great views.The location is perfect for seeing the city by bus, water or on foot.Breakfast was the usual hotel buffet but good selection of well prepared food.Had to pay for wifi and the fitness centre, although the pool was free.",nan,nan,ta_s1561
trip_advisor,"We enjoy staying at the Intercontinental Hotel - Chicago. Rooms are of better than average size, very clean, and comfortable. The location on Michigan Ave. is ideal for travel as this puts you in the heart of the downtown area. Eno - the wine bar - is excellent with the bartender very knowledgeable in a wide variety of wines from around the world.The cocktail bar is always crowded and noisy. Cocktail choice and their preparation needs improvement. Ingredients need to be measured for consistency.We tend not to eat in the restaurant so cannot comment - too many other from which restaurants to choose.Will stay there again.",nan,nan,ta_s1562
trip_advisor,"I have stayed in this hotel several times, the most recent being in December of 2014. My only complaint is that the front desk is usually overwhelmed with the check in process. We arrived after noon and had to leave our bags due to the room not being ready. When we returned at 5 pm, there was a huge line to check in and an even longer wait for our bags. Those are the negatives. The hotel is a beautiful hotel . The pool is an absolute must see! It is worth going to take a look. Our room was nicely furnished and clean. I have always been happy with the rooms we have had. The elevators are quick and the location is wonderful for the Chicago sights. I like that it is situated between the North Michigan Avenue shopping and still not that far from the State Street shopping and Theater district. However, we like to walk! The bell staff and concierge are always very helpful. There is a Starbucks, a Walgreens and even a McDonald's very close. Other very nice restaurants are plentiful. I usually use a third party booking company and am never disappointed if we stay at the Intercontinental.",nan,nan,ta_s1563
trip_advisor,"We were taking a girl's family trip (3 generations) to Chicago, and the location of the Intercontinental couldn't be beat! The beds were comfy, and the room was satisfactory, although our view was of some kind of tank and pipes coming out of it. But the customer service at the front desk left something to be desired. When we tried to check in (a prepaid reservation with a third party), they only had one room for us instead of two. When I showed the confirmation for two rooms, the lady said that she would have to talk to her manager. She came back 10-15 minutes later, and said that they would go ahead and give us the room. Then at checkout, I asked that a $19.95 internet charge be removed since we had not used it. She argued first that I had to have entered my room number and last name. I told her to check the last name, because it wasn't mine, since I didn't do it and didn't use their internet (except for in the business center where it cost .40/minute). Both times the matter was resolved, but with the attitude like I was trying to get away with something. No, ""Sorry for the misunderstanding. Let me take care of that for you."" The front desk could use a little more training in customer service.",nan,nan,ta_s1564
trip_advisor,"Was very pleased with how quickly we got checked in and to our room.We were early by a couple hours and just for fun I wanted to check to make sure they had our information and they did so we ended up getting our room three hours earlier than expected. We enjoyed the room. The bed was comfortable, had a decent view out from front of hotel on the 18th floor. The bathroom was nicely designed and and clean. I can't saying anything bad about the service we received for sure. I do think the carpet in the hallways was weird. The original color looks like it is blue, but there is sploshes of green coming from the walls everywhere. It may be the design of the floor, but it looks nasty and almost like mold. Perception is reality to most. We loved the stay and our trip and will definitely be back and will be staying at intercontinental Chicago because of the great service, great price, and great location to everything.",nan,nan,ta_s1565
trip_advisor,"Although I will say that the service at the Hotel Interncontinenal Chicago was exceptional - everything you would expect from a hotel of this class, the building itself is starting to show it's age.We had an interesting discussion about the new carpeting in the Historic Tower where we stayed; the carpeting appeared to be designed to look like old, worn cobblestones overgrown with moss, but it ended up looking like really badly worn and faded carpeting that badly needed to be replaced.I was so shocked by the appearance when I got out of the elevator I had to lean down and touch it to realize it wasn't actually faded and torn up. Fashion choice of carpeting not-withstanding, the building was still very clean and mostly in good repair. In the rooms, the windows, that used to open at one time, were clumsily bolted shut, meaning no fresh air. We also ran into a problem with the room HVAC system. It was at a very warm 72 degrees when we got there. We set it to 65 and 36 hours later when we left it had made it to 70 degrees. Since it was late and we were tired, we opted to sleep with other covers rather than spending an hour waiting for maintenance to tell us that it was working as expected :)The rate we paid for the room was around $145, which is reasonable for a Mag Mile hotel, but I admit that the hotel fell short of expectations. I had never been to a an Intercontinental property before and had a lot of respect for the brand. Now, I'm not sure that I would spend the extra to stay in another property because the one in Chicago fell short of expectations.To summarize: The room as very clean, the bed was comfortable, and the service was great, but the room was small, the heating/cooling didn't work properly, and some of the finishings and fittings in the room were rusty, tarnished, ill fitted, etc.",nan,nan,ta_s1566
trip_advisor,"The Hotel Intercontinental is a perfect location for exploring this vibrant city. Everything you could want is right outside the door. From world-class restaurants to historical buildings and the American Girl Doll Store, staying at the Intercontinental is wonderfully convenient. The rooms are very clean and the beds just heavenly...really nice after a long day of exploring Chicago! Our lovely concierge was spot on about the restaurants she recommended, we loved every place she suggested. A must see at the hotel is the beautiful architecture in the pool area. It's just gorgeous!!During our stay we unfortunately had our travel plans interrupted due to an incident at Midway Airport. We greatly appreciated the staff extending our stay in the room and giving us coupons for the on-site Starbucks. Actually, spending a few more days in Chicago wasn't all that bad.",nan,nan,ta_s1568
trip_advisor,"I just loved staying at this hotel. My room was so clean and nicely updated. The bed was very comfortable too. I was upgraded to a room with a view due to my status and it was incredible! My favorite part of this hotel is the junior olympic size lap pool from the 1920's. If you are a swimmer, bring your gear and be sure not to miss the opportunity. There is also a sauna which was very nice after swimming.",nan,nan,ta_s1569
trip_advisor,"Feb 16, 2015: Overall decent, however, we had a noisy HVAC heating unit, flat pillows, and smelly towels.Do suggest that hotel addresses HVAC issue, removing flat pillows and replacing with fluffy pillows, and PLEASE put some laundry booster when washing towels over and over again.For a luxury hotel, one would think that the giant pool area would have a Jacuzzi. But to our surprise, there wasn't. The pool area was beautiful and don't quite understand why you wouldn't have a hot tub for couples.",nan,nan,ta_s1570
trip_advisor,"Hotels is on Michigan Avenue, which is very centrally located. Close to shops, restaurants, underground. Check in was very crowded and there was a huge line ahead of us. Luckily my husband had a Gold card and had separate check in. Room was on the 21 floor. Nice but rather small and similar to all other IC hotel rooms. Beds were comfortable and clean. Bathroom was basic and could use a little paint. Rooms are well isolated. In my opinion this is more a business than leisure hotel. If I would get a good rate I would stay here again, otherwise I would go to another, more cozy hotel.",nan,nan,ta_s1571
trip_advisor,"Biz trip, only stayed few days. So available time for shopping is precious. Centralized location (Michigan Street), gives us plenty of time for evening shopping. From KIDS: Disney for kids wear, High end fashion lovers: Burberry flapship store - Must go in & experience ""Art of the Trench"", Macys, Bloomingdales, Victoria Secrets for friends & family gifts shopping. Convenient for food too. Level 1 - right side; starbucks (your breakfast choice!) and left side; Micheal Jordan Steakhouse (open daily, served both lunch, dinner - try MJ's Delmonico 16 oz! Crab cake and pork chop are good as well. And it even has night bar..). How convenient can it get! However for the slightly pricey room rate, since i didnt use much amenities, if i am for holiday, DoubleTree By Hilton (few blocks away) can be a good alternative.",nan,nan,ta_s1572
trip_advisor,"I stayed here because I got an excellent rate and as a Platinum Ambassador, I was able to check in early and was upgraded to a newly renovated suite. Bed was comfortable, hotel is quiet, and facilities are excellent. Location is about as good as it gets. For me, it is more or less next door to where I had business meetings, so that was a key decision making factor.The valet dropoff was easy enough, but pickup is less obvious because one has to go down to the garage, but it didn't detract from the overall experience. This will be my hotel of choice in Chicago from now on.",nan,nan,ta_s1573
trip_advisor,"In lieu of presents for our grandchildren on Christmas and birthdays, we take them for an overnight somewhere. We took two of our older grandkids, Jake and Maddie, 17 and 12 respectively, to Chicago over Martin Luther King Jr. holiday. One of the requirements of a hotel is a swimming pool. The Intercontinental Hotel's pool was a highlight but not as significant as the kids' first impression of hotel's lobby area. They were blown away. They especially like the giant video screen behind the reception desk. Starbucks was a hit as well. Our suite was the extreme whipped cream on the sundae! They absolutely loved it. We arrived on Sunday and checked out on Monday. We dropped our bags off and went out for the afternoon. When we came back, the kids swam. The decision was made to have dinner in our suite via room service. When reviewing the time we spent, Maddie reported the time we spent eating and hanging out in the room was her favorite.We were allowed a late check out which made it possible to do activities on Sunday, collect our things, check out and make the train.We would recommend the Intercontinental and plan to stay their again on another grandkid overnight.",nan,nan,ta_s1574
trip_advisor,This stay started terribly but the staff made up for it. We stayed here for one night the weekend after Christmas. We arrived a little after check-in time of 4 PM. We were told there are no rooms available and that we would not be able to check in until around 6 PM. They were pretty much telling everyone that. We were in town to shop so no big deal. We checked our bags and went shopping. They said they would text me when the room was available. We were out shopping and about 6:30 PM I decide to call and check in since we have 8:30 reservations for dinner. They tell me the room is still not available but they will 'put a rush on it' We got back to the hotel around 7 PM and checked to see if we could check in. They did have our room available even though no one thought to notify us. We got our room keys and went up to the room. Keys did not work. Went back and spoke to someone else said they wrote the wrong room number down. They did give us a drink and breakfast coupons which was nice. The room itself was nice and adequately sized for Chicago. There was a shower and a tub which was nice. We had a nice side view of Michigan Avenue from the 7th floor. After we returned to the hotel from dinner we stopped to get a drink in MJ's bar downstairs. It was nice with a decent crowd. The breakfast buffet was really good the next morning.The staff that we dealt with in person while checking in were very polite and apologetic. I am not sure that I would choose to stay here again given all the choices in Chicago. The location is great on Michigan Ave.,nan,nan,ta_s1575
trip_advisor,"I stayed there with my mother and gran. We stayed for 3 nights and there was a wonderful women there who helped us with everything we needed, she was funny and not as serious as i would've thought the staff here were. There was a Starbucks connecting to the hotel, and again the staff here were friendly and willing to help. The decor was beautiful and everything was clean. It was a good location and although the hotel was lovely, the prices of the stuff in the fridge however, were not. There was a walgreens and a 711 on every street corner practically! The water taxi was maybe 3 building away and you took this to pier 49. The tour bus was also just right outside. I would highly recommend this hotel if you were looking in this price range, worth every penny!",nan,nan,ta_s1576
trip_advisor,"This lovely hotel has a exquisite swimming pool and meeting rooms that make you feel like royalty. Even the fold out beds are comfortable.But best of all, the staff is great.I was waiting for a package that did not arrive. I spoke with Sylvia Rollins about it and she very kindly and patiently asked about all the details. Then, she connected the dots and found a package that had been mailed to their hotel with the name of my company, but not my name or my room number. She was wonderful and I wanted to thank her in public.This note also can serve as a reminder -- if anyone is having a package sent to a hotel, be sure to have your name AS WELL AS your company name on the package.Thanks again to the Intercontinental for a wonderful stay.",nan,nan,ta_s1577
trip_advisor,I spent 4 nights at the InterContinental recently and was definitely pleased with the property and the staff. The location was very convenient and allowed me to walk everywhere except to/from the airport (the train station is just a few blocks away). I stayed on the 26th floor but did have some road noise to contend with. I did find that he IHG website did not offer me the best rate on this particular stay however given that I have had problems with 3rd party sites in the past I will simply shop around and then call the property direct to make my reservation. Would definitely recommend this property if you are in the area.,nan,nan,ta_s1578
trip_advisor,"I reserved a king ""superior"" room as part of an event block more than a month prior to the event. Upon arrival (20 minutes after check-in time started) I was advised that the room size I selected was ""more of a preference than a reservation"" and that the room type I selected was sold out.I acknowledge that this is probably a common thing if a hotel gets full for them to downgrade groups with discounted rates, but when I went online I saw plenty of king rooms and suites still available at this hotel! I called to ask for one of those rooms ""even if I had to pay for it"" and was not met with a conciliatory voice in any way, shape, or form. I was surprised that this class of hotel would make so little of an effort to help solve a problem that clearly had a solution. I called customer service for the hotel and was told that someone from my hotel would call me back but they never did. I don't think I can stay at this hotel chain again, how could I ever trust that my reservations would be respected? If you are organizing a group please keep this review in mind!",nan,nan,ta_s1579
trip_advisor,"We booked our stay in Chicago last minute and got a great deal for the international. We arrived into the city late in the evening and were welcomed by the beautifully lit magnificent mile with all its Christmas decor Check in was mad - so many people and so loud! Turned out it's pretty much like that all the time - the Starbucks in the lobby too (we used the one across the street, no lines) Our check in was fast and impersonal - no info given etc just here's your keys have a good stay (it's line management as opposed to guest experience)Our room was on the 35th floor with huge windows overlooking three sides of the city - it was fantastic! The room was large, tastefully decorated, a huge Devine bed, a beautiful bathroom! All in all it was very impressive! The location is also great. Subway station a few blocks away. Shops/bars/restaurants right outside the door. The open top bus stops one block away. It was perfect.The concierge recommended two great pizza places and gave us his card so we wouldn't have to line up at east side Gino's - this was a big plus as the line was long, it was cold and we were hungry! (Great restaurant!!!)Our only grievance - we stayed three nights - on our second night we were heading to bed at about 1am when suddenly the corridor filled with a large party heading into the adjoining room. Then the loud music, shouting etc started. Our room had a joint door to this room (presidential suite) and party goers spent the next hour trying to open the door or standing on the other side of the door chatting, laughing etc! There was a constant stream of people coming and going and each time the main door to the suite would bang! After over an hour we called the reception to request they be asked to keep the noise down and to also resist trying to get into our room (if you did happen to start nodding off you were jolted from your sleep suddenly by the fright of someone pulling the door down!!) The girl on the phone was polite and said she would send the manager up. Twenty minutes later and still no manger the party getting louder and louder we called down again to be told the manager had been up - to which we advised this was not the case5minutes later the manager and two staff arrived. Such was the noise level we could hear the whole conversation from our room. The occupants of the room apologized and agreed to scale the party down in 30minutes!! Now in fairness they did - but I was a little taken aback that the manager agreed to his suggestion he'd only carry on partying for 30 more minutes when she knew it was effecting other guests Anyway all in all it was a good stay and I would go back We didn't use the bar/restaurant or pool area Near By great spots:House of Blues The Turtle club (tortoise??)East side Gino's",nan,nan,ta_s1580

trip_advisor,"We just stayed at this hotel for the weekend. We enjoyed our stay. The hotel is very nice, clean, and wonderful location. Great pool area ( but the shallow part of the pool is 4ft deep) We easily walked to several popular tourist destinations. Very quiet in the room.I will say that $67/night for parking is INSANE!! Use an online parking spot finder to find nearby parking for way cheaper.The room had all the amenities that we wanted ( in room safe, large flat screen tv and mini-fridge) but I will say that we were disappointed in a few things in the room itself. 1) The mini fridge is just that-MINI! We could not take anything out of the fridge to store the snacks/drinks that we brought because there is a sign that says "" anything removed from the fridge for more than 30 seconds will be considered purchased."" We have never seen this before so we were wondering what kind of amazing technology feature this fridge had. Needless to say, we didn't want to get charged for anything, so we ended up filling the bathroom sink with ice to keep items cold. #2- this room is SMALL! There were 2 full beds ( would have been nice if they at least had queens- it is very hard for 2 adults to sleep in this full size bed) a desk, and a chair to sit in and it was cramped! #3 We added on a package to our stay and were not informed of the benefits of the package at check in. Luckily I had done my own research and knew what the package included. The in room movie ( which was part of the package) was charged to our room and we had to go to the front desk to get it taken off. No apology given for the inconvenience. #4 there is ONE ice machine on the 7th floor. We were on the 20th. Enough said...Breakfast buffet was decent- coffee, juice included- good selection of fruits, pastries, bacon/sausage, etc.Bellman held our luggage at check out so we could be tourists for the afternoon. They were very friendly.All in all, a nice overnight stay. I don't think we were overly impressed with anything, but not overly disappointed either.",nan,nan,ta_s1582
trip_advisor,"Couldn't ask for a better location, close to all shopping, sightseeing and restaurants, parking. Read about the history of the hotel, very interesting. The swimming pool is beautiful and restored like it was back when it was created with beautiful tile work and stained glass windows. Set up like a lap pool, which can be a little difficult for youngsters who just want to splash around. Won't see another like it. Very friendly front desk staff. Rooms are small, but comfortable beds and updated decor and clean. Coffee shop right next to lobby which was great in the morning before a walk on the Mag mile.",nan,nan,ta_s1583
trip_advisor,"We live in the suburbs of Chicago and came down wanting to stay the night in a hotel with a pool. The Intercontinental was great! Water was warm, about 4 other families with kids of all ages. Lots of fun! We brought a ball and played catch.

Food was fantastic but as with everything in the city - pricey. We will be back!!!",nan,nan,ta_s1584
trip_advisor,"Asked for an upgrade after purchasing on priceline, we were given a room that had two windows facing a brick wall, and was so saturated with cigarette smoke in the bathroom that we literally could not breathe after showering. Ruined an attempt at a romantic in-town getaway. Informing the staff upon checkout resulted in a non-committal grunt and a gimme-yer-money-and-get-lost attitude, from this shabby property with terrible customer service coasting on location and architectural history. Will never be back.",nan,nan,ta_s1585
trip_advisor,Came to check in on Saturday in the morning with an extremely polite and professional female front desk agent with a unique name. Night Manager from the Previous night booked us into a Jr. Suite. My buddies loved the room as they could watch one football game and me and another could watch another game. Pool was great. Get there early or it will be overrun with kids (Understandable). Breakfast was on point. So many options. Will def stay again. Also Free WSJ in which i was a huge fan of at Breakfast. Great Location.,nan,nan,ta_s1586
trip_advisor,"We were up around the 30th floor of the historic tower, with three windows looking over the city and a sliver of the lake. Beautiful! There's a Starbucks attached to the lobby. Parking is outrageous though! Managed by an outside company. You can save $20+/night by walking a block or so and parking elsewhere. We left the kids with family so this stay was just my husband and I. The food at the attached restaurant was great too, and we had a lovely seat by the window watching life go by in Michigan Ave.",nan,nan,ta_s1587
trip_advisor,We arrived on time for our 3pm check-in. The room was not ready. It wasn't ready until 4:45.The only compensation we received was 4 complimentary drink tickets which we couldn't even use because the restaurant was full due to none of the rooms being ready.The wait to check the luggage at the bellstand was in excess of 20 mins and so was the wait to retrieve the car from valet.The staff are very rude and don't seem to care about their guests.The room was decent but you can find better in the area for a similar price.I will not stay here again,nan,nan,ta_s1588

trip_advisor,"I couldn't have asked for a better location. Smacked right in the middle of the Magnificent Mile on Michigan Ave across from Nordstrom (my fav store!!). And got such a great deal!!From check in to check out, everything was flawless. The staff was so nice & explained my charges and deposits to me when I didn't understand. The room itself was a little small. Smaller than any of the rooms I've stayed in while in Chicago (I've stayed at 2 other hotels in this same location, these rooms were particularly smaller in comparison to the other two) but the room was comfortable and had a nice view! The bed was comfortable. It did get a little tight when there were two of us in the room unless one of us was laying in bed while the other walked around. Really a tight squeeze but for a single person, I think it would be perfect. Housekeeping did a good job, I was there for 4 nights. The first two days I was there, housekeeping came after noon (while I was gone), the last 2 days, they were at my door by 8:30am, really? Housekeeping at 830am? Since when? Anyway, I was still in bed both of those times (I'm from California so it was 630am for me!!) that's just way too early seeing how check out isn't even until noon. Location location location. Couldn't have asked for a better location & with such a steal on the rate. I can't complain. I would definitely stay here again should the chance arise!",nan,nan,ta_s1590
trip_advisor,"Single night stay was awesome.Thursday was our anniversary so we thought we would check priceline and try to get a downtown hotel just for the night. We blind bid priceline 4.5 star hotel for $75 and got the Intercontinental. This is a great price for a Michigan Ave hotel and probably shouldn't be expected normally.We were expecting a bad room because most hotels have some bad rooms set aside for priceline/hotwire bidders. However, we were greeted warmly by Rey at the front desk and we told him that we came downtown for a night for our anniversary. He half-smiled (which may have been legit...but my cynical mind thought that he was thinking we were trying to scam him). Anyway, we asked if it was possible to get a king bed and he said not only could he do that but he would upgrade us to a suite, free wi-fi, and 2 Starbucks gift cards (Starbucks is in the hotel lobby)! VERY NICE!The suite was on the 10th floor and in the ""new"" building. Apparently there is a newer building and an older building. I read a review on TripAdvisor that the older part has larger rooms....I can not verify that. Our suite was a good size.The king suite had a sitting room with a couch and a chair and tv. The other side had a bed, couch & TV. the bathroom was clean and spacious. Everything was nice. The only downside was the fridge. We went out to eat and had leftovers but the fridge is one of those that is packed with overpriced stuff and if you take anything out, you are hit with the outrageous fees. There is a tiny space for your personal stuff...maybe 6""x6"" space inside the fridge for personal items. Can't complain for the price but if we were to have paid a normal high price, it would have caused resentment.A note on the carpet design: It immediately looks very worn but after a while you realize that that is the design. It is an unflattering design just because it looks worn and old, but it isn't.We overslept the next day and asked for a late check out and they again were extremely accommodating. The staff is just outstanding.Good: The Staff, Clean, modern decor, wi-fi signal (strong), lobby opens on Michigan Ave, Valet parking, near everything.Cons: Parking cost $65 + valet tips, refrigerator space, windows (screen was torn).We would love to stay at this hotel again! Overall, it was a great experience and we wish we had the time to stay a few more nights. I would highly recommend this hotel.",nan,nan,ta_s1591
trip_advisor,"We arrived early, so of course our room wasn't ready, which was expected. Our room was on a higher floor and facing Michigan Avenue in the Historic Tower and it was totally quiet for our three night stay. We had a rather large room and it was clean. Our only problem was that when we left that nobody would answer the phones downstairs to have someone come pick-up our luggage. There wasn't any hotel guests at the Bellman Stand when we arrived and requested someone to retrieve our bags out of our room. Unfortunately that process took almost 15 minutes before our bags arrived in the lobby. Also, the hotel didn't seem too busy for December.",nan,nan,ta_s1592

Breakfast buffet really nice even though the space is not actually large. Fast check out. Everything was as expected. Congratulations to the hotel management.",nan,nan,ta_s1594
trip_advisor,"This was a weekend getaway for the family (myself, wife, and sons ages 9 & 11). First of all we chose this hotel because I have a lot of reward points and this stay was free for us. To be fair I'm not sure we would have chosen this hotel if we were paying...not for any particular reason, but InterContinental is generally not a brand we choose when traveling together. It's not quite as kid friendly as some others.We had a nice stay. From the beginning it started off great. We were greeted as we got out of the cab and helped inside. I'm a Platinum Elite member and was checked in by a friendly guy at the Ambassador desk. I was upgraded to a deluxe room and given a couple of free coffee coupons for Starbucks which is attached to the lobby. After in our rooms for a while we heard a knock at the door and were met by a staff member bringing a plate of fruit and a bottle of spring water and thanking us for being IHG members. Nice touch! Sometimes it's the little things that make a difference.The location is great. Only about a block north of the river on Michigan Ave. We've stayed further north and now prefer this location. There's a lot more to do especially if you're traveling with kids. It's walking distance to Millennium Park, Grant Park, Art Institute, and if you're ambitious you can walk to The Museum of Science and Industry and Shedd Aquarium.Plenty of restaurants in the area too. Michael Jordan's Steakhouse is in the hotel although we did not go there. Billy Goat Tavern is nearby which was good...really anything you would ever want is within walking distance.Overall a great hotel with a great staff. The only complaint I have is the indoor pool is for ""lap swimming only"" as the sign said. My boys were pretty disappointed. I'm sure we could have snuck in some swimming and nobody would have cared, but I didn't want to be THAT family. And we really didn't have much time to lounge around at the hotel anyway so no big deal. We would definitely stay again.",nan,nan,ta_s1596
trip_advisor,"The rooms in the new tower are more modern, but the historic tower has more space in the rooms and it is easier to access the pool from it. I love the pool, but it does not seem to have an obvious handicapped accessible entrance and involved a lot of steps to get to. That said, seldom does a hotel have a 10 foot deep Olympic length pool accessible from the twelfth floor. Breakfast was spendy but quite delicious. I suspect the main floor Starbucks gets a lot of business on account of the in house dining prices. Expect to pay 65 for parking. The beds are very comfortable, but alas, the stairs aren't a good option for quick access to the main floor or lobby as the new tower stairwell empties out into an emergency exit on the ground level or on the second floor into the kitchen. That was awkward as someone who prefers to skip the elevator wait. I wish that had been clearly marked. I would go back as the location is great and i love the full size pool and the classic charm of the older posts of the building, but i will remember to make sure that i am in the right party of the building for my taste next time.",nan,nan,ta_s1597
trip_advisor,"This is a good Intercontinental hotel in the heart of Chicago. Located on the Magnificient Mile, there is no shortage of good restaurants or things to see nearby.The hotel is on the older side, but feels more historic than old. The lobby is impressive, and definitely exudes luxury. The rooms, although recently renovated, feel a bit outdated. I stayed in a one bedroom suite in the historic tower. The size of the room was impressive, but the decor is a tad gloomy. The bed was very comfortable, and the sheets were of high quality. There is a good selection of beverages in the minibar.The staff at this hotel is top notch. Service is clearly important here.Treatment for Ambassador and Royal Ambassadors members is good, but not great. They do have a dedicated check-in area. When I got to my room there was no in-room gift or fruit as promised. Also the card left in my room was for a completely different member. Sloppy mistakes in my opinion, especially for a Royal Ambassador member.",nan,nan,ta_s1598
trip_advisor,"I really enjoyed the intercontinental and the front desk staff was superb.I asked for a little extra floor space in my price range and they kindly accommodated. And because of a family emergency I had to check out early and again, they kindly did so.The fitness area has free weights as well as machines, which I appreciate. And although I didn't use the pool area, it has to be seen - it has a tiered table area overlooking the very large pool area - a remnant of another era, but lovely to see.One negative - $65 for overnight parking...outrageous. I parked at McCormack of $20 and cab'd back!I like the atmosphere of this place and hope our company uses them again in the future.",nan,nan,ta_s1599
trip_advisor,"My husband and I were in town for a conference and booked a last minute stay at the InterContinental through Priceline after our original lodging proved less than stellar. The front desk staff was very helpful in getting us checked in early and making sure we had everything we needed; all things that went above and beyond what is expected. The room itself was beautiful and well kept. The one thing that could be a negative is the rooms are a little smaller, but as we were staying in the older side of the hotel, not unexpected, and not a problem for us. Every staff member we encountered was helpful and went out of their way to make our stay nice. Will definitely be staying here again.",nan,nan,ta_s1600
trip_advisor,"I travel a lot and can't get excited by hotels - quite, clean, efficient is usually enough. Occasionally one does really impress. I am so glad I tried this one out. The location is great and it's a really nice building too. The team found me a great room on the top floor away from the lift (my tip for any hotel check you're not by the elevators) and have looked after me well. Added bonus that there are three cafe/restaurants in the lobby - Starbucks, Michael Jordan bar/cafe and a winebar. I often judge a hotel by whether I would bring my wife back here for a visit and I would definitely do that with this one.",nan,nan,ta_s1601
trip_advisor,"We are a couple with my wife attending the 100th RSNA conference in Chicago.When we travel we typically use the hotels associated with the IHG Group - essentially the Holiday Inn, Crowne Plaza and Intercontinental.My wife is a Platinum Priority Club member - and also prior to departing Australia I also re-joined her in the Ambassador Club. The latter is for when staying at Intercontinental only hotels - where you can get an extended check out, some freebies on arrival etc - and also a complimentary one night stay voucher.This is not our first time to Chicago but was our first time at the Intercontinental. The hotel was completely booked due to the thousands of people attending the conference during the week.Our room was not available upon my early arrival about 10.30 - and so they kindly put me into another room so that I could at least update my emails etc. Shortly after 12 noon they phoned to advise the room was available. When I saw it - I thought WOW. Level 38, corner suite - glorious city and lake views, big separate lounge, big king bedroom, big bathroom - we only booked a normal king room and so this upgrade was an amazing surprise. When my wife saw the room after her first day at the conference she was suitable impressed as well. Thank you Intercontinental. You will continue to have our loyalty.From my perspective the hotel is very well situated for what I did during the day - shop! It takes about ten minutes to walk to a choice of two Macys stores - one south and one north. Great for post thanksgiving shopping sales.This would be our preferred hotel of choice when visiting Chicago again.",nan,nan,ta_s1602
trip_advisor,"This hotel is famous...Famous for its location on the Magnificent Mile, Michigan Avenue, close to great stores and shops, not far away from the loop and some museums.The historical part is a strange mix of Middle Age period, waiting for Lancelot and Robin Hood, and the new building used to be another hotel. Rooms can be either great or disappointing, at random, for the returning guest. This time, we got a room in the modern part. Nothing much to complain about but nothing to rejoice for. Average... The heating system was so noisy that ear plugs where needed.Breakfast is nice, staff smiling and food on the right side. Michael Jordan's restaurant is a traditional meat restaurant, high price with average value.So, good address but do not expect too much !",nan,nan,ta_s1603
trip_advisor,Perfect location for walking to everything!! Tiny rooms but well appointed and very clean! Kudos to housekeeping -- probably one of the cleanest hotel rooms and bathrooms I have stayed in! Ask for a room with a view as there are many beautiful views from this location! Appreciated the early check in very much! Friendly helpful doormen! TV service was down hotel wide during our stay and front desk staff wasn't very helpful in making accommodations for that.,nan,nan,ta_s1604
trip_advisor,"The best location to be in the Chicago downtown. Plenty of shopping opportunities, corner bakery, bus stops, train station, river all a few steps from the hotel. Starbucks is located right in the hotel lobby but it closes at 8:00 PM.Room was really nice with high end fixtures, good TV channels, very clean and very nice view of Michigan Avenue. We were on Floor 5 but there was no noise from the road below whatsoever. Complimentary amenities: toiletries, coffee maker with supplied in the room, bath robes.Important notes: Parking at the hotel is $65 a day and there is no free wifi in the room. Best time to be in Chicago for first timers in Summer weather wise. We like to be there in winters when there are no lines and you can enjoy the dinning and the shopping.",nan,nan,ta_s1605
trip_advisor,"We spent a few days in Chicago for Thanksgiving and selected the Intercontinental because of its swimming pool. We got very interesting rates and actually the room (new tower) was better than expected. Great views on the beautiful Michigan Ave buildings, two comfortable beds and all you may need in a modern structure. But you are in an historic Hotel right in the middle of the Magnificent Mile. Few weak points: the room size: even if the room is bigger than many other downtown hotels, don't expect so much space. The WiFi fee: a Hotel should provide free connection at least in a few common areas Lastly the cost of the parking ( $65 for 8-24 hours ). On the other side, you can easily walk in one of the many WiFi friendly places and park at the River East Center Self Park and you will save some money. Last, the pool is a gem considering that you're in downtown. We can enjoy swimming in separated lanes, admire the intricate architecture and spend some time in the sauna ( inside the locker rooms ).",nan,nan,ta_s1606
trip_advisor,"We just visited Chicago last weekend for the Magnificent Mile Christmas parade celebration and stayed at the I.C. Nice room, very quiet, staff and concierge were very attentive, helpful and personable, especially since they'd had a major flood which was impacting check in for lots of guests for this event and a Bears game! The only negatives were no onsite breakfast. Loved the MJ steakhouse bar, appetizers were unusual and delicious-don't miss the garlic bread! Hotel was in a great spot for sightseeing and public transportation.",nan,nan,ta_s1607
trip_advisor,"Decent priced hotel at the center of downtown. Right on Michigan Ave and great access to anywhere downtown. They recognize IHG Plat, and was provided a choice of free bottle water or 600 IHG pts. Wireless internet is free, but very slow. Was also give a Starbucks voucher for a free coffee. Room is a bit dated and lighting is insufficient. Nice exercise room and indoor pool, with a good dry sauna.",nan,nan,ta_s1608
trip_advisor,"We stayed here for Lights festival parade.. On the ""right side of the street"" and near Pioneer park. AMAZING location for this affair, parade view Michicagn Ave. room, 967 though our window was nailed shut we could'nt hear . The room service excellent, no reservations at Michael Jordan's that night open, no sweat they will deliver a great steak right to your room kids menue is great yummy ice cream vanilla. Dont order desert not that delish the 23 layer cake and vanilla creme brulle for us were so so. Also the kids Mac & cheese has parmesan cheese crust on top not traditional my 6 yr old hated it. But the cheesburgers,, Amazing. all for $10. The pool was 20'style, era of long ago in the historic section, crown molding s, 4 tier sitting area sconces and water feature. The pool is DEEP, don't be fooled bring those floaties for the kids. Jr olympic sized as well.... draw back no bathroom on the premises,,, have to go down 2 flights of stairs across the pretty reception area with wet feet to get into the lockers area. The hotel had a water pipe freeze and two elevators were in working order only which made for a great adventure going down the stairs from the 9th floor with our luggage and cutting through the kitchen at Jordan's restaurant with our kids and a million waitstaff buzzing about during lunch rush hour! Apparently the 2nd floor is the end of the stair escape or you end up in the banquet hall. The rooms are small but cozy and comfy the carpet a bit dated in the new section of the hotel.. Loved the personal touch of texting our early check-in request when our room was ready and the beautiful Christmas tree in the lobby under the sweeping staircase. Also the valet service pull up drop keys and go was excellent right by front doors. Overall a good experince minus the elevator situation. Make sure you enroll with IHG hotel group or no Wi Fi service in the rooms. We will try the Conrad I think next year but will definetly keep this hotel as an option. Thank you",nan,nan,ta_s1609
trip_advisor,"Stayed here for a night on the end of a business trip, the location is great, about a 2 minute walk from the river and right beside great shopping, restaurants and sightseeing. On arrival, there was a mix up with my booking as my travel agent had double booked a room in my name which the person on the desk seemed to think was my fault. The decor of the hotel was nice in the common areas, lovely lobby, bar and restaurant. The leisure centre was also very nice, especially the pool which was beautifully maintained, however once again let down by the staff members - very abrubt, rude and unwelcoming. I also think its a cheek to charge residents for use of the leisure centre ($13)! The standard bedrooms themselves are well appointed albeit in a strange layout. They are long and narrow which does not give a lot of walking space between the bed and the opposite wall/desk. Bathroom was OK (however the bath is tiny) and the toilet was not fully cleaned. I stayed on the 15th floor and I could hear people talking at street level, so the sound of traffic as you can imagine did not make for a quiet night - definite need for sound proofing on the windows.The carpets on the corridors are badly in need of replacement. My experience of the staff was somewhat redeemed on checkout - I had been wrongly charged for a minibar item whih the nice girl checking me out apologised for and was most polite. Also the bellstand staff who looked after my luggage were very friendly. Overall, I'm not sure I would recommend this hotel if you are looking for somewhere with a friendly warm atmosphere.",nan,nan,ta_s1610
trip_advisor,"Apart from the superb location and the gorgeous exterior this hotel can certainly NOT be compared to the other InterContinental Hotels I've stayed at before (Hong Kong, Boston, Singapore,...).The check in desk looks and seems like a cheap exhibition hall with a huge LED display behind the counter. Check-in was very fast and impersonal. We weren't even pointed towards the elevators or told what floor we were on.Our room was tiny but the worst is yet to come...The drains in the bathroom started smelling like sewer in the middle of the night. My sister and I were both woken up by the smell and couldn't fall back asleep as it was too much to take. We left the room at 6:30am to wonder the streets as we just couldn't stay in the room any longer. It was disgusting!!!When we left in the morning we mentioned the smell to the Concierge who said she would send someone up. No apology, nothing.We asked for the manager at check-out and he offered us a free breakfast (at 11:30am!). When we told him we already had our breakfast he said: ""well, your room was already paid for so I can't do anything about that. Why don't you ask for me again before you leave and I get you lunch"". Yeah right, as if we would be begging for lunch in a hotel that made us sleep inside a sewer. No thank you. We're in Chicago about every 6 weeks and luckily there's many wonderful hotels on Michigan Ave that actually appreciate their customers. We won't be returning.",nan,nan,ta_s1611
trip_advisor,"This is a very centrally located hotel, designed for convenience and with well equipped rooms. However, wifi connection is expensive per day and to eat in the hotel is expensive and average, while the bar facilities are standard. The hotel is designed for business conferences and business travellers rather than tourists so it feels a bit sterile but overall the positives outweigh the negatives.",nan,nan,ta_s1612
trip_advisor,"I made a late decision to fly to Chicago and join my daughter (who attends Wheaton College) for her birthday earlier this month. And with shows and conventions on going, I tried to find a room at other hotels I already experienced, like the Hilton Suites and the Marriott, but to no avail. I was surprised to have been able to find a room at the InterContinental Chicago. And ultimately had such a pleasant check-in experience after flying some 18 hours. After I checked, I remembered being an Rewards Club member. And upon informing Rey Andujar (the same gentleman who checked me in) about my membership, not only did he ensure my membership number was logged in but I then witnessed a quality of service and the attention from him that ultimately convinced me to subscribe to the Ambassador Club. I have not regretted doing so and the experience has convinced me that the InterContinental should be at the top of my list when booking hotels in any part of the world.",nan,nan,ta_s1613
trip_advisor,"Excellent hotel great location. The staff are always helpful and polite. The rooms were great, the beds were so comfy and the room was toasty even though it was -10 outside. The gym and swimming pool was great the staff were really helpful. And it opened early:). The food in the restaurant in the lobby (Michael Jordan's) was excellent but was far too much for my daughter and I to finish. The concierge service were also very helpful. And finally the doorman was always helpful, cheerful and polite even though he was outside in that awful cold",nan,nan,ta_s1614
trip_advisor,"I disclose that I have elite status with this chain. In contrast to my recent stay in Paris, this hotel is huge, impersonal and hindered by its size. The staff were varied. I watched staff doing all the right things, exuding the culture I expect in such a property. But as others mentioned- the service is SLOW and the phone is answered after minutes and an intolerable phone tree.The room was well appointed but lights were far to reach and multiple switches. The bed was comfortable and the room large with an excellent view. The TV was undersized for such a room and viewing distance. The gym was small for such a large property and for others it was extra ( group and ambassadors, free). The pool is spectacular.I may or may not stay again at this property but my expectations will be much lower.",nan,nan,ta_s1615
trip_advisor,We stayed here 2 days ago and I have to say the stay was almost perfect the only issue that we had is a maintenance issue and it's kind of weird but the windows in the room won't shut and seal properly and with it being so cold and windy there was a lot of cold air coming into the room other than that I couldn't ask for a better stay the room was quite large all the furniture was in good shape the bed was comfortable good size bathroom the staff was extremely friendly and accommodating even sending up some cheese and crackers and a bottle of wine which was definitely a nice surprise on top of the upgrade that I got on top of all of that the hotel is very centrally located no matter which direction you want to go on Michigan Ave I would definitely recommend this hotel,nan,nan,ta_s1616
trip_advisor,"I stayed at the hotel for 3 nights, and was upgraded to a 2 bedroom apartment on the 40th floor. Great views. It was in the older side of the hotel, but still nice.The only thing i found a little wrong about this hotel was that when you rang instant service it wasnt very instant. You were generally on hold for a while until someone would assist to your enquiry and i had to ring up 3 times throughout the day to have the minibar restocked. Even asking to have the minibar stocked up, they wanted to know what had to be refilled, isnt this the job of the staff to sort out, not mine!The gym was great, plenty of weights and runners to do your thing, and the pool area is all heated, so you can swim all year around.Good hotel, and concierge are helpful too.Maybe another operator or two on the instant service could speed things up?!",nan,nan,ta_s1617
trip_advisor,"My wife and I checked in on a leisurely Sunday. We were given no directions to the room at all and, after trial and error, discovered (on the 3rd attempt) that the three different elevator banks take you to different parts of the property. Another guest who had had the same problem theorized that the front desk prefers it when guests have a porter carry their luggage.The room was very nice with views of Lake Michigan in the distance. The mini-bar had a notice that guests would be charged for any beverages removed for more than 30 seconds so I just kept my breakfast (a 2 liter jug of Diet Coke) on the table and trekked to the ice machine the next morning. But the policy seemed a bit draconian to me.You walk out of the hotel lobby and are on the Magnificent Mile. As a longtime fan of Chicago, that wins bonus points. But I thought the Intercontinental a bit snobby for my taste and not a good value price-wise.",nan,nan,ta_s1618
trip_advisor,This hotel is a wonderful Art Deco building in the best location. The staff were all efficient and friendly. The concierge was really helpful. My room was on the 8th floor looking over the front : great views. The room was a little small but comfortable. Very clean. Looked a little in need to tlc. The wardrobe door slats were broken. No light in the wardrobe so you couldn't see clothes. Bathroom was small but fine. Breakfast offered a good selection : it's a buffet. The room could be made to look a little nicer but the food was good.  Best thing about the hotel is the building and location and staff.,nan,nan,ta_s1619

The Corner bakery is across the street which is a great place for breakfast, Grand Luxe and Lawry's are only a few blocks away. The staff were courteous and friendly. Parking cost $65 at the hotel but it was easy breezy. Be sure to read up on the history of the hotel, it's very interesting. And also check out the pool!",nan,nan,ta_s1620
trip_advisor,"Stayed one night at the Hotel Intercontinental with the family for a downtown birthday celebration. We had one room on the 37th floor of the Historic Tower and one in the Main Tower. Views from the Historic tower were great. Location is great - right on Michigan Ave across from Nordstrom's. Rates are not cheap - $322 per night. Parking is absurdly expensive - $65 per day. The rooms are nice. The linens are soft. The bathroom is marble. The Continental restaurant has a nice buffet breakfast, but it is $28 for adults and $8 for kids. The indoor pool is very nice and is accessible from either tower on the 12th floor. The fitness center is nice, free weights, treadmills and machines. Locker room has a sauna. There is a Starbucks and Michael Jordan's Steakhouse on the ground floor. If you can get a reasonable rate, this is a great downtown hotel.",nan,nan,ta_s1621

trip_advisor,"This hotel was perfect for my husband and myself...You are literally less than a mile away from the Navy Pier (back of hotel), Millennium Park (left of hotel), John Hancock Bldg (right of hotel), and straight ahead is shopping shopping shopping and lots of places to eat. Very similar to 5th Avenue in NYC but less busy and very clean city. We LOVED Chicago! My husband and I are IHG Gold members and are fans of the Intercontinental brand. It was what we expected. The service was exceptional from check in to check out. We arrived at the hotel at 8:00 a.m. and concierge did find us a room and we were able to go and sleep for a few hours until we were ready to get up and go out into the city. Since we are gold members we were given a access code for the gym and the wifi (no fee otherwise there is a fee). The pool is complimentary for all guests. Room 3704 (37th floor only 5 rooms on floor) - We were in the ""old"" tower. The room was a decent size with a large bathroom. King bed with feather down comforter and pillows (really comfortable). The room had 40 inch flat screen with tilt view. A safe and in room coffee maker (under TV in console). There was a desk/chair, a lounge chair in the room as well. The bathroom had a tub in the far corner and a stand up shower in the other corner. Small sink area although large mirror and area to lay your toiletries out. The towels weren't great I actually was kind of disappointed on the towels (texture not soft and fluffy or really large). The water pressure wasn't great the hotter you wanted the water. Other than that the restroom was great like I said it was really spacious. The tub set up was great. We never heard anyone else on the floor or on the elevators with us. We had a great view of the lake and the city side. We were told by a maid the ""old"" tower was going to be renovated in the spring. We were just curious because of reviews we had read. Our room was perfectly fine but updating a property never hurts!We used the gym it has state of the art cardio equipment but not so great weight equipment. It was fine but it would've been nicer if it matched the cardio equipment. Cardio on first level, weights and pool on second level (floor for gym/pool is FC).We did not eat at the Michael Jordan Steak house because we have one near us and wanted to try things we could only get in Chicago. I reviewed many of the places. There is Starbucks attached to the hotel lobby. There are Starbucks EVERYWHERE (I'm a Starbucks girl so I was really happy about that). In Starbucks there is a coffee carafe that says Intercontinental on it with cups near the sugar/milk station. I'm assuming it was Starbucks coffee complimentary for guests. I drink ice so I paid for mine. I thought that was nice. In lobby they also have computers set up so you can print your boarding passes another nice touch. We will be back and more likely than not stay here again! I would recommend this hotel.",nan,nan,ta_s1624
trip_advisor,"I stayed at this hotel for 3 nights for a business meeting. While this hotel has beautiful architecture, the rooms were ordinary. If I were to visit the Chicago again I would stay elsewhere. Positives: clean room, plenty of power hook ups in room, great lemon verbena soaps Negatives: room not ready until after checkin, bags took 30 mins to arrive at the room, the concierge did not answer the phone the 2 times I calledThe worst part, when our bus arrived a staff member came running out of the hotel yelling at our driver because he parked partialy in front of a private garage space. There was no one needing out of the garage. He continued to yell at our driver, who did not have anywhere else to park, until all of our luggage was unloaded. Needless to say this unprofessional employee started our stays out on the wrong foot. Kudos to our driver for not engaging. Slow service at the restaurant did not meet expectations. Lastly, the bed was a rock.",nan,nan,ta_s1625
trip_advisor,"I must admit that the Hotel is located right where you want to be if you are looking to do some shopping. Blocks away from some of the Top brand name stores. Nordstroms right in front. The Lobby has access to a Starbucks and Michael Jordan's Grill. The breakfast is a little pricey at $28 USD per person at the Continental. Another downside about big city (Chicago, NYC, Etc) hotels is that they charge just about everything ! The Gym and pool has a fee. The Internet service has a fee! Etc. Etc. I would definitely stay again.",nan,nan,ta_s1626
trip_advisor,"I love to get away in my own city and this location can't be beat! Check-in, Valet-lower (Wacker) to make life easier, all easy and friendly. (Try ParkWhiz.) The ease of getting to the Lake for a night walk with the wicked waves of the Halloween Howler, walking up to Rush Street for dinner and cupcakes, people watching on Michigan Avenue and wandering along the river. The breakfast buffet and service was excellent but the concierge was the best! Rachel was able to get us into a restaurant that was booked and made suggestions that were appropriate for my 15 year old daughter and me... We secured tickets to the All-Blacks Game. (Who did they play?) Many concierges at other hotels seem stressed but Rachel took the time to deal with us in a friendly way, This location is the best. The rooms are okay, (although the bedding is great) but when we decide to stay in the city, and we get an awesome rate online, that is not our priority.",nan,nan,ta_s1627
trip_advisor,"Excited that I was finally going to stay at the Chicago Intercontinental storied hotel. Upon check in I was processed like a slab of beef and religated to the ""new"" tower. The ""new"" tower was a soviet era housing block glued onto the historical tower. The room - sub par. Threadbare towels, tiny space, a decor from the early 90s. The only good thing I can say about my experience is that I received a free cup of Starbucks. I travel to Chicago monthly and can say that this hotel has nothing on its Magnificent Mile counterparts.Avoid.",nan,nan,ta_s1628
trip_advisor,"I attended a conference at the Intercontinental and stayed in a 6th floor corner room. The room was clean, the bed was very comfortable and the conference room was gorgeous. I've got a thing about water pressure at hotels (because so often it is lacking) but the pressure here was great. The corner room offered nice views and plenty of light. Best of all was the location, which was central for the other meetings I had scheduled in Chicago. I did not eat at the Michael Jordan's Steakhouse on the first floor, but the bar was a nice cocktail venue after a long conference day. Also having a Starbucks in the lobby is always a plus. My only knocks would be (1) the room was very small, which wasn't a problem for me alone, but it would get cramped quickly with a family in tow, and (2) there are apparently sensors on the wine tray next to the TV that detect movement of product and automatically charge the room if anything is moved (I was erroneously charged for a bottle of wine, although they corrected my bill before checkout). I would stay again.",nan,nan,ta_s1629

The rooms on the new side are modern and sleek. All the rooms pleased their occupants! If you stay here you MUST go to the indoor pool! You will be amazed! Their is a Starbucks in the lobby and a fantastic, though a bit pricey, breakfast buffet!Shopping is literally right outside the front door as you are right on the Magnificent Mile!!",nan,nan,ta_s1631
trip_advisor,"Checked in early afternoon. We were checked in by a trainee, but she was very pleasant and helpful. She did not yet know the layout of the hotel, so it took 3 tries to finally find a room away from the elevator. The room was spacious, clean and quiet. The breakfast buffet in the morning was pricey, but super! Not included in the room rate but it was extensive and delicious. The location is convenient to public transportation in the city.",nan,nan,ta_s1632
trip_advisor,Staying here for a conference. The hotel layout is odd because the rooms are divided between two towers. The hallway is nondescript. The meeting space and banquet areas have sweeping stairwells. It could be a nice setting for a wedding or a gala but a little odd for the conference. The staff is nice and expedient. The pool is an unexpectedly nice touch. Not my style but better and more interesting than other hotel pools. Location is convenient to shopping on Michigan and to the loop.,nan,nan,ta_s1633
trip_advisor,"This hotel is a one in a million. The rooms are clean & comfortable. As with other downtown hotels the rooms are small. The staff was friendly and helpful. The Michael Jordan rest. PRICEY! The InterContinental is located in the middle of everything. (walking distance to play, park, shopping and dining). We found a $99 dollar rate, while that is not the average if you look you can find great deals. DO IT! It is so worth the trip. If you like to swim there is a really nice pool on the 12th floor.Remember if you like to have a cocktail, it is a better idea to bring it with you and have cocktail hour in your room before you leave the room.",nan,nan,ta_s1634
trip_advisor,"While this hotel is in a great location, is very clean and well appointed, in the new tower section it has the worst layout of rooms I have ever seen. I don't normally care tremendously whether my hotel room is large or not as I don't usually spend a great deal of time awake in the room. But these rooms are a danger to your shins, knees, hips etc. as arrangement is so convoluted. The space between beds and furniture and walls is very narrow and there is no way to easily walk around. If you need to get up in the night be sure to turn on all the lights as otherwise you are very likely to bang against a furniture corner. The entry into the bathroom is offset so that the counter has to have a notch cut out to allow the door to open and when it does open, it can only do so 90 degrees which means as you enter, you need to navigate yourself around the countertop as well. I asked to be moved to another room figuring I had just gotten an odd weird room. I was told all the double rooms in that tower had the same contorted layout. I ended up paying an upgrade to switch to a room in the older ""classic"" section which was a very nice room.",nan,nan,ta_s1635
trip_advisor,"I would call it a four star but we maybe did not get the best room as we did a priceline. They probably count on the priceline wins not to complain because of the better deal they get and give them the less desirable rooms... should'nt be that way. Not like they were sold out. Room had very loud HVAC system. Something was probably wrong it also ran constantly but we were too tired by the time we got to bed to deal with it, I did turn it off completely a few hours before we got up. The carpet in the hallways was unbelievably worn. Otherwise the room was OK.",nan,nan,ta_s1636
trip_advisor,"This hotel was perfectly located for our woman's weekend trip to Chicago. We could walk to Navy Pier and to any shops that we chose to go to. Loved being on The Magnificent Mile. The room was spacious and clean, we stayed in the renovated tower. The staff at the front desk could not be more helpful and pleasant. The concierge desk staff was outstanding! My only complaint would be that I wish they would have had free wifi.",nan,nan,ta_s1637
trip_advisor,"The hotel overall was very nice. My room was quite small and could use some updates. But the location cannot be topped. I was able to walk to all of the major stores that I wanted to visit in between meetings at the convention I was attending. The America Girl Store was about a 10 minute walk and the big mall (Nordstrom, etc.) was directly across the street. There is a Starbucks right in the lobby, which was a HUGE bonus for me. Michael Jordan's restaurant is also located inside and was FABULOUS!!!! Our meeting space was adequate and the ballroom was great! The group was around 260 people, which fit perfectly. The stage and screen for the presentation was nice and large. There is also a second tier in the ballroom if you had a larger group and needed the additional space. The second tier offered a great view to the stage.",nan,nan,ta_s1638
trip_advisor,"My sister picked this hotel, but I was impressed by the condition and quality of the Intercontinental. From the reception and room service to house keeping and concierge, everyone was friendly amidst a not-always pleasant Chicago crowd. The hotel boasts several restaurants, including Michael Jordan's steakhouse plus an on-site Starbucks which my sisters were thrilled about. You can easily catch the red line subway about 4 blocks west of the property. The blue line is about a 3/4 mile walk which was easy to get to and from. I actually took the blue line from O'hare to Clark/Lake then walked to the hotel. While I didn't eat at the hotel, my sisters enjoyed their room service and the Starbucks like I mentioned. There is a Walgreens about a block and a half away which has amazing fresh juices and smoothies. There is also a terrific restaurant across the street called The Purple Pig. Back to the hotel...the rooms are adequate in size, maybe a little small with 2 full-sized beds but they are very comfy beds with cozy sheets and soft pillows. I hate when pillows are hard and my chin is on my chest! The bathroom was a great size, the water pressure was great and the toiletries were stocked daily. I love that the room had a mini fridge for drinks or leftovers which we had a couple of times. There is a lot of trendy shopping nearby plus eateries and Navy Pier is only 4 blocks east. Even getting to our segway tour was a breeze and only a mile away. There is a lot of nightlife (lounges, bars, clubs) nearby, so either walking or taking a short cab ride is a breeze. I do recommend staying in this hotel if you like the Magnificent Mile area.",nan,nan,ta_s1640
trip_advisor,So this hotel is not up to the usual intercontinental standard but in fairness it's working within the architecture of an old building. So you trade the usual comfort for the great location. Staff are friendly and while they acknowledge your Ambassador status as a club member there are no bells and whistles. The welcome letter said a choice of welcome amenity or points we were just given points. We would have chosen the amenity if we has been given a choice and no room upgrade. Despite being platinum ambassador members with a guaranteed room upgrade we only got the room we paid for. Well not exactly we got two standard adjoining rooms one with a long instead of the bed. So it wasn't a suite and with only a narrow adjoining door you don't use the second room as it isolates you from your companion. I have spent more than 100 nights in intercontinental properties worldwide. This one is very basic. We would not return to it on future visits and if it weren't for the location I would have scored it 2. The rooms are very disappointing when you compare it to the usual intercontinental standard,nan,nan,ta_s1641
trip_advisor,"Stayed at the Vice presidential suit, very spacious, very nice value but the hotel is too old and needs a lot of renovation, staff are friendly in general, their GM was standing in the lobby and greeting guests which is a nice gesture.Concierge staff are nice but I believe they need younger guys who are aware of the nice restaurants and activities.Was disappointed to know that there is no club lounge in the hotel.Location is great, walking distance from everywhere.I would frankly consider it more of a crown plaza than an intercon.",nan,nan,ta_s1642
trip_advisor,"Stayed here this past Saturday night with my husband and family. The hotel is beautiful and you can't beat the location!! The staff was extremely accommodating and very knowledgeable. This was my second stay in the last couple of months and this has become my favorite hotel in Chicago. Don't even get me started on Eno, how can you miss with amazing wine, cheese and chocolate? I wish I had more time to visit!!!",nan,nan,ta_s1643
trip_advisor,"For whatever reason my first trip to Chicago ever was a mere two weeks ago, the occasion being a dear friend's wedding. I knew that the hotel had been chosen for a number of reasons, which the hotel delivered upon perfectly. The location was superb. The events of the wedding would all take place in one or another portion of the hotel. And finally, the hotel offered enough space for everyone to enjoy being close without being cramped. During my stay a number of events were happening at nearby Millennium Park, and the mix of tourists and interesting locals up and down Michigan Ave. made the atmosphere inviting and safe. The hotel itself is obviously a vintage piece of grand architecture, which allows for some leeway in terms of ultra-modern conveniences and fast emerging trends. Yet my room straddled a corner, offering multiple windows, and ample space for the king size bed, furniture, and great hallway toward the luxurious bath.My room was on a high floor, which would have allowed for the neighboring office tower to have a great view into my room- had it not been the weekend and everyone was at home. Perhaps this is normal for big city urban life; I just wonder if the windows are tinted on the outside for some degree of privacy. If not - se la vie. The hotel's views of Chicago's downtown skyline are AMAZING!As for the amenities, I was delighted that there was an ample sampling of shower gel, soaps and shampoos, all with a delightful fragrance. I took advantage of the complimentary shoe-shine service, which was a life saver. I didn't have to sit through it, simply sent the shoes and they came back sparkling. The lobby of the hotel features the world-class Michael Jordan restaurant which delivers on what it promises. A great vibe, good strong drinks at the bar and a hearty meal. Cheap, it is not.The only blip in the experience was the unfortunate ""business center.""A hotel of this size could surely spare a few actual usable computer terminals with seating and some privacy - much like a lower end property offers. This particular set up offered two or three computer monitors with pre-selected 'buttons' for the various airlines for which to print boarding passes. Unfortunately all three terminals froze up at the same time, leaving all my personal information (name, travel data, etc.) exposed on all the screens. One of the managers attempted to reboot the system but was unsuccessful. While this system was probably sold to the management as a great time-saving tool for busy travelers; most business travelers today are well aware how to navigate to what they need, and don't need a dumbed down system such as this. In short the hotel is a jewel in Chicago's crown with excellent service, clean and stylish fitment. The ballroom and other public areas were completely amazing with natural lights, huge windows and elegant chandeliers. This hotel is a great ambassador for a great city!",nan,nan,ta_s1644
trip_advisor,"I stayed at the Intercontinental Hotel as part of a conference. My room was in the new tower and the conference sessions were in the Historic Tower. The Hotel is right in the middle of the Miracle Mile shopping area and convenient to many shops and restaurants.The Historic Tower, which was built in the 1920's has incredible architecture. There are very nice spaces, half-floors, fountains and beautiful sculptures and tapestries. All breakfasts and lunches were catered as part of the conference and the food was excellent. My room was clean, quiet and very comfortable. Everything in the room worked well. I do have one minor complaint. There was not much in the room as far as the list of amenities so I didn't know there was a safe in the room until I was checking around to make sure I didn't leave anything behind just before checking out.",nan,nan,ta_s1645
trip_advisor,"We couldn't have picked a better spot to vacation in Chicago. We were in walking distance to great shopping, restaurants and attractions.Also, we had a health emergency and could walk to North Western Hospital.Our room was quite large with fantastic soft sheets.The pool was huge, but could have been warmer.Michael Jordan's restaurant located in the lobby was delightful too.We would definitely book this hotel again.",nan,nan,ta_s1646
trip_advisor,"I stayed here for two nights in order to go to a concert at Soldier field. The location from Soldier field was great, it was about a 40 minute walk but easily found. There are many great stores and food chains all on the same street as the hotel. The staff were very friendly and willing to take and/or hold your bags even after you were checked out of the hotel room for the weekend. Over all the hotel was clean, friendly, beautiful, and in a great central location. I highly recommend staying here.",nan,nan,ta_s1647
trip_advisor,"Everything about our trip was made better by staying at the InterContinental. When we arrived our car was met by a friendly and efficient individual who answered our questions and quickly unloaded our luggage. Our bellman, vince was outstanding. He quickly brought our luggage up and welcomed us to the hotel. He answered all our questions and gave many valuable suggestions as to where to eat anfd visit. When we returned to our hotel that evening he had brought up a bottle of wine and two glasses in honor of our 50th anniversary. By the endo fo our stay we felt like we had a new friend.I would highly recommend the hotel as its location is perfect and all of the people with whom we interacted were friendly and efficient.",nan,nan,ta_s1648
trip_advisor,"I just returned from a weekend with my sister in Chicago, staying at the InterContinental for the first time. Check-in was friendly and efficient and while my sister was going through that process I was asking concierge Bob a number of questions. He was beyond friendly and made me feel like an old friend. Upon arriving at our room we found we were short several towels and within 10 minutes of calling housekeeping we had more towels. I also called room service since we arrived late in the evening, and again, in well less than the 30 minutes we were told it would be, our food arrived and it was delicious. Everyone we encountered at the hotel was friendly, responsive and helpful. The room itself was a bit small, but we were not there much and the space in the bathroom made up for it. Upon arriving home today I realized I'd left behind a pair of glasses and called the hotel. The gentleman I spoke to (whose name I did not get) said he'd go check the room himself and call me right back. Within 15 minutes I was notified my glasses were found and would be sent back UPS. I consider their customer service and response time excellent and would stay at this property again in a heartbeat....and in fact hope to!",nan,nan,ta_s1649
trip_advisor,"This is the third visit with my granddaughter to Chicago and there is nowhere we would rather stay than at the Intercontinental. Jessica Olden of Guest Services sees to it that our stay is memorable. To the upgrade to a gorgeous corner room, amenities too numerous to mention and the treat of the hotel's magnificent breakfast buffet, we were treated superbly and kindly. Doorman Clive was ALWAYS available to hail a cab or give directions. Thank you Jessica for everything. I hope your employer knows what a gem he has in you. My granddaughter is still smiling!",nan,nan,ta_s1650
trip_advisor,"I was there for three nights. At one point I decided to go back to my room to take a nap and pressed the ""do not disturb"" button on the door. I was first woken up by the phone ringing. I didn't answer it. Then there was subsequent knocking on the door and someone loudly yelling ""housekeeping."" As I had clearly marked my room ""do not disturb,"" I did not see the need to get up. The knocking finally stopped and the phone started ringing again. I picked up and was greeted by the housekeeper asking if I needed any services.""If a guess makes it clear that they do not wish to be disturbed, that option should be respected.",nan,nan,ta_s1651
trip_advisor,"If you are looking for a luxurious new hotel with large rooms this may not be the place for you. It is an older hotel that has been updated the best it can for the age of the hotel. For the price you can find a nicer more luxurious room, but you can't beat the location. This hotel is within walking distance of most all shopping, theater or dining experiences you could want. Just north of the river on Michigan Avenue. The staff was friendly and went out of there way to accommodate us. We requested an early check in and we were given that without a problem. Bus stops outside of this location will take you to museums, parks and further reaching destinations for only a couple bucks.",nan,nan,ta_s1652
trip_advisor,"Customer service was beyond excellent even as soon as we checked in with Malcolm at the front desk. Concierge provided great insight about the city as well as restaurants. Appreciate Michelle Slaw recommending her favorite Italian restaurant and even making the reservation for us! Great location on Magnificent Mile. So close to everything. Rooms were small though and needs to be updated soon, would stay here again!",nan,nan,ta_s1653
trip_advisor,"We stayed at this property for two nights with our family (2 adults, 2 small children). Our room was not ready at 2 pm, but was promised for 3. We left our bags with the bellman and valet parked our car ($$$$$$!!!!!). We were told that they would call us as soon as our room was ready, but we never received a call! Luckily, by the time we returned it was ready.This property is in a great location on Michigan Ave- a few blocks from Navy Pier and the river. Not much of a view from our room. The room was clean and comfortable, if a bit small. The hotel was very busy- looked to be 2 or 3 weddings going on the day we arrived.",nan,nan,ta_s1654
trip_advisor,"Location is great right on Michigan Avenue with all the stores and great restaurants. Close to River North cultural section and its a short walk to the lake front. Staff is very service oriented and friendly, quick to handle requests and good with directions or advice if needed from the Concierge. CLEAN is #1 in my book and this hotel is great keeping the house in order and fresh. Nice to have all the activities and conventions going on and they're right in the middle of it for me. You must stay here. If you're looking for assistance in multiple bookings, events or coordination help, Dana Solomon is the Director of Business Travel and she will get it done. Huge resource to tap into.",nan,nan,ta_s1655
trip_advisor,"The motel was awesome- clean the beds are amazingly comfortable. I can't say enough though about the concierge Bob that works there.Every question we had for him he had an answer for, he recommended a restaurant for breakfast then gave us his card which allowed us to skip the wait and be seated right away. He informed us of all the ways to best venture around the city and made our vacation such an enjoyable one. The entire staff were accommodating and the best part is the location of this hotel right in the Centre of all the action on magnificent mile. Would stay again in a heartbeat.",nan,nan,ta_s1656
trip_advisor,"The location in River North on Michigan Ave was excellent. Easy access to taxis. Many fine restaurants and bars in the area, plus great shopping and a Walgreens across the street. Classic hotel with semi-updated feel. We were celebrating our engagement and wedding venue shopping. We have pet allergies and the hotel upgraded us to a hypo-allergenic room. The room was fine though the shower leaked all over the floor and the bathroom needs updating.Despite putting both ""Do Not Disturbs"" on the door (light and the sign), housekeeping walked-in on us while indisposed. Management said it would never happen again. Housekeeping did it again the next day. Even though we were having a romantic getaway, a huge family in multiple rooms were put next to us. Their children we slamming doors and running in hall at 3am. We called security but it continued for over an hour.We reported all problems with our stay to the management and they offered to compensate us saying, ""We're a better hotel then this and give us a chance to prove it."" Two weeks passed and no compensation. Told it should have come, it's coming soon, be patient as they'd follow up and get back to me the next day. They never follow up so I do. Told two more weeks and nothing. Another call to management and two more weeks til they finally say it's been sent. Two months of chasing the hotel down to make good on their offer to compensate me for a very poor stay before receiving anything. Staff is friendly and offers good service though I wish the execution matched the intention. We'll see if things are better on our next stay.",nan,nan,ta_s1657
trip_advisor,"We came back after a great experiance last winter where I reviewed it with 5 stars. This stay was dismal. The staff was exceptionally rude and the rooms were really dirty! It's a 3 star try to advertise as a 5 star...including its price. We stayed one night and paid $250, no including taxes and fees, and they wanted me to pay them an extra $15 to use the internet for 5 minutes! Seriously? Watch out for extras added onto your bill. Wont be returning.",nan,nan,ta_s1658
trip_advisor,"Had a very nice, quiet corner room for our stay this past weekend. Fantastic water pressure in the bathrooms, but the shower faucet was strange. Very hard to turn on, it clicked to move instead of just turning it, it took me like 5 minutes to figure it out because I kept thinking I was going to accidentally break it. We paid for the hotel on Priceline and when we checked in they took a credit card for incidentals. Totally fine, except they put a $125 hold on the card. So weird, I've never seen a hotel do that before. Maybe because it was Lollapalooza weekend and people tend to trash rooms? In any case, great location for the festival - about a 10-15 minute to the park. And great location for shopping and restaurants. Very nice stay overall.",nan,nan,ta_s1659
trip_advisor,"This hotel is located in walking distance of many attractions and close enough to the train and bus routes to get you everywhere! Rooms are well-appointed and service is great. If you go, ask them to tell you how to see the pool on the historic side of the building. It is magnificent and just an elevator ride away.",nan,nan,ta_s1660
trip_advisor,"We spent four days at the InterContinental on the Magnificent Mile. We had a large king size room on floor 19 overlooking N. Michigan Ave. The staff, especially the concierge desk, were so helpful.It is close to the Red Line, which goes right to Wrigley Field and a short walk to many river cruises or Navy Pier. There are several restaurants close by that work for families: West Egg, Howell & Hood, Heaven on Seven, Grand Lux, and a short walk to Pizzeria Uno (or Pizzeria Due). Our sons are teens and picky eaters, so these places worked well because of the large menus.I would highly recommend this hotel. Be sure to check out the unique pool area even if you don't want to swim. It was built in the 1920s and is so elegant.",nan,nan,ta_s1661
trip_advisor,"This is the second time we have stayed at this property, both for special events when the city was full of people, and they got it completely right. Rooms are comfortable and clean. The beds are great and the location of the property is beautiful. Elijah at the front desk served us again this year. What a great first impression of the property. He is so professional and helpful. Clive on the front door helped us on our last day and made a wonderful last impression.",nan,nan,ta_s1662
trip_advisor,"This property is in the middle of paradise. The Magnificent Mile is like being in NYC only it is cleaner and probably safer (even the few street people looked presentable!). This is really a nice hotel. The rooms are a little on the smallish side. We were there for a wedding so we got to see multiple rooms. The Michael Jordon restaurant is good for a cocktail or a bite to eat. The front desk was not to cooperative/approachable over a legitimate room problem (AC not working properly, dirty windows). However we worked it out. Kathy the head concierge was great, most helpful and pleasant. A little better on the management side would make this a 5 star experience.",nan,nan,ta_s1663
trip_advisor,"I recently stayed 5 nights at The InterContinental Chicago on Michigan Avenue. The location is top notch. I walked absolutely everywhere from this hotel. I had a room in the newer tower which was very modern, clean and comfortable. I would not hesitate to recommend this hotel as your base for seeing the great city of Chicago.",nan,nan,ta_s1664
trip_advisor,"Former Chicago residents, we had stayed at this hotel before. This time we arrived as a family - two small girls in tow. The gorgeous architecture that is nearing a century still remained as pristine as it has always been. But traveling with children gave us a new prespective.At check in, the concierge brought tiaras to our girls. We were upgraded to a king suite, for free. The room was the size of a substantial apartment, with two full baths (separate tub and shower, all marble). Our request too have the sofa bed turned down (we checked in shortly before 9 pm) was so quickly completed that the maid was nearly done when we got to the room. The room and bedding were luxurious. The hotel has removed what used to be the restaurant and exchanged it for a Starbucks, putting great coffee on-site. There is a steakhouse and bar on location. The pool is, well, elegant and beautiful, a reminder of a decadent and by-gone era. From the valet to the front desk to the room cleaning services, the well-trained and happy to accomodate staff exemplified perfection in service.",nan,nan,ta_s1665
trip_advisor,"Stayed here with our friends and kids and had a lovely time. Location can't be beat as it's the only hotel right on the Mag Mile, which made it easy to pop in during the day. Our room had a great view and they have metal cribs for young kids. Do the self guided tour if you have some time ... you get a good behind the scenes look at the history of the property. There's additional costs for a fridge in the room, access to the gym and wifi but taking a dip in the pool is free! Sign up for the membership program and you'll get free WiFi! We had a double stroller and it went everywhere easily and had plenty of space in the room as well. Ask for the historic wing if you want more space, new wing is modern but smaller rooms. I hear there's upgrades being made to the historic wing soon.",nan,nan,ta_s1666
trip_advisor,"Booked the Intercontinental through an Expedia package deal for a long 4th of July Weekend with wife and 7 year old son. As everyone says, the location is in the center of everything and there isn't a more conveniently located hotel in the entire city. This is a VERY large hotel and the lobby was always extremely busy. I agree with the other poster who said there were few places to sit and relax. I tend to like hotels with homey lobbies and a nice cocktail lounge within but this is much more akin to a convention hotel. It was an absolute zoo all weekend, and if there is a lobby bar, other than the one in the adjacent Michael Jordan's Steak House, I didn't notice it. Still, we had a pleasant experience. We arrived very early (11:30AM) and fully expected to just drop off our bags with the bellman and do touristy things before checking in later in the afternoon but were pleasantly surprised when we were told rooms were available and could check in right then. I booked a double, not realizing that in hotel parlance, double means two full size beds, and apparently not two queen size beds so that was mildly disappointing. I won't make that same mistake again, but other than that, the room was fine so I didn't want to press the issue. The Bedding was very comfortable and the Bathroom had a luxurious marble vanity with substantial counter space and a wall size mirror. Compared to the vanity, the shower / tub was a bit of a letdown but perfectly functional. The bath products were definitely good enough to snag a few for the dopp kit as I'm a sucker for good hotel toiletries. The pool on the 14th floor was beautiful and a unique blast from the past. Our interactions with the hotel staff were limited to check in and we never utilized the concierge simply because we have several local friends and were pretty booked with them all weekend. I can't fault the hotel for charging for wireless as most big city hotels do, but I've never heard of a charge to use the fitness center, which they do charge for it here. That was a bit of a surprise. All in all though, we had a good experience and would stay there again under similar circumstances Is it a 4 star property? Not in my opinion, but I never expected it to be and thought it was still a pretty good value.",nan,nan,ta_s1667
trip_advisor,"As an InterContinental member, my experience might be a bit different but the location is still great :)Staff are very friendly and helpful and the rooms are very nice. I enjoyed my stay very much.If you're not a member, do take into account that the Gym (with a semi-Olympic pool) has an additional charge as well as Internet access (based on your room and package).The Gym is well equipped allowing a full workout and the pool is simply amazing.",nan,nan,ta_s1668
trip_advisor,"We love Chicago. We flew Porter to Midway Airport, closer to the city. Cab fare is not too bad between $20-$30. You can take buses or subway for less. We wanted to stay on the Magnificent Mile and that location is just great, close to the river and a view of the river from our room. The hotel is quite nice and busy with a digital wall view of the street behind the front desk. We had a drink in Michael Jordans on the first floor but did not eat there. The room was great and the bed very comfortable. The service is always good even though a little impersonal but it is a large hotel. We enjoyed our stay thoroughly.",nan,nan,ta_s1669

When we got in the first night the little one wasn't going to sleep so polo(the head security guy) took us on a short little history tour and was so knowledgable about the hotels history! I was so impressed! The fed ex guys were also great too!! But the recommendation that we got was for a breakfast place from them was terrible! It wasn't their fault! We based it on the review from yelp that they looked up for us! That place was soo rude lol So I just wanna say thank your for all the help everyone I named in this! You guys were amazing! It's close to old town too which is a must see!!!",nan,nan,ta_s1670

Stayed in the new tower with newly decorated rooms, very nice. Was much quieter than I expected being right on Michigan Ave. on the 21st floor wasn't bothered with street noise. Staff was always friendly. You have to go see the pool room! It's beautiful in the grand tower.",nan,nan,ta_s1671
trip_advisor,"Had a family reunion of sorts in Chicago and most of us stayed here. All the staff we encountered were friendly and helpful, especially Mirsaola at the front desk. The location of the hotel is perfect if you are looking to be in the heart of downtown Chicago, specifically in the shopping district. The hotel itself was clean and upscale, however, I am sure you could find higher end options if you're looking for over the top luxury. The rooms were updated and I would rate them average for a hotel of this quality. Very comfortable and a nice place to stay. We too had a ""deal"", as it seems many have found via Priceline or Hotwire, so I think we got a lot of value for what we paid. We would stay there again.",nan,nan,ta_s1672
trip_advisor,"The InterContinental is a very nice hotel and provides a cool mix of old style luxury (large, beautifully tiled pool, a 'historic tower') while still providing clean, up-to-date rooms with modern amenities. The staff are quite friendly, generally speaking, and do their best to offer personal attention. That said, the hotel itself is enormous - so you certainly won't have 'that personal' touch of a smaller boutique hotel and check-in/check-out lines can be quite long.The gym is great (two floors, cardio/weights) and the pool is incredible (full lap pool, luxurious decorated), but the $12 usage fee is a bit insulting. On that note, keep in mind that like most high-end, large hotels in the neighborhood, fees for additional amenities are outrageous (be prepared to pay $5 for a Coke in the minibar, $20 for some eggs in room service).The location is great - right in the heart of the Magnifiscent Mile and an easy walk to downtown attractions - though a bit far from an 'L' stop.",nan,nan,ta_s1673
trip_advisor,"Hotel is in an excellent location for shopping and a very short distance from the Navy Pier and beach front. I stayed in the historic tower. The room was large and has everything you need to get a good nights rest. However, it is dark and lacks the wow factory that I've grown to love in boutique hotels. For business travelers the rooms lacks a wired connection to the internet, so you will have to rely on the hotels wireless options. The pool and weight room are nice. The hotel does a good job with room service. I wish the restaurant downstairs provided breakfast. Lastly the front lobby wreaks of cheap mens' aftershave.",nan,nan,ta_s1674
trip_advisor,"I booked through Priceline, so I called ahead to request a room in the historic tower. The reservations dept was very friendly and helpful and made note of my request. Upon arriving, I was given a choice between three rooms and chose a 25th floor historic tower room. The view was excellent, looking south toward the Tribune Tower, Wrigley Building and the Chicago River. The room was small but cozy and the bathroom was nice. We could hear some of the traffic and sirens from the street but it never kept us up at night. The beds were very comfortable. Being an IHG club member (free to join), we got free wifi and two coupons for free Starbucks drinks in the lobby. GREAT location right on Michigan Ave and walkable to just about everything. Very friendly and courteous staff. The hotel is older and shows age in carpet and some decor, but we were overall very pleased and would be happy to return.",nan,nan,ta_s1675
trip_advisor,"Stayed here for a work function I would definitely stay again if I'm ever in Chicago again. The staff was so friendly and very accommodating. The rooms were spacious with comfy beds and pillows, rainfall shower head was a nice surprise. I stayed on the 19th floor and had an amazing view of the Wrigley building. ENO wine bar off the lobby was great fun we each ordered a wine flight and a chocolate tasting and prices were very reasonable. Did not try Michael Jordan's steakhouse but several of my coworkers did and raved about the food. Great location shopping, food and bars steps away.",nan,nan,ta_s1676
trip_advisor,"The location is the only better than expected attribute. The hotel insists on nickel and diming it's customers. It's a rude surprise when a hotel still charges for internet. It's even sadder; when they charge for use of the gym. The GYM!! Oh but it's a huge gym with great equipment, no, it's a few ellipticals and treadmills. If these amenities are not of interest, then it's recommendable lodging.",nan,nan,ta_s1677
trip_advisor,"My recent stay at the Intercontinental Chicago was comfortable and highly convenient. However, it was pleasantly punctuated at the very end by Will, The Doorman's, smiling and helpful service. As I was rushing off to catch a cab to the convention, I realized I had no cash to spare, but instead of responding angrily, Will simply smiled and asked me to enjoy my day. There are not many people left in this world that can turn an embarrassing situation into warm and friendly service. This is what hospitality is all about!",nan,nan,ta_s1678
trip_advisor,"I recently stayed at the Intercontinental Chicago for a week on a business trip (with a fun weekend afterwards). The hotel basically has multiple-personality disorder, and the staff needs a lot of work.The hotel has two towers - the historic tower, and the new tower. The historic tower has larger rooms with older furnishings and obviously need a refresh. The newer tower was given a superficial face lift (lots of wallpaper, rugs, etc) - often referred to in the industry as ""soft goods"" and it's obvious that they did it as fast as they could - the work is pretty sloppy.The cleaning staff needs some major training. I had colleagues whose rooms were never cleaned during their stay. My room got serviced daily, however the cleaning wasn't very good. I dropped a fingernail on the rug, and kept tabs on it during the week. Something tells me the next guest got to look at it too.When I arrived in my room, I found the shower light flickering. I ended up calling the hotel to ask them to change the bulb, because the cleaning staff obviously never bothered to mention it to anyone. Also, it's worth noting - it's not like the bulb started flickering that day - the fixture had two bulbs, one was completely out, and the other flickered for 2 days before I decided to call to have it changed myself.My room was adjoining on two sides, which is something I've never seen before, and the doors aren't well sealed, so I'd recommend NOT getting an adjoining room if they're available. I heard one group ordering room service at 11pm, and the other having sex at 9pm.Finally, check-out on Sunday was a NIGHTMARE. My friend who was traveling with me was waiting on line for 10 minutes without it moving (about 20+ people long), so I told her there was a phone extension you could call and just check out that way, which she promptly did.This hotel all-in-all isn't bad, but I think they could use a management overhaul, and need some serious training through the ranks.",nan,nan,ta_s1679
trip_advisor,"This is a very, very, very old hotel. I'm sure there have been plenty of renovations done, but my lasting impression is that this is a very, very, very old hotel. There was a weird elevator situation, where certain elevators only went to certain floors. I think that helped with the wait time, but was confusing at first. The room itself was clean - small, but clean. Join their free rewards club - it gives you free wifi and a later checkout, which was nice. Also, they advertise their fitness center, but don't tell you that it will cost you $12/day. Be prepared for that. Great location. Very, very, very old hotel.",nan,nan,ta_s1680
trip_advisor,"Visitors to Chicago are spoiled with great hotel options and although the InterContinental isn't the Peninsula or the Four Seasons, it's a great option if you want to stay on Michigan Avenue at a somewhat lower price point. The recent room renovation successfully produced a great 4-star plus product and the addition of Michael Jordan's Steakhouse added a great upscale dining alternative for hotel guests. The staff is very accommodative, and I have found that InterContinental Ambassadors are well taken care of at this property. A great choice on Michigan Avenue.",nan,nan,ta_s1681
trip_advisor,I checked into the hotel for my honeymoon on May 9th and stayed over the weekend. I wanted to stay at a nice place so I could enjoy my honeymoon. There was a wedding party DIRECTLY beneath me (I was in room 905) all night and my floors were BOUNCING I couldn't sleep at all. I wasn't even going to complain because that just isn't in my nature but now when I checked out they assured me I had no extra charges but now I am seeing a $125 charge pending on my credit card (two days after the clerk assured me I had no charges on checkout). It was a nice room and great location but I could have paid 1/10 the price somewhere else. I chose this hotel because I MISTAKENLY assumed they would be able to provide a quiet atmosphere. Save your money and go to Holiday Inn or Motel 7. At least they won't tack on ridiculous charges. I'll most likely be spending the rest of the day trying to figure out what they are charging me for.,nan,nan,ta_s1682
trip_advisor,"In a competitive market it's not awful, just not good enough. I don't know whether wifi was included or not and the landing page didn't detail pricing. The view from my room - and I am a Rewards Club member - was literally of the metal-clad air shaft. The shower tap was broken such that only scalding water was available - which must have been obvious to housekeeping who presumably (hopefully!) need to turn on the water to clean the bath. On mentioning this at check-out, no apology, just a comment that they would get maintenance to look at it. I hope so, but that helps me how? The bar is a Michael Jordan's and while the service was good, I have literally not seen a menu with so much beef on it: even the salads have beef strips. I know that is the point and great if you love steak, but it's surprising to have so few options in a large hotel. The room itself was comfortable so big picture no complaints, but compared to my last Intercontinental (Paris) this felt like the last year of a Sheraton property Starwood is sweating till it's reborn as a W. Ironically, colleagues were at the Sheraton - supposedly a ""lesser"" hotel - and the public areas I saw were great.",nan,nan,ta_s1684
trip_advisor,"Stayed 4/29/14-4/30/14. I booked this hotel as a girls night away to celebrate my birthday(turned 20). I requested a room on a high floor and with a view. Upon arrival, the friendly and very nice valet came over to the car. I wish I could remember his name. He helped us with our bags and assured us our vehicle would be taken care of. We went in at about 10:30am to see if the room was by chance ready, and it was. We got the keys and off we were to the room. My room was on the 24th floor and had a view. I was delighted that my request was actually followed through. No free wifi here. ): We scoped out the room and took plenty of pictures. Fell in love with the bathroom and how spacious the room was. We were so happy that the beds were nice and soft unlike most hotel beds that are stiff and just about break your back. As someone with back issues I couldn't have been happier. We then unpacked a bit got our purses and went to see the historic lap pool. This is one of the reasons I chose this hotel. We took the hallway there, signed in and up we went to the pool. Its more beautiful than it is in the pictures! It was so relaxing in there. We snapped a few photos and then left to go shopping. We returned at about 5 and had brought back pizza with us. Upon entering our room we tried to put the pizza away. The mini fridge is quite mini lol. We took the items from the fridge to fit in the pizza just to find they wouldn't fit. We put everything back in the fully stocked mini bar we had in our fridge that had been taken out. While getting ready to go off for a swim I was reading the info brochure and found out anything removed from the fridge for more than 30 seconds is electronically charged to your room. We finished getting ready and went down to the front desk. I explained what happened to the manager and she removed the charges and reset the fridge. I asked her what we could do with our pizza. Right away she was on the phone searching for a fridge for us. She then told us if none were available we could store the pizza in room services refrigerator. We headed to the pool. You have to sign in again and rinse before swimming. We went into the locker/shower area and oh my was it wonderful in there! So spacious and clean! The shampoo/conditioner/body wash/lotion its all right there. There was even a machine to wash your swimsuit while you showered, how cool is that! There is a large locker room and sauna. Sauna is free and lovely. You then walk through the fitness center which has a fee to use and up the stairs to the pool. We chose our chairs and in we went. The water was just right and they have heaters on in the pool area so it was very nice in there. The room and atmosphere was so calming. Only thing missing is a hot tub. From there we went back to the room to wind down. Watched tv and enjoyed the view. It was a very quiet night and comfortable beds. No trouble sleeping. In the morning we got up and started to get ready. The shower heads have a rain effect which was wonderful. We packed our bags and headed to check out. We then had our bags checked as we were not yet leaving. The staff put our pizza in the room service fridge and our bags in the vault. We were given our tickets to claim them and went out for the day. We returned about 3 to pick up the bags and our car. The staff was friendly fast and so kind! All of our bags were brought to us as well as the pizzas. We then went to get the car and it was ready for us to go. I will be returning to this hotel I absolutely loved it. I want to thank the staff for helping me to enjoy my birthday and maki ng our stay a remarkable one! Thank you thank you thank you!! :)",nan,nan,ta_s1685

Jose also helped with transportation local points of interest. The hotel was clean with good amenities. The wifi was fast and reliable.

trip_advisor,"My extended family and I just enjoyed a long weekend at the InterContinental for a family wedding. For the most part, we had an excellent experience. When we checked in, the front desk manager could not have been more helpful with our somewhat complicated reservations. He went above and beyond to accommodate our needs. Our rooms in the beautiful Historic Tower were very nice. One problem though.....they do not have dressers or other drawer storage. When we complained, the staff found a small dresser and brought it to the room. A minor issue is the mediocre lighting and lack of a make-up mirror. Other family members stayed in the other tower and said the rooms were much smaller. We did consistently have problems reached customer service. The wait to speak to a person were long. Once, I just gave up and went down to the front desk.Both the ballroom and the pool are outstandingly beautiful.Be sure to bring take a look, even if you aren't attending a special event or swimming.We had breakfasts at the Starbucks in the lobby (which was just like every other Starbucks) and in the hotel restaurant (which was good but expensive). We had drinks at Michael Jordan's Steakhouse (also in the lobby), which was busy but fine.",nan,nan,ta_s1688
trip_advisor,"We booked our room through Hotwire and got a great deal for two nights. This is perhaps my favorite hotel on the Magnificent Mile. It is in the perfect location if you like being able to easily shop both North Michigan Ave or the South State St shopping area, walk to Navy Pier, or Grant Park and Museums.Reminder: If you are a IHG (Intercontinental Hotel Group) Rewards Member, don't forget to give them your membership number even if you book the room through a discount seller. You won't get the points but you will get the member benefits such as Free Wi-Fi, a cup of coffee at the local Starbucks and late checkout.When we arrived we were warmly greeted and quickly checked-in at the front desk. We were given a large corner room on the 19th floor that overlooked Michigan Avenue. (Hint: always politely ask the front desk person for a really nice room and they will usually accomodate you if one is available so don't be affraid to ask.) The room was larger than most Chicago Hotel rooms, clean, nicely furnished, had windows that could be opened, and very comfortable beds and pillows. Overall, a very pleasant stay with great service at a great location. I'll definitely be back!",nan,nan,ta_s1689
trip_advisor,"This hotel is extremely well located - across the street (Michigan Ave) from a Nordstrom's that anchors a large shopping center. The staff was very helpful and our room was comfortable and very clean.One thing I really liked is the daybed/sofa that was built in under the window - much better arrangement than the normal two chairs. Electrical plugs were plentiful and the only thing I wish I could have had (but didn't ask for it) would have been a small refrigerator in the room. The prices in the hotel dining rooms were high, but not unexpected for a very nice hotel on the Million Dollar Mile.",nan,nan,ta_s1691
trip_advisor,"Stayed here for two nights while visiting Chicago. Check in was easy and we were pleasantly surprised by the gorgeous view in our ""standard"" corner room on the 24th floor. The room was quite large and the furnishings were nice. The bathroom was very spacious as well. The curtains were wonderful for blocking out the morning sun if you want to sleep in. The bed was very comfortable and inside our room we could not hear any noise which was very nice. I really enjoyed the complimentary newspaper outside our door the first morning. All of the concierges were so helpful and friendly as were the front desk staff and the doormen. Loved the ENO wine bar and all of the flights they offered. The location of this hotel cannot be beat! You can walk everywhere and taxis are always outside if needed. I was very happy there was a Starbucks attached to the hotel. We will definitely stay here again and hope to be back soon!",nan,nan,ta_s1692
trip_advisor,"In terms of location, you just can't get better than this. If you walk out the hotel, you're at the Magnificent Mille, absolutely walking distance from anything you need in Chicago.I'm a little disapointed on the concierge, though. I stayed at this hotel for a few days, while waiting to move into my new apartment nearby. I had just arrived at the city, and asked for suggestions on what I should see. They did provide some tips, but never mentioned that the hotel itself is a landmark. As I actually only booked it for location, I had no idea of the interesting things I could see at the hotel. Only found out after checking out. There should be a pamphlet or something upon check-in.Other than that,very comfortable beds, fair pricing, good strong hot water in the bathrooms. Never tried the breakfast at the hotel, but they do have a starbucks right at the lobby.",nan,nan,ta_s1693
trip_advisor,"Stayed here the night before a race and was pleasantly surprised with how comfortable the beds were! I was happy to fall asleep in a soft bed, with a variety of pillow densities to choose from. Such a relief! The bathroom was a little cramped in the doorway, but other than that, the toiletries they supplied worked well and the bathroom itself was very clean. The only thing that made me a little uneasy, was the shower handle to turn on the water: It was very difficult to move it, to the point I was concerned I was going to break it or I was just completely doing it wrong. It felt like there was a really tight gasket on it. Water pressure isn't very strong, but it's a nice waterfall type shower head. So awesome that they had an iHome iPod dock for the newest version of Apple technology. My iPod was dead and I had forgotten my charger...well fear not, they have a charger for it on the clock/radio system provided. How awesome! It worked great too!They have a mini-bar in the room, but it was a little over-priced in my opinion so I didn't take the bait on that. It's a computerized system so when you remove it, it automatically charges it to your room. It also offered snacks, such as Pringles, Mars Co. candy bars, fruit snacks, chocolate covered almonds, cashews, and crunchy snack mixes.Overnight parking was $65, which is added into the authorization fee at the beginning of your stay. Use a credit card, never a debit card because the deauthorization may take up to seven days for a debit card to return back. Overall, wonderful hotel! I would stay here again, it was nice to be in the middle of everything. Very close to restaurants and stores. Perfect! There is also a HUGE StarBucks downstairs, connected to the lobby as well as Michael Jordan's Steakhouse.",nan,nan,ta_s1694

trip_advisor,"Just spent 5 nights in this hotel in Chicago and really enjoyed my stay.First of all the location is just perfect!! Right on Magnificent Mile, it is central located and you can walk to most majors attractions the city has to offer.Service was good, continental breakfast was included and offered a big variety of food and fresh fruits.But the highlight here is the building itself. The historic tower, or ""south tower was built in 1929 and most of it remains unchanged today. Make sure you visit stunning pool, at its time one of the hights indoor pool in the world and the largest hotel pool in the city! Absolutely stunning!Have a look around the different ballrooms and king's Arthur court. (The elegant Grand Ballroom, a two-story, 100-foot (30 m) elliptical space, was decorated with ornaments in Egyptian, Assyrian, and Greek styles and was surrounded by a horseshoe-shaped mezzanine. In its center hung a 12,000-pound Baccarat crystal chandelier, the largest in North America )The hotel was renovated in 1990 but is honestly in great conditions and not aging much. Rooms are clean and well maintained and they were smart enough to keep as much as possible of the original building.",nan,nan,ta_s1696
trip_advisor,"This is a great hotel on the Mag Mile. The location near the Tribune Building is well placed and makes the hotel easy to find. It is also within walking distance of a plethora of restaurants. The lobby area was nice and welcoming. The check-in process was quite efficient as Margaret processed me very quickly and very pleasantly. There were apparently two towers. I was on the top floor (26) of the shorter tower and was able to get upgraded to a suite because of my IHG status. The room was terrific and the view was superb. It was clean, very spacious and the WiFi worked well the entire week I was there. My floor was very quiet as it was free of both street noise and neighbor noise. The bed was comfortable allowing me to get a good night's sleep each night I was there. The breakfast in the Continental room was excellent. The selection was great and the made-to-order omelet service was particularly wonderful. The Starbucks in the lobby was also a great feature. The check out was very quick and allowed me to get on my way. The room rate was fair and commensurate with the high-quality product they offer at this property. Overall, if you want a nice place on the Mag Mile, this is a great choice.",nan,nan,ta_s1697
trip_advisor,"I stayed here for 5 nights for a conference at McCormick Place. Overall, this is a very good hotel. The hotel is located on Magnificent Mile so there are a lot of very good restaurants within a 15 - 30 min walk even in snowy weather. I like the fact that it is a historic hotel; the swimming pool on the 12th floor (go for a swim, or at least look at it!) shows this. I would not mind staying here again. However, the lobby needs attention; I agree with one reviewer that the lobby looks a bit like a bar. I arrived here on a Saturday when there was a big game. It looked like there were people selling T-shirts on the lobby that my heart sank a little bit.Location: very good location on the Magnificent Mile. It's less than 10 min by cab from Union Station. There are several very good restaurants within a 15-30 min walk even with snowy sidewalks! Eataly, the Purple Pig are easy walks.Check in: check-in was quick. I arrived around noon and was given a room even if the check-in time is 3 pm. The staff is friendly, courteous and helpful.Room: I was on the 26th floor in the modern tower. The bed was comfortable and the bath amenities were ample with a few extras like make-up wipes. Slippers and bathrobe were provided. I am very sensitive to noises but I slept well as it was quiet. The in-room safe was also a nice amenity to have. I would have preferred a small fridge and no mini bar just to have more space in the fridge for my own. The hotel is in a nice enough location that one can go out and purchase drinks or food for late-night snacks. My rates came with free in-room wi-fi but this is NOT always the case.Service: I opted not to have my room cleaned or linens changed every day. When I did call for the service, it was done by the time I got back.Breakfast: My rates came with breakfast at The Continental on the 2nd floor. The buffet was amazing with a lot of good, fresh fruit and several dishes from the hot selection.I had a pleasant stay at this hotel and I am happy to recommend it to anyone.",nan,nan,ta_s1698

This hotel is an elegant throw back to the hay days of Chicago in the early 20th century. Lovely architecture. It is so well maintained, a jewel. The lobby bar is not to be missed. Potter is also great place to have a cocktail or glass of wine during a city walk or before heading out to dinner. Our room had 2 beds and 2 full baths, making it perfect for me and my traveling companion.",nan,nan,ta_s1701
trip_advisor,"PAST GLORIESThis hotel is a landmark. As far as Chicago is concerned, it has been there forever. The passport control officer at the airport during his checks asked where we were staying. He made the comment that the hotel was the centre of wheeler dealing and conferences within the city.We arrived at the hotel quite late at night and were greeted at the entrance by one of their valets / doorman by name. It appears these guys check who is arriving and at what time, now thats a greeting.The hotel is big. To get to reception you need to walk through the lower level shopping mall to the elevator (lifts) to the lobby. The lobby is a grand affair of marble and polished brass. Adjacent to the lobby is what can only be described as the Grand Hall; and it is grand. Columns, marble, floral displays and a high high painted ceiling. It is impressive now, customers must have been gobsmacked when the hotel was built over 100 years ago.After we were efficiently booked in, we made our way to our room on the 8th floor. Now we had been warned by a family member that the ""Loop"" train passes alongside the hotel and to check that the room wasn't that side of the building. They did not warn us about what we experienced. The room was large, and relatively modern, but dated version of art decor (black painted, not lacqued furniture). There were windows, there were blinds and curtains; there was just no view...just a brick wall ! A small, but adequate bathroom and no tea or coffee making facilities. We initially agreed that the room was ok as we were only staying 5 nights. We had a good night sleep, so the beds and linen were decent. We just could not stay in a room with no natural light. So we checked with reception for availability for a paid upgrade. So for our second and subsequent nights we slept in our upgraded room on the 23rd floor. We were lucky, we made our enquiry on a Thursday when most conferences and meetings were ending and rooms were becoming available. Again no view, but it did have natural light and access to Executive lounge (mentioned later). The room was again a nice size, with two bathrooms (handy for couples), but smaller than the one on the 8th floor. Again, for all nights we had a decent sleep.HOTEL CATERINGWe arrived late on our first night and tired from our Trans-Atlantic flight so we had our first experience of hotel food in Potters Bar. Potters Bar is named after the hotels founder Potter Palmer. It is a small bar off of the lobby. Wood panelled and dimly lit, the bar is used by conference delegates and business men finalising a deal. The bars menu consists of basic burger, fried chicken and pizza fayre, but all is well cooked, tasty and served fast. They also have a pretty fine liquor menu and I can personally recommend their India Pale Ale !Lockwood Restaurant - a brightly lit modern style restaurant off of the Grand Hall. Its decor is completely out of keeping with the rest of the ornate lobby area.We arrived at the restaurant for breakfast at 8.30am and had to wait nearly 30 minutes for a table for two. The reason for the wait is the restaurant size is totally inadequate for the size of the hotel and they allow guests to hold business meetings at tables whilst other guests wait. If this wait wasn't insult enough the buffet breakfast was the worst I have ever experienced in any hotel in any country. It had either been cooked poorly or had not been managed correctly whilst on the hot counter. After eating a few bites we both left the ""cooked"" food and resorted to bread ,jam and pastries.The place was hardly a relaxing environment, these business people not only hogged tables for their meeting, they did not talk at a reasonable level, all they did was shout.Executive Lounge - after our experience with the Lockwood Restaurant we were pleased that we had access to the lounge for breakfast, for the most part. They had a very good selection of cold meats,loads of boiled eggs, breakfast cereals, oatmeal / porridge, breads, fresh cooked pastries and fresh fruit. For most days the lounge was kept well stocked for breakfast, but it seems they started to experience interloppers. It appears some people from the non-exec floors had managed for find their way onto the lounge floor and had gone through the food like ""locusts"". When we arrived a member of staff were busily replenishing the stocks whilst another was checking every guest key card for their entitlement.Things were okay over the weekend, then on Monday the business people returned and hogged the tables in the lounge. Not only that, they stole chairs from other tables, leaving other guests to carry chairs from one end of the lounge to another to make up a ""working"" table to dine at.I have marked the service as average, but this does not reflect the high level of service in Potters Bar and the Executive Lounge. Sadly it was Lockwoods that dropped the overall score.SecurityThe hotel is situated within the ""Loop District"", the area encompassed by the elevated railway. A family member recommended this hotel, with the caveate that the loop area had a reputation for street crime (this was declared in a science conference info pack they had received). We did not experience any problems during our stay, but that can possibly attributed to the burly Bouncers / Security guards that appeared on the Mall entrance doors after dark.The lower floors have no security other than the security staff previouly mentioned and and can be accessed from street level. The exec floor lifts require a key card for them to work.Summary : The lobby and Grand Hall are impressive and worth a look whilst sightseeing the city. As for the rooms, they are well maintained, comfortable but dated. The staff (excluding the Lockwood) provided excellent service.The corridor on the 8th floor had black and white photographs of past celebrity guests (Frank Sinatra, Eartha Kitt etc). That kind of says it all. The hotel is a landmark living off of its past.We slept well, but would we stay again ? No, the place is too much hassle for a vacation.",nan,nan,ta_s1702

Special mention to Tatiyana the lady that checked us in, her warmth and genuine interest in us really shone through. Would come back to this hotel in a heartbeat.",nan,nan,ta_s1704
trip_advisor,"I've stayed in the Palmer House several times this year and it was ok. This time the room seemed incomplete- no refrigerator and no glasses or cups in the bathroom. Also, no coffee cups or packets. From the first we had problems with the sink draining. The water just sat there. I guess we weren't that surprised when the toilet stopped working. The desk didn't seem to be that surprised or concerned when we reported it. I've had better service a Holiday Inn. Not what we expected.",nan,nan,ta_s1705
trip_advisor,"Aside from a great location, the staff at this hotel has been trained to please their customers in every way. They are very friendly, eager to help and assist in any possible way. Congratulations to the Hotel Manager, great job!! The entire hotel is a grand dame, kept in very good condition. The food at the lobby restaurant was great, very creative, unusual ingredients. My birthday celebration was made more memorable by the hospitality of the staff.",nan,nan,ta_s1706
trip_advisor,"The Palmer House is right in the heart of Chicago, close to Millennium Park, the Bean, Architecture, the theatre, symphony, fabulous restaurants. The hotel is vintage, but exceptionally maintained. The main hall, where there is a restaurant, bar, comfy seating, registration, and much more, envelopes you in beauty. My sister and I stayed 3 nights in a nicely appointed room, had daily cocktails in the main hall, and walked everywhere. Hotel staff were helpful and the concierge assisted us in planning our stay. Worth staying at!",nan,nan,ta_s1707
trip_advisor,"The Palmer House still evokes elegance after all these years. This is the second time I visited this hotel. My husband and I stayed for 2 nights. Our room was comfortable and clean and was located at the same floor of the executive lounge. The alcoholic beverages were not free. Only the coffee , soda and water were. The concierge and bell service were excellent. The porter who brought our suitcases down to the lobby was very kind. I particularly liked the TV history presentation of the Palmer House and how Bertha Palmer donated some valuable works of art to the Art Institute Museum of Chicago",nan,nan,ta_s1708
trip_advisor,The Palmer House is a very Grand Hotel. It has the class from years gone by and is kept us nicely. Some room are fairly small with only one double bed but there are other room that are extremely large. The staff is friendly and helpful. They have a free business center with about 5 computers. Overall a very classy place! Also a great location on State Street with lots of public transportation and restaurants nearby.,nan,nan,ta_s1709
trip_advisor,"Came to the Palmer House for a trade conference and got pretty much what I expected for a ""historic"" hotel. By that I mean the pluses are great location and some stunning architecture. What that also means is small rooms. Also disappointed that at a $200 (plus tax) per night hotel, such simple things as a coffee maker and mini-fridge were not to be found. Neither was free internet (frankly this is getting ridiculous for ANY hotel to charge for internet in this day and age). Got in early in the morning. Room was not ready but what was really nice was the woman ran my keys anyway and texted me when the room was ready--saving a return trip to the front desk and waiting in line again. Would I come again? Probably not. There are too many more modern hotels in downtown Chicago at about the same price point with bigger rooms and better ameneties.",nan,nan,ta_s1710
trip_advisor,"My boyfriend and I stayed here for one night for his birthday in beginning of May 2015. It is a beautiful, historic hotel and is a great place for a couples getaway. The lobby is breathtaking. I love the ornate details when you walk in to check out or for a drink in the lobby bar. Great location for sightseeing and shopping. I am very happy with our stay and would highly recommend anyone to stay here for one night for a piece of Chicago history!",nan,nan,ta_s1711
trip_advisor,"The location of the hotel was fine, it was very close to the Art Institute and Millennium Park, and of course near lots of restaurants.The hotel is old, originally built in the late 1800s, and some parts of the hotel retain some of that original charm.Our room was just OK. It was clean. It had a desk, the bed was comfortable. However, it was kind of cramped feeling. The bathroom especially felt small. Our room, being near the elevators, was noisy. It also seemed like a lot of light made its way in at night - from around the curtains, and under the door. It did not make for a good sleeping environment.The hotel has a pool and gym. I can't comment on the pool as I did not visit it, but I did use the gym. It was decent with plenty of cardio machines (treadmills, ellipticals, and stationary bikes) and some weight machines.",nan,nan,ta_s1712
trip_advisor,"1st of all, this isn't your standard hotel, it's connected to many other businesses inside, which is cool in itself. My husband and I stayed here May 2, 2015, to see a Cubs game and although the hotel rooms are a little dated, the overall experience is a must. The dining room is huge and looks like you are back in the 20s/30s. And it's located next to many great restaurants, we went to Italian Village, which I recommend also.",nan,nan,ta_s1713
trip_advisor,"Save your money and stay at a Motel 6, at least there you will get your money's worth and not ripped off, like I was. This Hotel is in the Heart of Downtown Chicago. The room rate was Super High for !79.00 plus taxes for Saturday and 259.00 for Sunday plus taxes ,the bad and drab amenities you will not like or enjoy. Room was falling apart from the wall paper to the nasty carpets, plugged up shower and tub drain. You could hear through the paper thin walls your neighbor flushing toilet. I will never go back to that Hotel.",nan,nan,ta_s1714
trip_advisor,"I spent three nights here while on a business trip in Chicago. Check-in was swift and pleasant. I asked about WiFi at check in. It is not complimentary which I always find disappointing, but if you ordered it there and then at the front desk you saved a couple of dollars a day. I liked this hotel. My room was on the smaller side but clean and comfortable. The only issue I had was the lack of a coffee maker in the room. I had lunch at the hotel's Potter's Lounge Bar. I sat at the bar with a friend and had a sandwich. Service was good. The sandwich was good but expensive. The hotel has an excellent location within a couple of minutes walk from both the Art Institute and Millennium Park. Not surprisingly, there are plenty of shops, restaurants, and bars nearby. I did opt for Valet Parking - again expensive but that was my choice. Check-out was a breeze as you simply left your room key in your room. I would definitely consider staying in this hotel again if I was in Chicago.",nan,nan,ta_s1715
trip_advisor,Hotel is in a great location near restaurants and theater. Shopping nearby and in the hotel. Food was good and plentiful on the 23rd floor for evening snack and breakfast. The room was lacking in attention as there were no towels and the toilet had been used and not flushed or probably not cleaned! Found someone's t-shirts left in the dresser. TV had to be reset. Expected more......at this beautiful landmark!,nan,nan,ta_s1716
trip_advisor,"I have stayed at the Palmer House a great number of times and it never disappoints. Depending the floor, there are portraits of entertainers who played the Empire Room, or historic photos of Chicago. The lobby ceiling was wonderfully restored and is something to see. The rooms might be a little on the small side, but taking into account that it is an older hotel, that makes sense, and the rooms are still very comfortable. The Palmer House is situated in the Loop and near lots of theatres, and just a bit south of the Michigan Avenue shopping district. The el drops off/picks up very nearby for most lines. For me, it is the hotel of choice when visiting Chicago.",nan,nan,ta_s1717
trip_advisor,"I was here on honeymoon for five days. On a previous trip to Chicago I had marveled at the gorgeous lobby and vowed one day to stay here. Well I did and it was decidedly average. Some of the public areas of the hotel are indeed stunning and historic, but the rooms themselves are just OK. Two things really ruined my stay here. One: there is no coffeemaker or kettle in the room. So you cannot have a morning coffee without leaving your room and running down to the Starbucks in the lower lobby, which is inconvenient and expensive. Two: it turns out this is a big convention hotel. This means that the beautiful lobby you were hoping to enjoy is constantly crammed full of conventioneers day and night. It also means that the Starbucks has a 20+ line in the mornings. On the plus side, the hotel is well located for the major sights, and is also easy to reach via public transport from the airport. If you want to have a luxury hotel experience with all the trimmings pick a different hotel to stay in. The website would have you believe that you will be transported back to an age of glamour and luxury, but the reality is that this is a convention hotel with small rooms and mediocre amenities.",nan,nan,ta_s1718
trip_advisor,"If you want a contemporary hotel experience there are multiple choices in Chicago that provide the amenities of the current times. The Palmer House survives because it exemplifies a different era. Numerous times during my weekend stay I was impressed by the commitment to retrain a hotel experience that cannot be replicated in a modern building. How easy it would be to gut the building floor by floor to compete with a new hotel. Fortunately for us, we are left with a time machine. The true allure of this 1600 room living history lesson has little to do with the architecture. The lobby is bustling, the banquet rooms are active, the staff is polished. The hotel is vibrant. I never felt like I was in a museum.Yes, I saw the stain in the wallpaper, the crack in the tile, and the line for coffee at Starbucks. It just didn't detract from my experience.",nan,nan,ta_s1719
trip_advisor,"I have been to the Palmer House Hilton for a couple of times, but this time it was not a very nice experience. I arrived late (around 9.30 - 10 pm) in February (in icy Chicago). Two entrances were closed, nobody to help with the suitcases downstairs on street level. No welcoming word from the check-in desk, the lady was as icy as the cold outside. I was given two bottles of water (as a gold HH), not very practical when you have two large suitcases (they did not have a bag). No bell boy. I checked in at executive level. The lounge was closed (most of the time I was there). Room was large but there was not even a coffe-maker in it (which is standard in the US). Next day breakfast at the executive lounge was nothing to write home about. When I later came back to have a coffee (as I did not have a coffe machine in my room) I found the lounge closed. No explanation. No time-table with opening hours. A lady came by and said they were cleaning the lounge! After three tries I just abandoned the idea of having my coffee there.Location of the Palmer House is excellent though, near to the Art Institute. The swimming pool is ok as well (nobody seems to know there is one). But that is about all I could appreciate. Don't take the executive level, it is not worth it.",nan,nan,ta_s1720
trip_advisor,"This property was selected by the company, but am glad it was. Very convenient to get to on the Orange line of the ""L"" (half a block to the side entrance). Despite the room not being ready, they have a convenient system for early check in. They give you the key, but not the room number. When the room's ready they text you the number so you don't stop by the front desk again, you head right to the room. Just one example of solid service they provide. Stay at the end of the hall of you want quiet - but realize it's a hike if you have small children or a lot of baggage. Make sure to check out the lobby, Emeral Room, etc. - all the historical aspects of the hotel. It's very easy to take the elevator from street level to your floor and miss out on the interesting parts!",nan,nan,ta_s1721
trip_advisor,"Rates: My frustration is when the rates drop as you get closer to your arrival date and you have booked a non-refundable rate! The rate dropped by $50/night!Location: Hotel is very central. If you have never been here, you will be a little confused as the main floor is on the first floor, and the escalators and elevators to the lobby/check-in are way in the back.Ambiance: The lobby ceiling is gorgeous - a must see. There is a large lobby bar and a restaurant behind it.Rooms: Although the hotel seemed quite empty, the best upgrade was on a regular room higher floor away from the L. The room was spacious but the bathroom was small. The outlets in the lamps have become loose and need work.Special Issue: I got up in the morning with an aggressive attack of allergy. Not common to me. I asked the front desk if I could change rooms. They advised that all rooms are cleaned the same way but they could try to ""de-allergify"" [My word!] my room. They thoroughly cleaned the room, changed the pillows. linen etc. No room spray, and I had a peaceful second night. It was highly appreciated!Service: Besides the superb service above, I was disappointed that my bill was wrong at check-out. I tried calling from my room and went on an unacceptably long hold. So came down and it was quickly fixed.",nan,nan,ta_s1722
trip_advisor,"As most of the reviews on here say, the hotel is beyond stately, historical and convenient. It was a great time during the nfl draft. The room was ok but was a little bit of a let down after seeing the other parts of the hotel. It was your typical hilton room but nothing over the top. I'm sure they have nicer rooms for more money but this was at the top of my budget at $300. If I had my family with me I would splurge for the larger rooms with out hesitation.",nan,nan,ta_s1723
trip_advisor,"This hotel is a beautiful, grand, stately historic building. Beyond that our room was just average at best. I was aware from reading other reviews that there is no coffee maker in the room. However the lines for coffee at Starbucks were so long we were forced to purchase coffee from room service for $9.00 a pot plus a $5.00 delivery charge. The bathroom was extremely small. For what you pay I expected to be blown away but was far from that. The Conrad Hilton is a much better choice for the price. Won't be staying at the Palmer House again.",nan,nan,ta_s1724
trip_advisor,"We got to Chicago mid day, and walked the few blocks after taking the L. First off, the Palmer House is hands down beautiful! Check in was a breeze, and we were told about all the perks of being on the Executive Level. Private key, breakfast every morning, free snacks and sodas/water....After staying on this level, there is no going back. The bed was by far the most comfortable thing we slept on our entire two week trip! So much so my husband wanted to take it with us :) The hotel is close to lots of sights and food....Go to the Irish Pub on Walbash- we ate their three times in our two nights stay! We are already planning another trip Tampa FL, and Hilton has our loyalty.",nan,nan,ta_s1725
trip_advisor,"My husband and I stayed at the Palmer House recently to celebrate my 50th birthday. We had stayed there before several years ago and found it lovely and extremely convenient to many downtown Chicago attractions. We both love grand old historic hotels, and this is definitely one of them. For the recent trip we made a reservation for a king room about three weeks before the visit through the hotel's web site. We checked in at about 1 pm (well before check-in time was supposed to even begin) and were told that no king rooms were available. We were initially told that only a double room was available. I showed the receptionist the reservation confirmation information that I had printed out. It said: Hip and Historic King, Nonsmoking confirmedShe said that the ""confirmed"" only referred to the ""nonsmoking"" part. She said she could give us a queen room. I was very disappointed with the room we ended up with; it was very small, had a view of a wall and received no daylight at all, and the bed was not what we had requested and was not that comfortable. And it was next to the service elevator.I called the front desk and asked if there was any way we could switch to a king sized room; we would be willing to pay more for it, as this was a very special occasion for us. They said they could not do that, but did take off $25 from the room rate and gave us vouchers for free breakfasts at the hotel the next morning. So I have mixed feelings. I still remember the feeling of wanting to cry when I saw the room. The room we had on our previous visit had been so much nicer, and it would have meant so much to me to have had a decent room for this special occasion. They did try to make some amends, but ultimately, what I will always remember now about that hotel was the dark tiny room and smaller than requested bed and not the free breakfast or the discount on the room.",nan,nan,ta_s1726
trip_advisor,"this is a very historic hotel with a beautiful lobby. And the meeting rooms are very large and pleasing to the eye. While I would stay here again because of the central location and proximity to the ""L."" I would like to warn everyone to things that I will be aware of next time.- Early arrival charge-$25 which I was not prepared for, but needed to get into my room to get ready for meeting.- If you are given a room on the 8th floor, be sure to ask if your room backs up to the pool. My room did, and I was not told, and when I looked out the translucent window, I realized I backed up to the indoor pool. Which by not having a window made me feel as if I was in a jail cell.My air conditioner in the room was not good. It was comfortable but not able to cool it down. And my shower had some issues along with the door.One good thing I can say is that the workout center is one of the nicest I have ever seen in a hotel.I would maybe stay here again, but I will ask many more questions. To say I am disappointed would be correct.",nan,nan,ta_s1727
trip_advisor,"On entering the hotel, we were very impressed with the opulent lobby. Our room could have done with a bit of updating & bathroom small. However, the location of the hotel is just great for reaching Chicago's main attractions. A lovely little cafe for breakfast a few doors down, considerably cheaper than in hotel. Although the train line passes the door, our room wasn't noisy. A comfortable stay.",nan,nan,ta_s1728
trip_advisor,"Upon entering the property it oozed luxury ... deep, richly colored carpeting and marble floors, beautiful central sitting and bar area with extremely high and decorated ceilings and walls, professional looking registration area, and a bank of opulent but old style elevators. We had a 2 double bed room on 20th floor (if I recall) that was HUGE. You could literally have added 2 more double beds to the room. Had not one, bt TWO walk in closets, a dresser drawer set, and a work desk. Decor wasn't particularly special, except for some antique fixtures that you may consider either charming or just old (depending on your taste). Only odd part was that the beds were just doubles and there was clearly enough room for Queen sized, or even King! Oh, and the bathroom, by comparison, was quite small. Given that the only sink was inside the bathroom, it did cause a challenge for more than one person getting ready in the morning. Location was real highlight as it is within walking distance to the Art Institute, The Bean, and local parks. Can also walk the loop. Even if you prefer to take a taxi instead of walking to further out areas, the cost is reasonable given the central location.Cost was on par or better with what I would expect (mid $200s/night) for the area. So I would consider this a good value and would stay here again.",nan,nan,ta_s1729
trip_advisor,"I love this hotel, but regrettably will never stay here again. I am a silver elite member and checked in early (11ish). The clerk asked me if I would like a room now or check in after the requisite check in time (3p). I said I would love a room now as I had to change and get ready for a big meeting. They said, well we do have rooms available, but it will cost you an additional $25 to check in early. I really could not believe they would treat a loyal Hilton Honors member this way. So, I went to the lobby bathroom, washed myself off the best I could, changed and went off to my meeting feeling that this was a low blow to such a loyal member. I will never stay at this hotel again...as lovely as it is. There are plenty other hotels that would have been happy to give en elite member (or anyone for that matter) a room early if they had it available in the name of great customer service and relationship building. Really trashy thing to do.",nan,nan,ta_s1730
trip_advisor,"I have been going to the Palmer House for about 35 years. The facility is older and well maintained. The lobby is stunning. Rooms are comfy and well appointed. If you look on the website there are times when you can book a room for a steal, for the quality of this hotel. Located one block from the Art Institute of Chicago and right near stylish State Street shops, and near the Theater District The staff are helpful and warm and the service is excellent. Parking is in a ramp across the street with in and out privileges and easy access. I love this hotel and it is my Chicago home when I am in the windy city.",nan,nan,ta_s1731
trip_advisor,My daughter and I stayed here for only one night but were very impressed by the cleanliness and updated room. We loved the old world feel of the lobby and the decor in the hallways. The hotel was very centrally located and the self parking package that we attached to our room was convenient and easy to access. The price of the room was very competitive with other hotels we were considering but the parking package made it a better deal.,nan,nan,ta_s1732
trip_advisor,"I stayed in March 2015 accompanying my husband on a business trip. We typically enjoy grand old hotels, and are not easily put off by smaller room and bathroom size. The lobby bar is beautiful, as shown in the photos, and has a nice vibe for winding down at the end of the day. Downside, drink prices a bit steep for what it is.Unfortunately, the bed and pillows were very uncomfortable. Otherwise the room was adequate, if in need of updating. The upside of this hotel is the excellent fitness center, which had great equipment and several classes offered each day. It seemed as if the fitness center was also open to members who were not guests of the hotel, which probably accounts for the high quality of amenities and classes. If a good fitness center is a priority for selecting a hotel, then this one should not be overlooked. Service at the concierge desk was also very good. The staff there was eager to help and patient with providing directions and suggestions even at busy times.",nan,nan,ta_s1733
trip_advisor,I was lucky enough to stay three glorious nights in this historic downtown hotel. The lobby is truly astounding with the old world feel! Check out the glorious ballrooms.The staff was super helpful! I want to call out Manny Batres who went out of his way in customer service! I left my Dell computer charger behind and he looked through the lost and found and brought several to my room until he found one that worked!Bravo Manny for making my stay productive! I will be back!,nan,nan,ta_s1734
trip_advisor,Stayed at the Palmer House because it was less than a block away from the Bank of America Theater. The rooms were clean and comfortable. The lobby meeting area is amazing. The area is a huge room with a bar and many sofas and tables and a high vaulted ceiling straight from the 1920s. Well worth sitting there and having a drink even if you don't stay there. Question: Why do you get free Wi-Fi at cheap motels and have to pay at expensive hotels? Just wondering.,nan,nan,ta_s1735
trip_advisor,"Palmer House Hilton is located in the middle of downtown Chicago. We were able to walk to the Art Institute of Chicago (2 blocks), Millennium Park (2 blocks), and took a short Metra train ride (the station was also about a two block walk) to the Museum complex where we were able to go to the Field Museum and the Shedd Aquarium. (We got the City Pass which I highly recommend to anyone interested in doing these types of activities.) There were many restaurants within walking distance as well. Across the street was an Italian restaurant called Vapiano that was very good. We ate at the Lockwood, the hotel restaurant, the first night. We were introduced to a new brewary there (Revolution Brewing) and the food was very good... but the waiter was so solicitous, he almost made us miss the show we had booked for the first night. Luckily the Bank of America theater was less than a block away, so we made it to The Book of Mormon with 5 minutes to spare.When I say Location: this hotel made it so we only had to take a taxi once on our whole 4 night stay. We came to the Housewares convention and went two days to that, and still were able to pack many activities in thanks to their proximity to this hotel.The staff was very nice and attentive. When we first arrived in the downstairs area, and looked lost, a staff member who was walking by not only greeted us, but accompanied us on the elevator to the desk to check in. (In fact many people in Chicago stopped and offered us directions when we were walking around looking lost. Very friendly and helpful city in general). We also spilled a drink on the bed a few nights into our stay, and someone was up to change the bedding with 5 minutes. The room itself was on the small side, but clean and the bed was comfortable. We were on the 14th floor, so we had a nice view. The lobby area has very ornate ceiling and it is decorated in a throwback style that is charming. There is a bar in this area, but it was fairly crowed, so we didn't really hang out there. Drawbacks: Wi-Fi is not free. Loud neighbors the second night who went in and out of rooms constantly (loud slamming doors). Neighbor's room service trays in hallway in morning were there the next day. Had to tell someone they were there. Shower temp was hit or miss. Some mornings tepid, some burning hot. Once went ice cold on my fiancee. Overall the Palmer House Hilton was a nice hotel. Great location, friendly and helpful staff, and comfortable bed.",nan,nan,ta_s1736
trip_advisor,"My room was generally great, especially at the price and the rating would have been higher if not for abysmally slow Wi-Fi - Hilton needs hotels to upgrade this feature and my loud neighbor with a whooping cough that woke me up at 5am. My suite was gigantic and therefore it's amazing the walls and doors were that paper thin. Otherwise, temp was good, good hotel location, clean room and a good price. The last price of feedback is the executive lounge needs to be bigger or laid out better. It was a pain to get breakfast - the selection was average.",nan,nan,ta_s1737
trip_advisor,"The lobby is very stately, but not ostentatious. We enjoyed relaxing, and drinking the lemon water while waiting for our check in. The exercise facilities are really good. In addition to the usual treadmills and stationary bikes, they also had a good selection of free weights and machines, as well as a pool, hot tub, and steam room.  We had breakfast at their restaurant, the Lockwood. The buffet was fresh and had a great selection of food, and the servers were attentive.  The hotel is within easy walking distance of Magnificent Mile, Millennium Park, and several good restaurants. The Palmer House is a credit to the Hilton Brand and to the city of Chicago.",nan,nan,ta_s1738
trip_advisor,"The hotel, the room decor and the ambiance are second to none. However . . . my wife and I booked a King Suite which comes with a wet bar. Unfortunately, the wet bar is virtually useless unless you have your room catered to by the hotel. There were no glasses, no plates, no utensils -- nothing except a small refrigerator (and no minibar). There was not even a coffee maker. I get that the hotel wants you to use room service, but not even a coffee maker? I expect more from a luxury hotel suite.",nan,nan,ta_s1739

The location is great to navigate the city! From midway you can take the Orange line to Adams/Wabash and you are right there at the entrance of the hotel! The Art Institute is a block and a half away, the bean is close by, so is the magnificent mile as well as the red line for the subway is just steps away from the entrance on State, this hotel is fabulous! The hotel itself is gorgeous, the beds are comfy and so are the pillows, there's lots of shops, conveniences like a Starbucks and a gorgeous lounge and dining room, make sure you look up and appreciate the ceiling!The hotel has everything, the staff is top notch! One in particular that stands out is DJ the doormen that had recommended places to eat, things to do and always greeted us with a smile and willingness to help us find our way around the city! Did I mention he suggested the best tiramisu I've ever had in my life!!! I leave Chicago tomorrow (March 23, 2015) and I'm already starting to plan my next trip back to explore this city even more!!!P.s. If you see DJ (you can't miss him he's tall, with a great smile and broad shouldered) ask him for tips about the city, you won't be disappointed!!!!",nan,nan,ta_s1740

We wanted to see if we could figure out how to get from Midway to hotel on the train vs cab simply as an adventure or challenge. So much for the challenge....every time we stopped to study a map, a helpful and friendly local would volunteer info! What a wonderful city!It was an easy ride on the Orange line to Adams/Wabash. The hardest part was actually finding the lobby to hotel. It's hidden among shops without an obvious sign. The lobby is on the second floor. We had reserved with points, and although I had a confirmation number, my reservation wasn't confirmed with the hotel. We had dinner reservations in just a couple of hours, so we almost began to panic, but the front desk clerk was very reassuring that all would work out. They upgraded us to executive floor which included free breakfast and all day snacks. We were on the TOP floor, which could have been amazing, but with a courtyard view, it means we simply looked across at the other rooms on the 23rd floor. Not that we we weren't grateful....just saying if you request a high floor, be sure to request a city view. The rooms are historic, but beautifully updated. Housekeeping staff was efficient, polite and professional. Left the room sparkling clean without over spraying fragrance. So nice to return to a clean room!Had high tea at Lockwood in hotel. Look for review.",nan,nan,ta_s1741
trip_advisor,"Like so many other reviews, I arrived knowing I got a good deal and that the location is hard to beat. We were there for the last shopping weekend before Christmas and the energy and crowds didn't disappoint. With that said, the check in lines were extremely long when we got to the hotel. Lucky for us - and kudos to the staff - the Palmer provided lines for HiltonHonor members so we were treated to a quick check in. The hotel is amazing. Grand lobby, old wood finishes, decor that transports you back to another time. The room will do the same as it is old, small and ""historic"" - so code for a bit outdated but tolerable given your surroundings. The bath had everything you would want, the room was clean and there was plenty of water pressure (and hot water). The location was great. If you are willing to walk in the cold, stay here at Christmas time and you can easily walk to - Grant Park where you can ice skate, Michigan ave shopping, the German market in the plaza and all the food and drinking you can manage. Check out was as easy as check in and the nearby parking - which was a concern going in - was easily navigated and managed. We will stay here again...",nan,nan,ta_s1742

My room stank, I constantly heard the people in the next room having a normal conversation, and the bathroom was so small I could not turn around without hitting the wall. On top of it all I was staying here on Business and the hotel was part of the conference I was attending and they charged me $10 a day for internet. That is taking advantage of the customer. In this day and age you cannot do without it so you have no choice but to pay their price. I would not stay at this hotel again.",nan,nan,ta_s1743

We stayed with the chillcation package and got free breakfast buffet, which was very good, and 50% discount on parking. We loved the hotel... Except both mornings there was no hot water for a shower. First morning the hot water was available after 10am and this threw a wrench in our plans for the day. The second morning we got up at 600 hoping for a better result, but alas the shower that started tepid quickly turned to ice.Not what I would expect from a hotel in this category and at this price point.",nan,nan,ta_s1744
trip_advisor,"The gilded age becomes your stage when staying at the Palmer House. Beautiful neoclassical details surround you in pure decadent luxury. From the peacock-motif hallway carpets to the ornately detailed lobby with its hand-painted ceiling, you truly feel as if you've stepped into another era. Our room was fantastic, with two washrooms and a sitting area, and the staff were pros at going above and beyond to offer excellent service. Starbucks is on hand in the morning, and a pool and hot tub offer relaxation at the end of a long day visiting museums. And the location! Within walking distance to the Bean, Millenium Park, the Art Institute, Chicago Cultural Center and Bergoff's. A true delight, the Palmer House offers convenience, luxury and great service, all without pretention. We will definitely book again!",nan,nan,ta_s1745
trip_advisor,"This is a beautiful old hotel that has been nicely refurbished. I was upgraded to a Hilton floor room and it was quite large with two bathrooms. I suspect this is an exception and that most of the rooms are smaller. I am in a room with an adjoining door and my next door neighbors are relatively noisy and I can hear them having a good time, so ask for a room that doesn't have the door. The room service breakfast was good and arrived early. The room is newly and tastefully decorated. The bed is too soft, but the linens are nice. If you push them a bit they are likely to comp you wifi. I would definitely consider staying here if you are in Chicago.",nan,nan,ta_s1746
trip_advisor,"I tell my family if they ever wonder where I went, I may be at The Palmer House. Their lobby alone is worth the stay. I have visited many times during my lifetime and will continue to only stay at The Palmer House when in Chicago. Their service is unparalleled, the lobby and bar- iconic and the rooms- spacious & updated. Ask for the 2 bed/2 bath- and the Executive floor is a great value, especially if traveling as a family or group. Enjoy!",nan,nan,ta_s1747
trip_advisor,"The Palmer House is a stately older Hilton located in loop downtown area of Chicago. Decor is Art Deco and the lobby is on a grand scale. Rooms tend to be a bit on the smaller side, and could use some updating. However, has all of the modern conveniences and right in the central bbusiness dstrict with closeby shopping, eentertainment and restaurants. The loobby bar is also great, and Tim the bartender gets 5 stars.. You can also order food from the Lockwood fine dining restaurant while at the bar, or just order from the bar menu. My wife and I stayed for 2 nights while on business, and I'll come back! he shopped during the day, and acy''s/Nordstrom's are closeby within walking distance.",nan,nan,ta_s1748
trip_advisor,"I spend a week in this hotel during New Year day. Location is ideal for exploring Chicago. You are close to the lake, little bit further to downtown. You have subway station next to the hotel with many fast foods, so great for me. I would say rooms are vintage, it means they are old and small, typical for old Chicago, so if you love this style, you will love the whole hotel. The view from room was very nice. Palmer House Hilton has the greatest lobby I've ever seen, you need to see it even if you are not accommodated in the hotel.But there is really bad situated front desk! I wouldn't find front desk without help! It is somehow in first floor and you can reach it only with tiny escalators (with all the baggage). One more thing - paid Wi-Fi...?!?! Really?!Anyway i would definitely came back again.",nan,nan,ta_s1749
trip_advisor,"Had a rather poor experience with our stay at this hotel from the minute we got out of the car until we left. Combative doorman almost had a fist fight with our driver over the luggage cart, confused checkin process and a long wait to be processed.Concierge refused to help accept deliveries and to hold items for delivery to the room...received very un customer friendly responses to our requests. Elevators were often over crowded or non operational during peak hours forcing us to use the service lifts in order to get to and from the room. Rooms were incredibly small and had views of the alley. We had a drunk try to break into the room at 3AM causing considerable stress for my wife.Not worth the money we paid...better options around the corner; the only plus for the hotel is the location.",nan,nan,ta_s1750
trip_advisor,"Stayed with family over Christmas and it has a charm that cannot be matched by any other hotel in Chicago. The lobby is beautiful, amazing really. But upon check in our rooms weren't ready, so we headed to the lobby's bar. Drinks are over $10 and it would have been a nice gesture if the hotel would have comped these since we were waiting on them. When I did say something to the front desk about the delay (two bloody marys later) they did offer us breakfast. But over an hour was too long to wait to check in, AND it was after 5pm. I would have given this hotel a four, but these things should be anticipated by the hotel.",nan,nan,ta_s1751
trip_advisor,"I am currently typing this review from their room. I really want to love this hotel, I truly do. First, the lobby is absolutely gorgeous. Location you cannot beat. Room is really pleasant. For a Hilton it shows great disappointment though. Quality, is a miss. The devils is in the details. They do charge for wifi in the room, which I can live with. Some things are a bit outdated, phone near the bed does not function. But a standard room does not come with a fridge. Motel 8 has a fridge, there is a clear imprint on the floor of a fridge having lived there.I feel that they removed the fridge and wanted more money for the conference. I would give it a 1, but with location I had to bump it up. Once I return to Chicago, I will look into other options more carefully, (Marriot, Westin, etc.). This hotel totally changed my view for Hilton.",nan,nan,ta_s1752
trip_advisor,"I'm a Diamond Hilton Honors member and was surprised to find... PUBIC HAIRS IN THE SHOWER. After asking for the shower to be cleaned, I instead received two pairs of bath slippers. And still a dirty shower! I complained and was told that one of the managers would be notified. Then I was offered a free water and breakfast, which I already get free. Useless. Needing a recharge on my electronics, I plugged in my laptop only to find that the power outlets were not working. So my laptop died. Lame. Never staying at this disgusting place again.DO. NOT. STAY. HERE.",nan,nan,ta_s1753
trip_advisor,"historic hotel, good food at restaurant (Lockwood) and bar (Potters). The Executive floor (22 & 23) rooms are basic but good. The executive floor (23) lounge is large and comfortable with decent food for breakfast, appetizers and snacks. Some rooms are near the CTA tracks which might bother you. I was in 23/216 and the trains ran regularly. I noticed them but they didn't bother me. The shower head is unique, it pivots and has two heads and it works well enough.",nan,nan,ta_s1754
trip_advisor,"The good first - the location cannot be beat if you will be working or staying in the Loop area; it is very convenient. Also, the staff is very helpful and responsive. Now the cons - this is a very large hotel - 1600+ rooms, and very old hotel too. if you like very old style hotels that once were spectacular but that now badly need renovating, then this one's for you. The rooms are very variable in size and comfort. We were originally placed in a very very small room, that was simply too small for 2 people. After much fussing, we moved to a larger room, with 2 bathrooms and that improved the room situation. Housekeeping left a little to be desired, missed a few things one day. Overall, there are better hotels in Chicago that are more up to date and more comfortable.",nan,nan,ta_s1755
trip_advisor,"I stayed here at the hotel for a convention my husband was attending for a week. Everything that you need is all around you (stores, clothing retail, restaurants). thank goodness for nearby retail because we were not prepared for the cool weather. this place has a wonderful charm to it and we found our room to be very clean. it did have a tinge of smell but i kind of expect that from an older building. the gym was kept up nicely, had good equipment all around, and was a little bigger than expected. the nearby train makes it a bit noisy but maybe since our room was closer to State Street made it less of a nuisance. I had just wished there was a refrigerator in our room. the restaurants we ate at were always huge portion and with no fridge we had to throw a lot of food away. I felt so sad to leave such a wonderful hotel. it was really comfortable. Except i had forgotten a few articles in the safe. i called from the airport and left my information to have someone call me back. i did receive a call from security and was told that they did have my items but that i needed to forward them a copy of my ID to retrieve them. i faxed them the info and supplied additional info to confirm that the items belong to me. i was told that security would mail my items (spoke to a guy name Manny) but weeks passed and nothing!! what was the purpose of sending my personal information and now i have no idea what they are doing with it!!!",nan,nan,ta_s1756
trip_advisor,"My stay was a combination business/pleasure trip, and it hit the mark on both counts. I stayed on the Exec. Level floor which, for just a little more than standard rates, is a great deal. The Wifi is free and there is a breakfast, daytime snacks and soft drinks etc. all throughout the day. There are nice seating/meeting spaces there as well. The room was generously sized and comfortable. Housekeeping was a little slow, and there was no evening turn down service. The hotel lobby is quite spectacular, very old european style with a grand lobby and amazing ceiling painting. The hotel has a lot of history, since it is over 150 years old I'm told. All the staff were friendly and accomodating and, given the price, I found it to be a solid value. If you want something other than the many ""modern"" hotels with more hip euro-style furnishings and decor, but still centrally located in the loop, Palmer might be the place for you. It was for me and I would return there.",nan,nan,ta_s1757
trip_advisor,"I have stayed here three times and never been disappointed. Staff are courteous and helpful we always feel relaxed and comfortable. The rooms are spacious and clean. Great location for everything, tried the drake in September 2014 and staff unfriendly especially reception wouldn't go back there.I will be back in May this year and will look forward to my stay at Palmer House. Will always stay here if possible we visit Chicago usually once a year for last six years and hopefully will continue to do so for many years.I cannot recommend this hotel highly enough its always a pleasure.",nan,nan,ta_s1758
trip_advisor,The Palmer House Hotel is a true classic hotel. The location is ideal. The check in team was excellent. The rooms were clean and really good sized compared to say the Hilton Towers. Now the reason for only a 4 dot rating. The rooms are starting to show their age w wallpaper peeling off the walls in the room and bathroom. The rooms were quiet and comfortable. It was very easy to get cabs or uber. This hotel is right off an L stop. I can't comment on the restaurant because we didn't stay to eat there. Very nice hotel you will not be disappointed.,nan,nan,ta_s1759
trip_advisor,"On my second visit to this bueatiful city I couldn't have stayed in a better place. Centrally located, served by public transport, main attractions within a stones throw and surrounded by plenty of eateries/restaurants its heaven for a tourist on a short visitThe hotel has architecturally rewarding ornate main bar which can rival any grade I listed building in the UKThe rooms are spacious with good wifi connection, spa is well run, steam oozing hot and they even provide dispisable razors ...need I add any moreThoughly enjoyed the stay",nan,nan,ta_s1760
trip_advisor,"The traditional jewels originating this incredible property are alive! Everything is simply new again with revitalized original decor and style along with legendary service at every step throughout! The property is breathtaking and the rooms totally revamped to offer the glory that other hotels can't even imagine no matter how hard they try (for example the Andaz...losers!) The location is unbeatably close to the mellinial park, museums and magnificent mile shopping. Doormen great you and taxis are never a wait. This service culture flows through the blood of this traditional facility. Even Mathew, in security, saved the trip by retrieving and shipping our left behind cell phone....and he was even HAPPY to help! That is just one great example of how the entire staff is determined to make personal connection and build everlasting relationships with their guests! The bar and its vaulted and ornate ceiling sets an evironment that is the heart of the social atmosphere. The attendants are eager to serve. The convention facilities are unmatched along with the details that differentiate this great gem. Congrats to the Palmer House for setting the standard! I think I might have heard Andy Williams and Frank Sinatra having a chat somewhere within this timeless and perfect place!",nan,nan,ta_s1762
trip_advisor,"this is one of the grand old hotels of the city. if you are looking for something that is not ""cookie-cutter"" this is it. starting with its grand lobby and going up through the nice sized rooms, this is a really good place. super staff - everything about this place is really great. rooms are clean, comfortable and nice sized. great location inside the loop and within a block of an elevated train station. rates were good, location was good, conceirge lounge is top-flight. no complaints whatsoever. i will stay here again",nan,nan,ta_s1763
trip_advisor,"The Palmer House really is a classic grand hotel.When you arrive and enter the lobby you're greeted by a massive grand room with amazing ceilings. Lots of space to enjoy a drink, have a chat or get some work done on the fly.I've stayed here twice - both times for a business conference - and each time the thing that made the experience most memorable was the staff. Everyone is incredibly kind and professional.While the lobby, mezzanine and conference rooms (4th Floor) are spotless, I found the hallways to be dirty. The carpets were quite messy both times I stayed and on my most recent trip last week, there was garbage on the floor outside my room.The rooms themselves are very clean. Bathrooms are spotless, carpets are tidy and not a speck of dust to be found.While clean, the rooms are all very different. As is the case with many old hotels, all the rooms have different sized bathrooms and main rooms. For example, my bathroom this year was half the size of my bathroom last year and in order to close the door to bathroom I almost had to step into the shower.Another thing some colleagues complained about was the sound of the L trains that runs along S Wabash Ave right next to the hotel. I like white noise as it helps me sleep and had the benefit this year of being on the 20th floor however the lower you go the louder it gets. My suggestion is if you want to avoid the noise either give up the view and ask for an interior room for a room on a higher floor.",nan,nan,ta_s1764
trip_advisor,"We stayed here right before X-mas 2014. The hotel was having a ton of construction done so it was a bit hectic. BUT the staff was great, very helpful and attentive. The bar area is georgeous and we sat out there both nights. Great location but one problem we had (throughout Chicago), our GPS on our phones did not work. Not sure why but we spent much of the trip lost!You will really like the hotel, though!",nan,nan,ta_s1765
trip_advisor,"I really enjoyed my stay here. The hotel staff was very good (the staff at the lobby bars wasn't really that great), and the check-in and checkout processes were smooth. The lounge area is fantastic and a place to just sit and enjoy. The rooms were fine. A bit dated, but given the age of the hotel, certainly acceptable. The bed was great and the room an ample size. The internet in the common areas was about what you expect - slow and somewhat unreliable, but it was free outside of your guest room.As an added bonus, there is a Starbucks in the building, so you don't need to venture outside in the harsh winter months - assuming you like Starbucks that is.",nan,nan,ta_s1766
trip_advisor,"This hotel is a beautiful historic hotel in a perfect location for our needs. I greatly enjoyed the historical facts in the elevator. There are several meal options in and near the hotel and the rooms are nice and clean. We did have trouble with several of their direct reservation agents. The first one gave us the group discount on only 1 room of our block.The next one caught the error and added the discount to the rooms that were available (but, it wasn't available on one). Then I spent 20 minutes (twice) on the phone attempting to cancel a room from our group about a week before the trip. One agent seemed to switch the names on the reservation (double vs single rooms) At the end of the trip, I only received a receipt for 1 room. (free internet in lobby)",nan,nan,ta_s1767

The room we had was a bit small but the king bed and pillows were really comfortable, which was kinda important for us after a whole day walking in February's cold weather. Hotel is very close to the Millennium Park and the Art Institute (about 10 minutes walk), and has a Macy's, a CVS and a lot of places to shop and dine nearby. And even the Skydeck and Magnificent Mile are within walking distance! The only problem was that there were no complimentary bottle water in the hotel if you're not a hilton member. In room wifi is not complimentary but they have free wifi in the lobby although we found it crowded and noisy at night, maybe because we went during the V-day weekend.",nan,nan,ta_s1768

Old, run down, small rooms that are dirty and that do not even have an ipod dock nor is one available at the desk. Requested a quiet larger room and got a very noisy tiny room. The girl at check in informed me of the nice view ...it was a dumpster and a roof below. Staff is very, very rude and abrupt. Absolutely the worst hotel experience i have ever had. Please save your money and stay home or go to another hotel in the area...this one is just awful.",nan,nan,ta_s1769

I really like that you can use the stairs at this hotel. The workout area, pool, and hot tube are nice amentities. I did have some trouble finding outlets and the lamp outlets barely worked on the bedside table. I would recommend not getting a king bed as the room is really small then. Two doubles was nice sized. A trick to the hotel is not using main set of elevators, but the second set around the corner that goes to street level; you can get on the elevator faster.",nan,nan,ta_s1770
trip_advisor,"This is an amazing historic hotel with a fascinating and grandiose lobby! Lots of history here...Enjoyed having access to the large gym (included for hotel guests) and swimming pool.The rooms are just okay -- as you might expect from a hotel built >100 years ago, the standard king room is on the smaller side, with the bathroom being absolutely tiny (hard to navigate if you want to close/open the door). Also, the walls are a little thin and you may hear people in the next room. That said, the bed is comfy and it's generally well styled / maintained.We had breakfast at the Lockwood restaurant -- very good buffet option. Nice coffee. Great waiter (Tony).",nan,nan,ta_s1771
trip_advisor,"I've stayed at the Palmer house on business on many occasions, and whilst I like the architecture, the main hall / reception has a wonderful ceiling, the hotel does often struggle. It seems to be a mecca for conferences / auditions or other activities that seem to attract thousands of school children, so every night the bar surrounds just seem to be filled with children (this time it was dance auditions followed by children's UN style meetings) which is very disconcerting and not what you expect. This time I had a split booking as my stay was extended, when I checked in I was told I would need to check out the next morning and check in again! You also need to be careful of noise, the hotel boarders the loop, and some of the rooms suffer badly with that, if you are disturbed by noise you need to be around the central courtyard",nan,nan,ta_s1772

Although I've been to Lockwood (their restaurant) many times, I've never had the chance to stay the night. Beautiful room and very comfortable beds.

Tip, If you can book in July, they have great rates!",nan,nan,ta_s1773
trip_advisor,"The hotel itself is beautiful, the lobby is stunning and the entranceways and exits are beautiful, though they're a pain in the butt to get through with the crowds (We travelled over Thanksgiving). The rooms are small, but I guess that's to be expected in a big city (they're still bigger than in New York) The front desk staff was average in terms of helpfulness, but the concierge was very nice and gave advice with a smile. The bed in our room was very comfortable and the room itself was cozy, even though it was small. As for location, it was perfect. Close to Millenium Park, the Bean, the ice-skating rink, the Magnificent Mile, and tons of restaurants. For the price it was a very good decision; I would stay here again if we travelled back to Chicago. Be careful with taxis from O'Hare to Midway, they will not hesitate to rip you off!",nan,nan,ta_s1774
trip_advisor,"My favorite hotel in Chicago, but not what it was before the company went public. Location is excellent, Ernest in the Executive Lounge is a delight, already peeled hard-boiled eggs on the Continental breakfast put other Hilton properties to shame and the lobby speaks for itself.Some of the really bad reviews I see here make no sense: people should expect small rooms for the lowest price at a 140-year-old hotel, diamond HHonors members get FREE access to the Continental breakfast in the Executive Lounge and the executive floors were remodeled last year.On the other hand: cleanliness has suffered and some very good staff have departed. Too bad.Oh, and the restaurants are not even to be considered; just go out any door and look around.And yet: location, price, location, price, location!",nan,nan,ta_s1775
trip_advisor,"I recently stayed here with my family, the first time I had stayed here since the mid 1980s. The Palmer House is a classic Chicago hotel with a stunning lobby and other public areas. We chose a plan with breakfast included which was a good deal, and we had a great stay. It is a short walk to most downtown Chicago attractions and a short cab ride to others. Our room wasn't yet ready when we wanted to check in so they gave us a $50 voucher which we later used for some room service. Our room had 2 bathrooms which are super tiny but nicely furnished, and was almost like a small suite. We loved the historic feel of the property, something you don't find in a modern sleek building. Also kudos to the bell staff who happily helped us with our 7 large suitcases and getting a taxi to the airport.",nan,nan,ta_s1776
trip_advisor,"As a Hilton Gold Member, perhaps my standards are not as high as some of the other reviewers of this hotel, but I love it! I've stayed at the Palmer House many times and have always had a very positive experience. There is no better location if you are visiting the Art Institute, Millennium Park, Shedd Aquarium, Grant Park, etc. We always stay at the Palmer House when visiting the Art Institute, which is what this trip was for. I booked a room with 2 bathrooms (a blessing when 2 women are traveling together). My stay already included breakfast, but when we checked in, I asked if we would be able to take advantage of the ""cocktail hour"" that is offered on the Executive floors. Without blinking an eye, our hostess Tatianna moved us from the 17th floor to the 22nd, with only a $5 increase per night. I seem to always get Tatianna when I check in and I can't say enough about how helpful, sweet and professional she is. I realize the Palmer House is old...it's a historic building for goodness sake! I still find it to be one of the most comfortable and homey of the Hilton hotels. If it's too expensive, look for the off season rates, they're very reasonable and you'll be able to treat yourself to a little bit of luxury.",nan,nan,ta_s1777
trip_advisor,"As a hilton diamond member, I spend many nights at hilton properties all over the world each year and can easily say this is by far the worst hilton I have stayed at. While the building itself is nice, the rest does not meet the hilton standard: low ceiling and old room on the exec floor - suffocating!! Terrible breakfast buffet for $30 and parking for $60 a night!! Service is terrible, staff charged me the wifi by mistake, did not apologize and seem bothered to have to correct the bill.

The corridors of the rooms are lined with photos of the wonderful stars from the 50's through the 80's who performed at the Palmer House. Nonetheless, their music is ignored in favor of thumping, overly loud and offensive music making use of the public spaces impossible. Do not plan to spend any time in the gorgeous lobby. Complaints were received with laughter.",nan,nan,ta_s1779

I was in a standard room. + central location+ beautiful atrium downstairs + cleanDownsides for me where...- PAPER THIN WALLS - made worse by my neighbours screaming arguments- Small bed!! One thing I love about the US is the giant beds - no no, not here. Roughly the size of a uk double or smaller- huge - always a queue at reception. Always. Always. I felt like I was in a super market- internet did not work on two devices despite me paying the extra. Instead I had to pay twice then beg and barter for a refundI was not wild about the recently redone decor. It was a bit cheap / tacky. The bathroom was tired and clearly omitted from whatever refurb had taken place. Overall it was, as the title of my review, just OK.",nan,nan,ta_s1780
trip_advisor,"This is a great hotel. The staff was nice and the property is beautiful. The hotel lobby was a bit confusing, the check in desk is on the 2nd floor.

My room was upgraded to a double and the room was huge. It had two closets and enough walking space to so a Zumba class! Everything was great. Free wifi in the lobby, the octopus salad from the bar was amazing, and the hotel security was right on point! They came up to us at the bar to make sure our purses were not hanging off of our chairs. They instructed us to use the purse hooks under the bar. Two negatives: no refrigerator in the room and UPS charged me a handling fee to have a package shipped. Most hotels usually don't charge to have a package shipped to your room. I guess it's because UPS has a store location in the hotel. Great hotel and would stay again!",nan,nan,ta_s1782
trip_advisor,"Stayed for one night over Christmas weekend, hotel was decked-out in holiday splendor and is one of my favorite classic hotels. This is a huge hotel & they pack them in with great rates over the holidays.The location & parking are great for downtown Chicago (ramp across the street is $40-$45 per day with in/out privileges).We were on the 19th floor & the crowds made the elevators serving the 18 floors + extremely busy (saw some 10 minute and longer waits). We took the less-busy 1-17 floor elevators and walked up 2 floors. Also took the stairs down-helps work off some of the holiday sweets....Tip #2 - no coffee in room (disappointing) and unlike other non ""in-room"" hotels, no free service in lobby for guests. Plus, the Starbucks on the ground floor typically had a 10-15 minute line. Answer: go to the Freshii's on the other side of the ground floor, no wait & a big (only one size) coffee was $2.20. Even gave an extra cup so could share with wife back in the room.Rooms were nice (we had a good-sized king) and staff was excellent. We had the bad misfortune of being next to a suite that became party-central for a group of friends at bar-time. The front desk sent security up & things calmed down (from shouting to loud talking) but still made for a lousy night's sleep. The front desk compensated us at check-out with a discount, but better plan would have had other members of this group in the adjoining room vs us.....not sure if check-in staff is schooled to think about this, but something to consider.Pool is small & OK for kids splashing, but that is about it. Nice health club, but did not get a chance to use.",nan,nan,ta_s1783

Every staff member was friendly and eager to help, from the check in to the concierge. Ate at the restaurant, and it was fabulous! Try the duck. We asked for a coffee maker and it was in the room in 5 minutes by a smiling staff member, and it was restocked the next day as well. The lobby bar was like having a drink in the Vatican, beautiful decorations for Christmas as well as the indescribable ceiling. All in all, can't wait to return, and many thanks to the staff who really are what made this a memorable holiday!",nan,nan,ta_s1784
trip_advisor,"We stayed at the Palmer House for a brief weekend trip to Chicago. It was pleasant enough, but the lobby is so large it is a bit easy to lose track of kids and difficult to communicate with others in the party. Beautiful, but not very functional. Our room was nice and we enjoyed the staff, but the hotel was a bit unmanageable for our four-person party. It can be a little loud and drafty - to be expected for a historical hotel, but worth noting. We will probably choose something a bit smaller for our next visit.",nan,nan,ta_s1785
trip_advisor,"A complete rip off for the price. Paint was chipping off multiple walls and doors in the room. No bottom sheet was placed on the bed, the comforter was stained and even on the 8th floor I had a view of a brick wall. The bathroom was small and cramped and the tv channels came in fuzzy. What a total disappointment. You can clearly hear your neighbors and people in the hall. Wifi is an extra 10 dollars in the room. Caution: they charge extra for everything.",nan,nan,ta_s1787
trip_advisor,"Nice hotel, maybe a bit overwhelming if you are accustomed to staying at the places in the country. Very interesting main floor lobby with an awesome ceiling. After only one night, I don't know all it has to offer. My room seemed small and there was no coffee maker, but this is old school Chicago. It was comfortable and one or two people in the room would be fine if you are interested in being in this hotel/area.",nan,nan,ta_s1788

At the moment, I'm sitting in my beautiful 1,000+ sq ft suite, but I can't get any service (besides the incredibly maid service...shout out to Natividad!).The personality and personel of the hotel is severly lacking. The support staff (front desk, door men, concierge) don't care about what you want or need as a guest. Once your 'in house', you're in.Too bad for them...I'm a huge Hilton guy, but I hold grudges in a way that could be considered liable. This place is no better than the Hampton; just a pretty facade. Goodbye and Goodluck!Christopher Walls",nan,nan,ta_s1789
trip_advisor,"My overall experience with this hotel has been excellent on several occasions. During my last visit, the check in for our group (20+ rooms) was as easy as it could have been. Many were able to get into their room before the check in time (and they were sold out the night prior). I didn't mind waiting in the gorgeous lobby just relaxing and people-watching. The room was nicely furnished and very comfortable. The concierge was AMAZING. I can't recall her name now, but she went well beyond polite. She was sincerely friendly, helpful, and made great suggestions for restaurants (and provided walking directions on a map). The sales staff (Michael W. and Velia T.) are incredible to work with. It was really great to be able to leave our luggage on the main floor while we waited for our room and when we checked out prior to boarding our bus for home. It's in a great location as well; easy to walk to many popular sites and an array of restaurants. Looking forward to another stay at this fabulous property!",nan,nan,ta_s1790
trip_advisor,"I stayed at the Palmer house on a recent business trip. I had never stayed here before, but as I walked into the lobby, I was amazed. Absolutely beautiful lobby, with the classic arching ceilings. The hotel was also decked out with Christmas decorations, so it was even more spectacular to me.Check in was smooth and quick. However, as I got to my room, I was pretty disappointed. I knew the hotel was old, but was hoping the rooms were kept up to date. My room wasn't. It felt old...really old. Not the good old either. It had a light musty and, well, old smell. The room was very small and the bathroom tiny. I could barely take more than two steps inside the bathroom. I would say that I ""shifted"" more than stepped while in the bathroom.",nan,nan,ta_s1791
trip_advisor,"For an upscale hotel, we had two very unpleasant experiences in our room, which I believe is a housekeeping issue. 1) someone had previously used the shower curtain to wipe themselves; excrement was visible and smelly on the curtain; and 2) pleasure items were in a box sticking out from under the bed. #1 was discovered the morning after arriving as we got in late and let the front desk know. We were told we would be credited back that night's stay; and when the sex toys were found and I brought them to the front desk wrapped in a towel to present to the manager and we were told both nights would be free.... neither credit has been received to date.... Word to the wise, check your room immediately. This type of hotel should have impeccable cleanliness in their rooms... we're going to give them one more chance when we return for another Broadway show... hopefully they will have cleaned up their act by then.",nan,nan,ta_s1792
trip_advisor,"This was the most wonderful trip of my life...I live in Sarasota and have volunteered at Christmastime at Historic Spanish Point, formerly past of Bertha Potter Palmer's Florida estate here on the Suncoast, so my son thoughtfully reserved my stay at Palmer House for me. It was beyond a dream come true and I will return there whenever I return to visit Chicago. Thank you for making this such a memorable occasion! Well done!",nan,nan,ta_s1793
trip_advisor,"Absolutely beautiful historical hotel - a rare find - and the hotel staff was extremely helpful and friendly. ""If only the walls could talk"" was my thought as I walked through these beautiful ballrooms and hallways admiring the fulfillment of Mr. Palmer's dream and the history that has taken place on this location since that time. Shopping and museums are easily reached from this hotel location and the staff is eager to assist you with any questions or issues you may have.",nan,nan,ta_s1794
trip_advisor,"This is a lovely hotel. The decor is very lavish, yet doesn't come across as pretentious. At checkin, I was asked if I wanted foam pillows. I said that I did and was told that they would be brought up immediately. They never did arrive. The wallpaper was peeling in the bathroom, which gave the room a cheaper feel. I would have had an excellent night's sleep, but my neighbors had others plans - instead of nicely closing doors in the wee hours of the night, they would just let them slam closed. They make products to stop this from happeneing...the Palmer would benefit greatly from investing in installing them.",nan,nan,ta_s1795
trip_advisor,"....Those walls are WAYYYYY thin. Next to us there were two couples who wanted to talk into the night. Fine--but it seemed that they were in the room with us. We finally got to sleep around one. The first time we called, Security came up but the second time they just offered to move us. I love the Palmer House and plan to stay there again, but be forewarned: You may get talkers next door, and your sleep will be compromised.",nan,nan,ta_s1796
trip_advisor,"We stayed here for our annual Farm Bureau the service was awesome from housekeeping to the cleanliness of the property. One man in particular was Antonio Legrier. He was sweeping area around doorway entrances he took such great detail in his work and was proud of the Palmer House. He took time to talk to a group of us asking why we were there, if we needed any directions, was there anything we needed. Thank you Antonio, you were a bright star on our trip. Palmer house, you have a true and valuable employee.",nan,nan,ta_s1797
trip_advisor,"My third stay at this iconic hotel in Chicago. I never get tired of this place. The Lobby Bar is a great place to relax after a long day. The bar staff is excellent and welcomed back the crew I was with. For an old hotel in the heart of Chicago it still holds it's glamour. If you are into shopping, there is no better place than State St and surrounding area, with 10 story Macy's. The Art Institute of Chicago is just a short walk away with the Bean near bye. Great location for your Chicago stay.",nan,nan,ta_s1798
trip_advisor,Every December for the last 6 years my wife and daughter have stayed at the Palmer House for their annual Chicago shopping trip. The staff is very professional and friendly. It is very important to me that wherever they say on this trip they are well cared for. The Palmer House staff (Olivia on their most recent trip) have always taken good care of my family. Dean Lane runs a great hotel. They have always been given a nice room but their most recent stay was one of the best. They were given a room with two beds and most importantly two bathrooms! This really reduced their prep time so they could spend more time shopping. :-) The stores the shop are all within walking distance of the hotel. They usually fly in to Midway and take the train to the hotel.We'll be booking next year's trip soon.,nan,nan,ta_s1799
trip_advisor,"While visiting Chicago over Thanksgiving, my boyfriend and I got engaged. He proposed to me in the Palmer hotel, which had the Christmas tree up and all the lights. It was wonderful. But two things happened which dampened our stay here - so that we won't stay here again. Seconds after we got engaged, we needed a picture taken. We were standing in the main lobby. Paul spied a waiter (it wasn't very busy) and asked him to take a photo. The waiter said ""maybe,"" then proceeded to walk away. Ok, we asked a customer sitting at the bar, who was happy to oblige. The waiter never came over. The timing wasn't perfect, but my boyfriend proposed while I was sick with a head cold. So we went up to the room, which was fine, and he ran out to get me tea and soup. When all the places (including Starbucks) closed and he could no longer get me tea, he requested from room service that they bring up a hot pot of water (or a glass!) while he forayed out to find a Walgreen's for cold medication. It's not that they brought the water late - IT'S THAT THEY NEVER BROUGHT THE WATER AT ALL. If you aren't going to provide a service, just say so! The cold was really bad - I was expecting relief and got NONE. Finally, although we requested a quiet room, they put us in a room where we could hear the El - all night long. Ugh. Don't get me wrong: I love the El. But not when I'm sick, and when we just got engaged. Not cool, Palmer House. I'm a long-time, repeat customer, but if you're looking to make folks who have loved you in the past keep coming back, don't treat them like this.",nan,nan,ta_s1800
trip_advisor,"While visiting WI, my girlfriend and I decided to take a trip to Chicago for the day and spend the night. Based on other reviews and the location, the Conrad Chicago was an easy choice. The self-parking was very simple and stepping into lobby for the first time was an experience all to itself; absolutely stunning and the fruit infused water was a nice start. Check-in was smooth and the room itself was awesome. When booking our reservation, we were asked for the nature of our travel, which was vacation and to celebrate an anniversary. We were welcomed to some chocolate covered strawberries, some refreshments, and a congratulatory card welcoming us to the hotel - now that is service! As others have mentioned, the bathroom was nothing short of incredible and we were more than okay with the view of the Magnificent Mile. The bed was awesome and we both slept in much later than we usually do. All in all, it was a great stay from start to finish and we were both very sad to be leaving the Conrad Chicago. Thank you again for a very memorable stay!",nan,nan,ta_s1801
trip_advisor,"We stayed at this hotel for four nights over New Years, last week. Hotel is in the perfect location for shopping and restaurants. We were upgraded to a suite upon check in. Staff was exceptionally friendly, and helpful with any questions. Rooms are updated and well decorated, as were the beds very comfortable. Lounge area has several tvs and a large sitting area. Would definitely recommend staying at this hotel.",nan,nan,ta_s1803
trip_advisor,"We got a terrific rate that was only $150 per night (through Hilton's site) which included valet parking. A total steal! The hotel location, amenities, and quality were top notch. The rooms could use an update but not bad enough for us not to stay again! The hotel is connected to the Nordstrom mall, close to restaurants, etc...we would definitely stay again!",nan,nan,ta_s1804
trip_advisor,"We absolutely loved the Conrad. Service is wonderful, the rooms are spacious, the bed is comfortable and you have a pillow menu. The bathroom is huge with a separate walk in shower and deep bathtub. We were on the 15th floor and had a great view of the city. It is one block from Michigan Avenue and connected to a mall. It is the perfect location and you couldn't stay somewhere nicer. Would definitely stay there again.",nan,nan,ta_s1805
trip_advisor,"From check-in the check-out, this hotel met or exceeded all expectations. We had a large room on the 16th floor that was very comfortable for our 4-night stay. The room was refreshed daily by the housekeeping staff. The room itself had a huge bathroom with sunken tub and separate shower stall. Bed was wonderfully comfortable. Staff was very accomodating with all requests and questions etc. We enjoy the fresh green apples and iced citrus water in the lobby each day. The hotel itself is well-located in downtown Chicago, close to subways, shopping, fantastic restaurants. Would stay here again!",nan,nan,ta_s1806
trip_advisor,"Brilliant stay at this stunning hotel, perfectly located to all amneties. Rooms nice and comfy, bathroom was awesome. will definitely stay here again. Free wifi big plusOnly 1 issue I had was with the front staff upon checking, he was not very friendly nor did he explain to me the overall hotel services such as gym, and if i need a coffee maker in my room etc I had to call to request this. Other then that great stay.",nan,nan,ta_s1807
trip_advisor,"I stayed there for 6 nights for leisure. The location is excellent, near all the attractions and landmarks by walking distance, I like walking around in a cool weather. I checked in around 1:30pm but rooms not ready as most of the rooms are connecting? That's ok though as I went out for shopping. Great service from reception and restaurant, especially concierge team. All of them are so helpful and informative and made my stay comfortable!! Two things I would comment though, housekeeping service is a bit slow, I like to make up my room before noon time as I have jet lag, I normally stay in the room around 3 or 4pm and every time the room was not cleaned... The first day I informed reception at 9:30am then when I came back at 1pm the room is still not cleaned... The rest of the days I just gave up... I know it's running full house but I think guest's preference and request should not be ignored.Second thing is that the internet is HORRIBLE!! This is the worst connection I have ever encountered in Hilton and conrad group.. I'm a frequent traveller and internet is very important to me at some point. The first day I used the complimentary internet and it was super slow and disconnected all the time.Then I thought maybe if I pay $12.95 will be better and IT'S NOT! I don't mind paying for the charge but once the service is chargeable I expect the connection is smooth. I got disconnected ALL THE TIME when I was trying to order something online or sending out an email, it's unacceptable!! Other than these two things i have mentioned, everything else is fine. But I may try to stay somewhere else nearby next time.",nan,nan,ta_s1808
trip_advisor,"We planned a short trip up to Chicago and scored an awesome deal at this hotel (from the Conrad website even!). It's located right under/in the Shops at North Bridge, which is right on Michigan Avenue! So close to shopping, awesome restaurants and walkable to the river, Navy Pier and shopping all along the Magnificent Mile. Hotel staff are incredibly accommodating, which I hadn't necessarily expected since we were getting a steal on the room. Keurig coffee makers with Starbucks coffee, free bottled water, free wifi and access to plug iPod or iPad to the flat screen TV for streaming, etc. Only drawbacks - no pool and self-parking is $45/night (with in-out privileges though). Would try to stay here every time I come to Chicago!",nan,nan,ta_s1809
trip_advisor,"The Conrad Chicago, a Hilton family member, has proclaimed its location attached to the downtown Shops of North Bridge with Nordstrom's the anchor, for several years. Conrad Hotels are in second place to Waldorf Astoria in the Hilton hierarchy. Thus, one expects a modicum of luxury from such an esteemed standing. Unfortunately, while the Chicago Conrad is very nice and can often have good prices, time has taken its toll, and for a luxury accommodation, the Conrad lacks panache and style. The main entrance on Rush Street is unimposing with the main lobby on the fifth floor. You then must take a separate elevator to your room. This was often inconvenient because of crowding and slow elevators. The rooms, a nice size, are conservatively styled in what is now a rather plain decor; light wood, pale yellow walls, beige carpeting. The bathrooms are huge, with a lots of thick towels, strong hot water, large tub and separate toilet room. So why the mediocre review? Everything is dated, exuding a kind of morose aura, like a former starlet who has lost her looks and doesn't try anymore. The Conrad needs a good facelift, and soon. Chicago is ""hot"" right now, and new hotels are springing up everywhere. The competition is snapping at the Conrad's heels, and it needs to do something. The TV is old and lacks HD, something expected today. There's no coffee in the room, and while the coffee kiosk in the lobby is perfectly lovely run by a charming young woman, it is a pain to take the elevator down to get your caffeine in the morning. The River North location is perfect, except for the two elevator entrance and exit, and the staff very efficient. Yet, the hotel business is constantly evolving and the Conrad needs to find a ""fountain of youth.""",nan,nan,ta_s1810
trip_advisor,"There are many great hotels in Chicago, and this hotel should be on your list. The hotel itself is gorgeous, with a very nice bar and dining area in the lobby, and what looks like a terrace bar - which wasn't open because it's November in Chicago.The room is very nicely appointed and comfortable. All the things you'd expect in a Hilton with an extra touch to reflect the Conrad brand. Staff is very helpful.Location is great. You're steps away from the Miracle Mile and the Chicago River. If you're headed to Chicago, give the Conrad a look.",nan,nan,ta_s1811
trip_advisor,"I stayed here for 3 nights as I was working at an event in McCormick Place. The hotel is conveniently situated just off Michigan Avenue so it is a great location for shoppers. The bedroom was a good size with a large bathroom. The bed was very comfortable and I slept very well. The only disappointment was the dining and lounge areas, they seemed too basic for what is classed as a ""luxury establishment"" and had very limited choice on the menu. At breakfast time it got very busy so the staff found it difficult to cope with the demand. In the early evenings the bar area got very crowded, there was limited seating and again the staff found it difficult to meet the demand. However, on balance i would recommend this hotel but suggest you dine in one of the great restaurants nearby.",nan,nan,ta_s1813
trip_advisor,"The outstanding features of this hotel are probably its location, so proximal to Magnificent Mile, and also the size of the rooms. The front desk staff was very polite and helpful. The complimentary coffee in the lobby in the morning was hot, good, available... many teas, etc to choose from too. I liked the location of the bar. It was between the entry/lobby and the rooms. While this might sound odd, it lent to a very pleasant, casual experience. We did not dine in the hotel, as we had heard that this was supposed to be less than positive. There were numerous good eating spots within a stone's throw though. One cool spot to try, if it fits your desires, is Billy Goat's Cheese Burger, Cheese Burger, Cheese Burger (made famous by the old SNL skit). It is less than a minute from the hotel. We would stay again at the Conrad, no question.",nan,nan,ta_s1814
trip_advisor,"Conrad stands for luxury hilton, but there is no luxury in this hotel! The room is spacious, but it looks old, no design to it. The toilet got clogged once, and the water would not stop running, so if you woke up to use the bathroom, you'll have to get up again and switch the water off. A sock lost under the bed remained their until checkout. The room (828) was right by the elevator, and i could hear eny ladies heels any time of the day, because the elevator lobby had no carpet. 8 floor is conveniently accessed from the Rush street level. The front desk staff was polite and efficient. The blonde server at breakfast was very nice, all other were not efficient enough, and took 5$ off my bill, well, I'd better pay an extra ten for getting a loose tea, rather than a bag, and for receiving warm soy milk instead of cold, as requested. But can't but mention that the food wuality and taste are exceptional, the chefs are great! Upon arrival nobody has offered to take care of our bags. The hotel provides free water and wifi, which is nice. The gym is good, the a/c works fine. The lobby area is also fine. The Conrad Tokyo was wonderful, this one is not even slightly close. The trump chicago we stayed in previous time was outstanding!",nan,nan,ta_s1815
trip_advisor,"Overall I would give this hotel an average rating. I didn't find anything spectacular to rave about from the time I registered to the time I left. The bed wasn't a good fit for me...too soft, but some of my colleagues said they slept great. The hotel drink prices are expensive. I had a 2 telephone charges for on my bill (as did some of my colleagues) for calls I did not make......in this day of cell phones, does one really need to use a hotel phone? Of course the front desk provided me with a corrected bill. If I were traveling for pleasure, I wouldn't go out of my way to stay at this hotel. It is convenient for shopping.",nan,nan,ta_s1816
trip_advisor,"Spent one night during the week. As gold member was given an upgraded room. The room was fine, bathroom had a large tub and a stand alone shower stall. They also had a small black towel for people to use when removing make-up. The first time we've seen that in a hotel. Public spaces were not impressive. The bar is on the main walkway between the front desk and elevators to the guest rooms so people with suitcases are passing through at all hours. Restaurant for breakfast had good service but poor food. Eggs were merely warm. Coffee was good and hot. Sausages were largely tasteless. The Rush Street entrance is below a walkway insuring darkness no matter the time of day. Not impressive. Then you must take an elevator to the 5th floor to register at the other lobby. Becomes annoying to have to take two elevators every timed you want to enter or leave the building. I guess it is a technique for keeping the homeless out of the hotel.Location is wonderful for shoppers and people in town for a good time. About a mile from most cultural venues.It is a good hotel but not a great hotel and does not stand out from other hotels in its class in the Hilton chains.",nan,nan,ta_s1817
trip_advisor,"We really didn't use all of the hotels amenities,but what we did experience was excellent. We were here for a medical meeting so received convention pricing. Our room did not have much of a view but we also had not requested one. The room was large with extremely comfortable king sized bed( lots of pillows),plenty of lighting, a desk,chair and ottoman, flat screen TV,safe, and a small refrigerator you can have stocked. The bathroom was very nice with a separate toilet room, soaking tub,separate shower and plenty of counter space for cosmetics. Beautifully clean. I will say I have never seen as narrow of a tub outside of Europe. High end bathroom toiletries and plenty of hot water with good water pressure. They also supplied robes and slippers. Just little touches that make you more comfortable. Turn down service must be requested. We did have the concierge make two dinner reservations for us,one at our request and one at her suggestion. Her suggestion was excellent and her manner was very friendly and helpful. The public spaces are modern and lovely. Coffee service is in the lobby every morning and pretty good too ! The location is great for shopping on Michigan Avenue. I would stay here again.",nan,nan,ta_s1818
trip_advisor,"Nice convenient location to shop and visit restaurants. A block from Michigan Avenue on Rush Street. Outdoor rooftop patio is a nice touch for drinks and dining. The hotel is connected directly to shopping including Nordstrom's. We opted for a two room suite which had all the necessities and then some. We had breakfast each morning in the restaurant where the service was quick and food good. The hotel bar had a nice assortment of upper shelf liquors, Hendricks Gin and Brugal Rum to name a few.Service staff is top notch.This is the second time we stayed at the Conrad and have been pleased both times.",nan,nan,ta_s1819
trip_advisor,"Had a very pleasant 6 day stay here recently. Located right in the heart of the city - close to where Michigan Avenue crosses the river, so literally an easy walk to anywhere downtown. Minutes to Michigan Avenue, an easy walk to Navy Pier, loads of restaurants shops and bars within crawling distance. Hotel itself was fine, clean with all the amenities you could want. I had a wheelchair accessible room so the room and bathroom was huge (not sure if all rooms are like this). Bathroom was nice, bed very comfortable, nice tv with 60 channels (must be America!). Friendly and helpful staff. The hotel overall is not quite as polished as Conrad hotels in other parts of the world (particularly Asia) but this is typical of these chain hotels when comparing the USA to restof the world. Still a very pleasant and trouble-free stay.I used the laundry service once and had no problems. The fitness centre is fine with properly working equipment (and open 24hrs). Complimentary wifi which worked well.My only complaints were that someone in a nearby room had a dog (ridiculous) that you could sometimes hear. Also the layout of the 5th floor is silly - the reception and bar area are on the 5th floor and face directly on to some of the guest rooms on the 5th floor, which means you get some noise in those rooms - avoid the rooms close to the elevators on the 5th floor.Overall a good stay, I will stay here again when I next visit Chicago.",nan,nan,ta_s1820
trip_advisor,"You know how it goes, you have a hundred windows open and then availability starts to disappear and you just book the next one. I knew the area I wanted to be in - walking distance to the miracle mile (this looks like it might be a block away, but actually it's on it) and close to everything else. We loved it! Nice sized rooms, comfy beds/sheets, nice bathroom with separate toilet, nice toiletries. Lovely lobby to chill out in, high end breakfast options, service was smooth and helpful everywhere. We got a really good rate that included breakfast, which was a nice surprise (all those windows, I didn't know what I was booking by the end!) I would definitely stay there again. We were a family, I would recommend it for older children, but not necessarily younger/tiny ones. Very good for business and I saw quite a few single business women, who felt comfortable staying there, as well as groups of business travelers and older families.",nan,nan,ta_s1821
trip_advisor,"So, a few things surprising about this hotel are both good and bad. I am writing this review from said hotel room where we are having a meeting for wealthy donors to the Red Cross. The good:*lighted make-up mirror*nice overall look to the room*great lobby*good amenities (bath products, Q-tips, toothbrush, mouthwash)*friendly staffThe bad:* furniture and desktop accessories showing tons of age in wear and tear*bathroom still has dirty floor showing shoe prints that don't match mine*no coffee maker in room (but some fellow mtg goers had it, most didn't)*room service pretty pricey ($30 for oatmeal and a cup of coffee this AM)*TV difficult to figure out how to operate; had to look at the in-room manual (what does that tell you?)*no newspaper despite being Hilton+ member*customizable mini-bar a bad idea as it will not drive revenue if you have to order a $125 bottle of vodka with 4 ""complimentary"" mixers. Just one mini-bottle would have sufficed and more likely to have been consumed* poor service in lobby bar as we had to go up to order after waiting 15 minutes*weird elevator system and conference rooms not well marked - took 10 extra minutes to find meeting room this morning",nan,nan,ta_s1822
trip_advisor,"You're going to have to decide this one on your own. Some good, some bad. I think it depends what type of room you get that would make this go up or down. Pros: I requested a Keurig coffee machine and a refrigerator to be in the room (free). They were there and in perfect order when I arrived. The hotel supplied free bottled water, which was wonderful. The sheets and towels were very clean and soft and sparkling white. The location is good. The room was very large. They put nice crystal in the bathroom - the tray for soap, etc. Very nice, looked first class. The water pressure in the shower was excellent. Breakfast was delicious and included in our package. Free coffee in the mornings was wonderful and much appreciated. Service was excellent all around. Free wi-fi in room was good. The cons: The hotel is configured in a rather confusing manner. I knew it would be odd from the previous Trip advisor reviews but it still was a little strange to me. Took a while to sort of figure out where I was going but it wasn't awful. The room was decorated in a god-awful brown and tan pattern. Maybe reminiscent of the 1970's, I'm not sure, but the feng shuai was awful and the colors and patterns depressing. The arm chair was threadbare, the ottoman worse. Nicked up and marked up from too many years of use. that was the point I thought that I didn't want to stay a whole week in a depressing room and was debating asking them to remove the chair. Or my other option was that I started dialing other local hotels to get prices. Decided to stick it out here in the end, but really that room was ugly as heck. I was sort of hoping for a relaxing soft beautiful room to sleep peacefully and relax in. Also double beds are way too small for two americans to sleep comfortably in. The bathroom stall with the toilet -when the light was right - was not clean You could see something splattered all over the wall. Since this was basically a closet with a toilet, I didn't really want to think about what it could be. The numbers were worn off the TV remote. The night stand had liquid splash stains on it too and I had to clean that up. Lot of dust. Shower head full of calcium deposits - really should have been cleaned. Lobby is also ugly, looked much better on -line. Too stark modern. Didn't give a warm welcoming feeling of comfort that I was looking for. Could have been a little more luxurious than it was. The safe in the room was not bolted to anything, which was kind of stupid. We were on the 7th floor and for many nights we heard non stop sirens and horns blowing from the street below. Apparently there is a hospital nearby and all ambulances seem to go by this hotel. I wouldn't have thought 7 floors up this was possible, but it was. I think a bell staff was blowing a whistle to hail cabs nearby because we heard shrill whistle noises constantly earlier in the day. The bar in the lobby was crowded but not really special. the drinks were incredibly overpriced and the bar snacks ridiculously stale and nasty. Couldn't justify the price of the drinks to get a second one or go another night. So I possibly would not stay here again unless I got a good deal but don't expect a whole lot of luxury. I think they have nicer rooms so maybe you could request that.",nan,nan,ta_s1823
trip_advisor,"I was at the Conrad for a meeting recently and spent three nights there. The hotel is a bit quirky in layout, given the way it's built into ia downtown location, but once you sort out the various elevator issues (which rooms are accessible from which elevator banks, etc...) that's no big deal. The location is fantastic for getting out and seeing some of the city, and hotel itself is modern, well-maintained, and very pleasant.It isn't without some quirks - when I was there they were having trouble w/ their internet/wifi access in the room but by the time I'd checked in they had figured out a work-around that was fine. In my guest room one of the phone lines didn't work and despite me asking daily to have someone look at it I don't think anyone ever tried to fix it. Or, if they tried they failed and never let me know they had been in the room.The hotel food is among the best I've ever had - really terrific food in room service, hotel outlets, and the food served to our large group. For anyone who does meeting planning type work I'd say that the staff is very gracious but not quite as top notch as the property would indicate. (Room turns when the turn-around was tight were BRUTAL, banquet staff was quite loud and disruptive in refreshing coffee/clearing buffets/etc... while meetings were happening, AV staff were a little slow to deal with feedback issues, etc...) So nothing terribly serious, but not quite the level of polish I would have expected.Overall though the Conrad is a great hotel, the rooms are spacious, well-appointed and in great condition. (Note - not all rooms have tubs/showers so if you have any wishes or needs for one or the other be sure to ask when you're checking in or making the reservation.) This was my second time at The Conrad and the quality has been consistent.",nan,nan,ta_s1824

Wow wow we loved it .Thank you Conrad staff job well done,nan,nan,ta_s1825
trip_advisor,"Excellent hotel tucked away on N. Rush street in a great part of the city. The rooms are spacious, upscale and extremely clean. Bar and lobby are on the 5th floor, thus limiting the experience to those in the know.

The Conrad is the starting point for my next stay in the Windy City.",nan,nan,ta_s1826
trip_advisor,"We stayed in Chicago for 3 days (2 nights) to celebrate my daughter's 16th birthday. I'm a Hilton Honors member and used 2 free-stay certificates for our two nights at the Conrad - so it was completely a reward stay - booked for a standard 2-double bed room.When we arrived, we were told that we had been upgraded for free to a Terrace Suite. We were hesitant at first because the two kids weren't thrilled when they heard ""pull-out"" and ""rollaway"" as the bed options after the single King bed i the suite. But, we went with it. What an awesome decision that turned out to be. The Terrace Suite (Room 1409) was Huge, and beautiful (and clean). The terrace had a wonderful view of the city, running all the way down to the lake, and was a nice place to sit and have a drink and listen to the city sounds.The amenities in the suite were top notch, from bedding to TV/music, to bath. And everywhere were windows with views of the city. Also, unlike most places we've stayed with a rollaway and a pullout - these were extremely nice and comfortable - not the thin flimsy types we've come to expect. The kids were quite happy with the bedding. In addition to the room, the staff delivered chocolates and a birthday cupcake to the room for my daughter, along with a personal note from the manager welcoming her. It was a nice touch and made her feel special.We also received vouchers for breakfast. I've heard many people complain about the HHonors breakfasts - the vouchers were all worth a free special breakfast or $19 towards another meal - which covered the American: Eggs, meat, potatoes, pastry/toast, coffee and juice. It was a lot of food, and was quite good. Not sure what those complaints were about - we were very pleased. Valet parking is expensive ($65/nt) but it is convenient. And the location of the hotel is great. We walked to the Pier, and to shopping and dining. Only needed a cab for a few excursions.All in all, the stay at the Conrad was perfect for us, and the staff was friendly. And we are extremely grateful to them for the wonderful upgrade and service they provided. It turned a good trip into a great trip.",nan,nan,ta_s1827
trip_advisor,"We spent five nights at the Conrad and were so pleased. Rooms are very clean and nicely finished. Beds are so comfortable as well. The whole property is beautifully finished and concierge is extremely helpful. Hallways are unnecessarily cold, however, and the restaurant is a poor choice for breakfast. Prices are so high ($52 for breakfast for two) and quantity is insufficient. A better idea is to go over to the restaurant at Nordstrom's but it does not open until the store opens at 10:00. Location is ideal.",nan,nan,ta_s1828
trip_advisor,"We were completely satisfied with our stay at the Conrad. It is close to all of downtown Chicago's main attractions either by walking or in a cab. This was part business & part pleasure and was great for both. The bar tender and wait staff were exceptional, offering many helpful suggestions and being entertaining at the same time. With so many great restaurants in this town we chose not to eat at the hotel (not even breakfast) so can not comment on the food or service there. I felt for the location and the facility it was an excellent value for the money. Would definitely go back.",nan,nan,ta_s1830
trip_advisor,"I had to attend a meeting and decided to take the family for a weekend get-a-way. We stayed at the Conrad and what a treat it was. Our King Suite on the 17th floor overlooking Michigan Ave. It was updated, clean and offered a great view. The kids never complained about sleeping on a pull-out sofa bed, so it must have been comfortable. The king mattress was superb as well.From reservations to checkout the staff was incredibly friendly and helpful. Add in the great location and this is a must stay hotel.",nan,nan,ta_s1831
trip_advisor,"Great hotel. From the moment we arrived, the staff was incredible; very friendly and courteous. My room was on the 12th floor and was very quite and warm. The gym area is pretty decent; couple of cardio machines and weight. It did not have a view though so it felt a little clustered. The restaurant and bar area feels very welcoming. Great service and bartenders. The food is really good as well but if you want other options you can go to the adjecent mall where you can find a food court.Will definitely go back!",nan,nan,ta_s1832
trip_advisor,"The Conrad Chicago is a great location for easy access to shopping, attractions, museums, and public transportation. The service level was great from the front desk to housekeeping to the doormen. The rooms are nice with large updated bathrooms and comfortable furnishings. The restaurant however, was loud and ran fairly slow. For the price of the meal, you are better off checking out one of the many local restaurants.",nan,nan,ta_s1833
trip_advisor,"As others have shared, The Conrad has a great location in the middle of the Magnificent Mile. Service was very professional from the bellman through the front desk staff. I had a King executive room which was a corner room. It provided an excellent amount of space with one of the larger bathrooms that I have seen in my travels. This stay at The Conrad helped solidify it as my go to hotel when returning to Chicago.",nan,nan,ta_s1834
trip_advisor,"Spent a weekend here for work and a little fun. The Conrad was as good as last time- this is a real 4 star hotel: great, friendly staff with a sense of humor and will bend over backwards for you. Ate at the bar one night and bartender/wait staff were awesome and fun to chat with. Dinner food was good quality. Had breakfast one morning and it was good but not great: expensive and given that this is Illinois and not, say, New York City, breakfast seemed a little overpriced. The real draw at this place is the location and rooms. The Conrad is a block and a half from Michigan Avenue and lots of stuff going on there. The rooms are lovely, tasteful, and have extra touches such as way comfortable beds, huge bathrooms with soaker bath tubs, robes, slippers, and high end toiletries. Plus the staff gave me the room I requested. High floor with a city view was just right. I will keep coming back for these amenities.",nan,nan,ta_s1838
trip_advisor,"I received extremely great service from all the staff at the Conrad, the food for our conference was awesome and the amenities the hotel had were great, to include direct access to the mall. The bed was super comfy, the tv and surround was ultra neat and OMG the toiletries were awesome (i know weird thing to talk about but most hotel soap and shampoo sucks). The hotel is in a great location, I had such a great stay here and plan to go back.",nan,nan,ta_s1839
trip_advisor,"I love staying at the Conrad whenever I visit Chicago! The location is perfect, the staff is always wonderful, and the rooms are bright and comfortable.We were in town for a quick foodie weekend. The Conrad is an almost literal hop, skip and jump from The Purple Pig--perfect on a frigid Sunday afternoon. After learning our group of 6 would have an hour wait at the Pig, we went back to the hotel bar and had a super comfortable wait in the lounge and sipped on an adult beverage until our table was ready. Perfect!The Conrad app is a great tool! Whenever we left the room in the morning we requested housekeeping services. We did the same in the evening with the turndown services. Service was always very prompt--even if we ended up returning to our room earlier than expected. Our room was always spotless and waiting for our return. The housekeeping staff was wonderful!Check-in was smooth. And the free breakfast (as a Hilton rewards member) was a nice bonus! The Valet staff was always helpful and prompt in getting our car or in helping us stumble out of a cab after a 10 course tasting menu. The rooms are comfortable and bright. They are a nice size for a major downtown city! And the bathroom is HUGE!The Conrad will always be our favorite place to stay when visiting.",nan,nan,ta_s1840
trip_advisor,"This beautiful property never disappoints. From the moment one arrives at the front entry, the service is polished, personal, and professional. We requested an upgraded room as my husband is an Honors Diamond member. They gave us a lovely suite with a spacious bathroom. The view wasn't as nice as on other stays but that isn't what we came for! The bedding is wonderfully soft and luxurious, towels fluffy, absorbent, and large, and the other amenities in the room, sound system, coffee maker, lots of plugs, warm robes, etc. were great.We had only two complaints on this stay. One had to do with the restaurant during breakfast each morning. Service was slow but the food was delicious. The other complaint was that the property's bar is being renovated. As a result, the chemical smell from one of the adhesives or materials they were using permeated throughout the hallways in the hotel.We love the location of this hotel, particularly in the cold winter months.",nan,nan,ta_s1841
trip_advisor,"I booked the Executive Suite for my husband's birthday dinner. Upon reserving the room I explained that we would like a 10 person dinner table and place settings. The reason why I gave this hotel one star was because the hotel itself was very nice and they accomodated all my requests. We were very pleased with the room and setup. Our guests arrived at about 9pm. By 9:30 we had a hotel manager and another person at our door complaining that the noise level was too loud. Then by 10pm again they were at our door. Then by 11pm they were there again stating that all our guests needed to leave. Within the 1 1/2 we had about 3 phone calls. I even called to ask what needed to be done as we weren't being extremely loud or anything out of the ordinary. I have been to many hotels in the past. We were all adults and hosting a dinner party. This was not a teenagers house party by any means. 10 people having dinner does have some level of noise associated with it. We were enjoying dinner and each other's company. I had to rush my guests through dinner and cake. Then had to abrubtly call the night early due to this. I feel disappointed as I would have recommended this place. However I paid for a suite to host a dinner party just how the other guests paid for their rooms as well. I think it's a little inconsiderate that we were treated this way. We were just having a nice dinner and there is some noise associated with that. I think their expectations were unrealistic. Why have a room that holds that many people, prep for that many people, then act that way. We were not any louder than if you were at a restaurant having a nice dinner with 10 or so friends. I would not recommend this hotel to anyone younger than 65. It was very clear that the atmosphere and guests were of a much older crowd. I think it's inappropriate to expect that other guests sit and whisper to each other to keep the noise level down. Again I've hosted other dinners at many other Chicago hotels with no problems at all. I would recommend others use those hotels and not the Conrad. If you are looking for an uneventful and very very quiet evening the Conrad is for you.",nan,nan,ta_s1842
trip_advisor,"I stayed at the Conrad for a recent convention and had a good overall experience. The rooms are a decent size, clean, and comfortable. The bed and pillows were excellent. The bathroom was a good size and had a separate water closet. The lighting in front of the mirror was a little tricky to shave in, so I would imagine that some ladies would have similar complaints about doing make-up. The shower temperature was a little finicky, but not a big issue. The lobby renovations were just finishing the day of my departure and the new bar looks very nice. While I got a group rate deal for my conference, I have stayed at the Conrad before and found the room rates to be very competitive. For the location, it is usually hard to find a better deal. The property may not have a historic feel or be particularly charming, but for a long weekend in Chicago, the price and location are very good.",nan,nan,ta_s1843
trip_advisor,"When visiting Chicago the Fairmont is a great location Downtown which means you are well positioned to visit various attractions that include; The Bean, aquarium, Soldier Field, architecture boat tour (which was superb and I thought it was going to be dry) etc. We stayed 5 nights and paid the extra for the Gold Floor, well worth it. The team on the floor can't do enough to ensure your complete stay in Chicago is a success. Pay the extra and stay on the Gold Floor. Unfortunately from the wider hotel facilities we only used the gym, everything else was catered in the Gold Lounge so why try anything else when we already had great service there ? The floor team is lead well by their manager, Murtaza, a great guy and someone who helped us with all manner of requests and questions, even obtaining Fairmont tea! The floor lounge is a big busy at times with business people using this as a base but they quickly move on and when on holiday it's always good to get a bit of a long lie.",nan,nan,ta_s1845
trip_advisor,"I stayed for four nights at the Fairmont Millennium Park. I was there for a conference and the hotel is very well located to the other hotels and events that I needed to attend. The room and the view I had were beautiful and very well appointed. Loved looking out to Millennium Park and Lake Michigan. The other huge high spot in my stay was the Gold Level lounge. There was coffee, tea, water, juice, and soda all day and sweet snacks at 2pm and 7pm. At 5pm there were appetizers and two nights they were outstanding, and greatly offset my dinner. The best, however, was the breakfast, which is a full buffet meal with eggs, potatoes, bacon, pastries, oatmeal & cold cereal, yogurt parfaits, fresh fruit, and bagels with all the fixings. Loved the espresso machine. Loved the view and the place to meet up with colleagues. Ate twice at the hotel restaurant (Ario?) and it was just OK. Wifi free only for President's Club, but you can join while there.",nan,nan,ta_s1846
trip_advisor,"The Fairmont millennium park in Chicago is top of the line luxury. The rooms are modern and large. The views from he higher lever rooms have the most breathtaking views of the lake, which has a Caribbean like real color. The lobby of the hotel has a great wine bar which gets a good crowd in the evenings. The Fairmont staff is kind and eager to please, don't be afraid to ask for an upgraded room. If they have the availability they will certainly upgrade you.",nan,nan,ta_s1847
trip_advisor,"We were here for a two night stay attending a conference. Rooms are very nice with great bathrooms including tiled shower and separate bathtub. However, when we arrived, there was a long brown hair on top of the toilet seat lid and one in the sink. Not the kind of cleanliness you would expect from an upscale hotel. Additionally, the sliding pocket door for closing off the lavatory area did not work very well. If you get a room with two double beds, be assured those are DOUBLE beds and NOT QUEEN size beds. Comfortable, but smaller than expected. There is a also no real drawer space available in any of the furniture for storing clothing. There is a good size closet with a safe and there is another vanity area with a large mirror. Room service is very efficient, but also very expensive. Valet parking is $70 per night. Wifi is extra charge at like $19 day and there is nothing close to a complimentary breakfast. ALL of the staff were VERY friendly and efficient from the bellman to room service to the front desk. We found out too late that there are numerous food outlets in the lower level of the neighboring AON Building and that there is an underground walk way to many other locations. There's also a CVS Drugstore across the street from the hotel. If you bring a pet, there is a dog park across from the hotel, but you must navigate a substantive number of outdoor stairs to reach it.",nan,nan,ta_s1848
trip_advisor,"The American Education Research Association had it's annual conference in Chicago this past week and the Fairmount was one of the selections. The location was perfect for getting to the other conference hotels and the morning long walk that included city and lake views was very pleasant. I splurged and stayed on the Gold Floor with lounge and it was worth it. Great city views from the room and the breakfast etc in the lounge, including a very nice Italian wine, was great. Had a long window of time to work, which I did in the lounge rather than my room and it was very nice.",nan,nan,ta_s1849
trip_advisor,I had two gripes. The first was a dirty bed throw. They fixed that immediately and were apologetic. The second was that the rooms look a bit tired. This hotel just didn't live up to my experience staying at the Fairmonts on the west coast.The best part about any Fairmont is the people. They do hire some of the best you can find and so I don't blame them as much as I blame the actual property owners. The restaurant staff was especially good and the food was always terrific. I was there for a little over a week and I was pleased with the service.,nan,nan,ta_s1852
trip_advisor,"From the moment that we stepped out of our car and were met by the valet, I knew that this was going to be a great experience. The valet was pleasant and efficient. The check in process was welcoming and without problem. Our room on the 19th floor(1916) was spacious with two double beds. There were three windows and a great view of the street and buildings below. The beds were super comfy and the room was updated with modern decor. My favorite thing about the room, besides the view were the bathrobes provided with the linens in the bathroom. The conceirge was helpful and very patient with our questions. We were so close to the Museum of Art and shopping on the Miracle Mile. We enjoyed being welcomed back by the valets at the front door.",nan,nan,ta_s1853
trip_advisor,"We have stayed at this hotel the last three times visiting Chicago and yet have had a single complaint. My husband and I do not take exceptional customer service for granted anymore these days and the folks at this hotel deliver it (this is coming from someone who has worked in the restaurant service industry for 25 years). As a side note, the doormen are extremely friendly and helpful. Everything they suggested was a hit with us and certainly added to all the fun we had.",nan,nan,ta_s1854
trip_advisor,"Chicago has so many new luxury hotels, you would think it would be hard for the ""oldies"" to keep up. Having stayed recently at both the Fairmont Millennium Park and the Ritz Carlton, I honestly believe that what you may sacrifice in terms of modern amenities, you make up for in the overall quality of the experience. The Fairmont's concierge went out of her way to help us find a needle in a haystack, and came through with flying colors. Here, the staff really makes the difference. If there's something you want or need (even if it's just an extra ice bucket), you will get it. Quickly.If high ceilings and ultra-modern lobbies aren't crucial to you, the 5-star Chicago hotel experience is available at what some might consider ""bargain"" rates. Take it!",nan,nan,ta_s1855
trip_advisor,"Loved the view of our second room and loved that we could walk to and from the train stations, navy pier, and millennium park. Everything is so close the problem was that our first room had blood smeared on the walls of the bathroom. Bad first impression at the least. Staff was happy to change our room but still felt dirty after seeing the bathroom of the first. Poor water pressure as well and towels feel like sandpaper.",nan,nan,ta_s1856
trip_advisor,"We spent four nights here in early December to experience Chicago at Christmas. This hotel was perfectly located for downtown Chicago, with everything within easy walking distance, such as Michigan Avenue aka The Magnificent Mile with it's designer shopping and plentiful restautants, Navy Pier and Millenium Park. The area around the hotel is built on three levels with the bulk of the city traffic travelling below and out of sight. It initially appears when you enter the hotel forecourt that you are at ground level until you realise that this part of the city is on stilts to facilliate the city traffic. It is designed very well ,thus this part of Columbus Drive is relatively traffic free, clean, safe and pleasant to walk on. There is also a Pharmacy and convienience store which opens late directly across the road which we found handy. The hotel is essentialy a tower block ( a tall one so it it can offer good views) with a lovely lobby area and central bar feature where you can sit and have coffee. It has a nice restaurant called Aria and a decent bar which offers good bar food such as Pizza, burgers etc and was large and lively enough to spend an evening. It had a decent selection of beers and whiskies and cocktails. There is a spa on the lower floors that appeared quite popular although we did not try it. The majority of custom and guests when we were there appeared to be business people and the hotel is certainly geared up for conventions, but this did not detract from the hotel having a comfortable holiday feel, it certainly accommodated families and indeed it made for some lively festive atmosphere in the evenings within the bar area. We were in a lovely suite on the 33rd floor with an excellent view of Lake Michigan, that also took in Navy Pier, the Chicago River and large parts of Millenium Park. This had excellent facillities such as Flatscreen TV, Coffee, Tea and walk in shower and bath. Importantly it had a very large and comfortable bed. There are plenty of great places to eat locally with a excellent Italian Restaurant called Fellini's directly across the road and a bar/ Restaurant around the corner on Wacker Drive called Houlihans that currently does an all you can eat Buffet Breakfast untill 11.30 for $9.99. Eat there and that will fill you up for the day's sightseeing. This place faces the Chicago river and directly across the bridge from it on Michigan Avenue is a bus stop/kiosk area where you can buy tickets for double decker and open top tour buses from which you can hop on and hop off as you explore Chicago. This is all approximately five minures walk from the hotel. All the Fairmont staff were extremly polite and professional and made us feel welcome although the place was very busy with business people so was not overly personal. This was not a problem however, this hotel is clean, modern, comfortable reasonably priced and in a safe location with very easy access by foot to what downtown Chicago has to offer. This is the perfect hotel for a city break in Chicago.",nan,nan,ta_s1857
trip_advisor,"We were attending a wedding in Chicago and this was the hotel suggested by the bride. Getting the wedding rate involved several calls which did not bode well, however we really liked the hotel once we were there. We could walk to lots of great shops and restaurants, and when it was raining they gave us umbrellas to use. There was a serious back up when we were waiting for taxis, but I guess that's not unusual.",nan,nan,ta_s1858
trip_advisor,"We stayed here for three nights through New Year's Eve. The hotel used to be pretty swanky and considered top notch. I think it's fallen. There's nothing elegant about it anymore. The spa was very nice, though.. The lobby bar - the Wine Bar - was open ONE time over the course of 3 nights. That was New Year's Eve - and only until 10PM. What? Why have a bar and not open it up? There's ONE restaurant - an Asian fusion place which was also always empty. I travel constantly - and very rarely do I have to pay a Wi-Fi fee anymore. Fairmont is hanging on to the past with this lack of amenity as well. I just think with all the hotel options in Chicago, the Fairmont needs to ramp it up.",nan,nan,ta_s1859
trip_advisor,I spent a week working in Chicago in November and had the privilege of experiencing the delights of the Fairmont Hotel. Centrally located to where I was working it is also a short stroll to Michigan Avenue and Millenium Park with all they have to offer.The decor and service at the hotel is excellent and made me feel like a home away from home. I also utilised the club services where I was able to conduct some tough negotiations over a coffee in excellent surroundings. A fixture whenever I return to Chicago.,nan,nan,ta_s1860
trip_advisor,I spent three weeks in this hotel when on a business trip in March 2013 (yes I'm writing this post pretty late after the fact) and I was blown away by the level of attention to detail. The staff remembered our names and small quirks about each of us within the first few days making it a truly personalised experience. There are delicious on site restaurants (some of the best sushi EVER!) and it is a very quick walk to the Golden Mile if you want to get in some shopping or head off to a nice restaurant.I signed up to the Fairmont member's club and hope to visit their hotels across the globe because this one was such a wonderful experience.,nan,nan,ta_s1861
trip_advisor,"We decided to take the kids along on a long weekend to Chicago to celebrate our anniversary. I'm a frequent guest at The Fairmont Olympic in Seatte (which is a beautiful property) so we chose The Fairmont Millennium as our home base for the trip. When we arrived we were offered the Gold Upgrade to one of their 37th floor suites (the top) and chose The Presidential Suite (We were told Presedent Obama has stayed there). I felt the cost of the upgrade was reasonable considering this was a very special occasion plus it included access to the 15th floor President's Club Gold lounge (serving snacks, horderves and delicious desserts). When we opened the door to the suite we were completely speechless! An absolutely elegant 1,800 square foot expanse with breathtaking views of Chicago and Lake Michigan! (And a baby-grand piano which my daughter used to entertain us with some of her favorite Christmas songs). It was magical! And the service and attention we received from The Fairmont professionals was impeccable! They turned our anniversary into a truly magical weekend with memories that will last a lifetime!",nan,nan,ta_s1862
trip_advisor,"I couldn't be with my family in Chicago this year because...life happens. I stayed at the Fairmont Millennium Park and have no complaints. The exceptional staff has gone above and beyond to meet my needs and make us comfortable. Aside from 'Mama's house' this has been the best place to spend Christmas in Chicago. The atmosphere is friendly, yet professional. The property is beautiful and the views breathtaking. I even received a Christmas stocking personalized with my name! These people are truly amazing.",nan,nan,ta_s1863
trip_advisor,Chicago was the last leg of our long holiday so it was so relieving to stay at such a nice hotel especially since we booked it as a mystery deal on expedia.Hotel is stunning. We checked in and went up to our room to realise we were given 2 double beds instead of a queen or king so we went to the front desk and they were more than happy to help and upgraded us to a massive lake view room with a king bed!Good location. Super helpful staff. Great facilities (fitness centre was good!)Only negative was that weirdly enough they don't provide free in-room wifi and if you do choose to pay its pretty overpriced. However they do have free wifi in the lobby.Definitely would stay again but unfortunately wasn't impressed with Chicago as a city so don't see us coming back anytime soon,nan,nan,ta_s1864
trip_advisor,"This hotel is in a great location, great views, and a good hotel overall. Wewanted a great room for a holiday getaway with friends, and the Fairmont was the only one in the area that had a suite with adjoining bedroom, perfect to hang out in, but still plenty of privacy. Perfect location to do all the ""downtown things"" you want. A few small issues that kept it from being up to par with the excellence I would expect from a Fairmont, but nothing that made it terrible. We will definitely stay here again.",nan,nan,ta_s1865
trip_advisor,"From the moment I checked in and Morgan at the front desk greeted me with a smile and made sure I was happy and had everything I needed through the time I checked out of my exquisite room, everything at this hotel exceeded my expectations. I didn't book the Presidential Suite but Morgan made me feel like I was the most important guest in the hotel and that is a great feeling which can just get your stay off on the right foot. When the staff continues to exceed your expectations that has a way of keeping you happy the entire time. I have visited Chicago about a dozen times and this was my first time at the Fairmont. I can't wait to return.",nan,nan,ta_s1866
trip_advisor,"Our weekend in Chicago was enhanced with a stay at the Fairmont Millennium Park. The price was right for a wonderful room. The stay got off to an outstanding beginning as we were greeted by Morgan at check in. She was bright and energetic and her welcomed us back to the city and Fairmont as we have stayed at the hotel in the past but due to family situations hadn't been downtown for several years. Morgan gave my wife and I a feeling that this was going to be a special time. She reminded us of things that would be interesting to do and we had an excellent chat as she efficiently and quickly checked us in. In fact, we found all hotel personal to be exceedingly friendly and helpful. We were very pleased and will be making a return visit to the Fairmont soon.Mark M",nan,nan,ta_s1867
trip_advisor,"We stayed at the Fairmont over the weekend...our second stay at this hotel. We visit Chicago often and have used at least 15 different hotels over the years -- our decision is usually based on who has the best price for a four-star hotel and in this case the price was exceptional. (The hotel is also close to the Art Institute and our son's neighborhood.) No complaints about the front desk reception, the quality of the restaurant breakfast, or the free wi-fi for President's Club members.But as several other reviews have noted, this hotel is tired and lacking in the kind of detail that you expect from this brand. The $60 million renovation is visible in the lobby, but not in the rooms. More attention to detail would mean that the bedside lights would have been dusted, that there was more than one washcloth or bar of soap in the bathroom (which features separate shower and tub), that there were two robes for guests' use instead of just one, that there was a complimentary bottle of water (instead of a $10 bottle of Evian), and so forth. Stay at one of the many comparable options in Chicago and you'll see where the Fairmont is lacking. p.s. if President's Club members can request a pillow preference ahead of time (in our case, foam instead of down), would it kill the Fairmont Chicago to provide this option?",nan,nan,ta_s1868
trip_advisor,"This hotel is well appointed. The entrance hall is impressive with plenty of seating, and free WiFi in the lobby. I wish hotels would provide it without charge in. rooms, most do now but this does not. However, we were on the 10 floor, room 1016, beautiful spacious room. Two queen beds, a large settee, desk and chair TV etc. spacious bathroom. view not bad. BUT there was a bottle of water invitingly placed on a table with a note attached saying if we used this bottle a charge of 10 dollars would be added to the bill. I think this is totally out of order. It seems like They are trying to screw you for every penny. This hotel is not cheap and I do not like this practice. Location is near the park as the address confirms. The river walk is not far away and is very inviting in hot weather.",nan,nan,ta_s1870
trip_advisor,"I ended up having to stay at the Fairmont because I waited until the last second to book rooms for the One Direction concert that I was taking my daughters to Chicago for. It was much more expensive than I had hoped but after my stay I have been introduced into the world of luxury and I do not think I could stay in a regular old hotel ever again. We arrived much earlier than expected and they had no problem with setting us up with a room way before check in time. The room was beautiful and so updated and modern, with all the amenities you could need. The vanity area really impressed my girls, and the bathroom was so spacious and clean. I was so irritated that I would have to run and buy a phone charger, and then saw that there was a plethora of chargers to choose from right there in my room. Any request to the service desk was met with prompt, efficient and friendly service. Walking out the door to have the doorman blow a whistle for your cab to pull up and take you to your destination, wonderful. Some might be used to this, but I was not and I just loved it. The only thing that I would have appreciated was an additiion to the hotel handbook displaying the prices for items that are in the room. After hearing thousands of screaming girls for a long period of time, I could have downed every mini bottle in that fridge- if I had known what the damage would be on check out. Otherwise, fantastic.",nan,nan,ta_s1871
trip_advisor,"Multiple problems with lost reservations, poor check in , not the room I asked for, forced to move rooms into another room type not requested. Horrible attitude at front desk. The only saving grace is if you complain long enough you will run into a manger who will instantly take care of a problem that you have wasted 30 to 50 minutes on. My advice stay at the Palmer House or the Drake or any competenthotel. This is over priced and under performing.",nan,nan,ta_s1872
trip_advisor,"My husband and I traveled to Chicago for a conference. We were very pleased with the hotel Location was fantastic. ...a great way to tour the city was using the hop-on/ hop off bus. We did not eat breakfast at the hotel. We found a great little place down the street called Wildberrys and went there twice. The hotel is a great central location for walking around and exploring the beautiful city. Also, directly across the street is a drugstore and liquor store which was really handy. We would stay again.",nan,nan,ta_s1873
trip_advisor,"I stayed almost a week for a meeting at McCormick place (a big convention center to the south) and I must say that Fairmont is the downtown near almost all bus/train services. Room was great, very clean and tidy, restaurant is small one as it is well located you can try any other one near. Gym was small but Ok to quick runnings and unfortunately I wasn't able to use was the pool.",nan,nan,ta_s1874
trip_advisor,"we stayed at this hotel last weekend Sept 20. Location is great albeit a bit noisy from the adjacent fire station. Bell staff were great. The hotel felt like they were catering to business people and hence is probably not a first choice for families/couples on R&R. Rooms were spacious.The hotel was, in some parts, down on its heels. It was clear to me from their standoffish attitude, that the front desk weren't interested in travellers who are not paying ""full freight "" because they happened to book thru a travel agent. All in all acceptable but i must say they didnt dazzle us.",nan,nan,ta_s1875
trip_advisor,"My wife and I recently had the pleasure of visiting the great city of Chicago. The staff at the Fairmont was wonderful. Morgan helped beyond expections, making adjustments for the correct (better) room accommodations (Morgan, you really weren't ""mean"", I was joking!). In the Gold lounge, which I highly recommend as a place to start and end your day, Marlene is a star! She followed up on our accommodations to make sure we were happy and was a pleasure to see each day. The room was great, the restaurants were exceptional and our overall experience was 1st class+.Our stay at the Fairmont could not have been better! I highly recommend the Fairmont and make sure you are on the Gold lounge level. It's worth the little extra!! The Parents",nan,nan,ta_s1876
trip_advisor,"My daughter and I shared a mother/daughter long weekend at Fairmont enjoying the unprecedented service and attention we received as guests in Fairmont Gold room and the 15th floor Gold Lounge. Great&insightful recommendations, prompt bookings, the ease of it all etc. Full European style breakfast, a sushi making demonstration and even little impromptu entertainment by a staff Tenor. Thanks for everything Murtaza and Henry! We will be back.",nan,nan,ta_s1878
trip_advisor,"My wife and I stayed at the hotel on the 18th and it was a great hotel. The view from our room of Millennium Park and Columbus Avenue was outstanding we were on the 9th floor, the room was large and the bed and pillows outstanding. This was the first leg of our American adventure and we could not have chosen a better located hotel. It was our Anniversary and we were given a plate of fresh strawberries and raspberries, which unfortunately I could not eat but my wife enjoyed them.However, no free Wi fi and hotel food over priced. Obviously it aimed towards business trips. Perhaps a shoe horn, in each room and may be two cups for the coffee would have been handy.",nan,nan,ta_s1879
trip_advisor,"Just spent 4 nights here with my wife and received exceptional service in a high quality well managed hotelWe booked a Fairmont Gold room which included access to the 15th floor Gold Lounge.The service was amongst the best I have received anywhere.Nothing was too much trouble.The hosts made reservation bookings for us.Each day we enjoyed breakfast and refreshments with a great view of Chicago.On any trip to Chicago in the future, this is where we will stay.",nan,nan,ta_s1880
trip_advisor,"Was here for a professional meeting. The meeting space itself was way too cold but otherwise adequate. Catering was reasonable. I was disappointed by the overall hotel experience and attention to detail. I arrived late night and checkin was rapid and pleasant. But when I got to my room, my key did not work. I called from the elevator lobby to have security come up to let me in and bring a new key. I got more attitude than assistance from person they sent, sort of blaming me for not being able to get their key card to work, ....and no new key (so I had to go to the desk the next morning to get one). The next morning I discovered the coffee maker had no carafe and no basket for the coffee grounds, so brewing a cup in the room was impossible. I had joined the President's Club specifically to get free internet, which was very slow speed but adequate for basic emails. The room was actually nice with good workspace and a comfortable bed. A small group of us attempted to have lunch at the Aria restaurant in the lobby but, despite multiple empty tables, were re-directed to the bar (which we specifically had chosen not to go to since we were not in the mood for ""bar food"" or sushi). None of the very few tables were available so we had to sit at the bar, which made conversation difficult. Fortunately, the waiter did go get us a lunch menu from the main restaurant. So it you are looking for just a room to ay your head at night, this place is fine. But if you are looking for a luxurious or even high end hotel experience, might look elsewhere. I will not return.",nan,nan,ta_s1881
trip_advisor,"I must start this review by stating I am not sure how I got a gold room assigned.I booked on a 3rd party website and was not told it was going to include a free breakfast or any other perks so was quite pleased when I checked in to be informed of that.Was a last minute booking, as we missed a connection flight and were stuck in Chicago as a result.Had a very large room for a city hotel and even had a decent city view.The room was on the 14th floor but included was access to the 15th floor lounge for free breakfast and the other Gold perks.Bed was very comfyUsed the free wifi in our room which is one of the Gold perks.Another one was complementary rental of their BWM bicycles.When I woke up, I went up to the 15th floor lounge, the staff their was fantastic and I was able to reserve a bike for 2 hours.Set out around town and was able to easily cruise downtown, did have to walk the bike through the nearby parks: Millennium Park is steps away, Grant park not far and Navy Pier also close by.Was great to map out a walking itinerary for the day.The bike ride was great, after showering we went to the 15th floor Lounge for breakfast, what a spread! Comfy seats, all you could want to eat with top quality, fresh ingredients and items.Really nice espresso machine coffee maker, we even had a view of the Grant Park fountain from our table. Very quiet and peaceful as well.Definitely the best breakfast we had on this vacation and possibly the best breakfast we have had or at least in quite sometime. Checkout was nice and easy and staff was extremely friendly at all times.",nan,nan,ta_s1882
trip_advisor,"The staff at this hotel made me feel special as soon as I walked in the door. The room was spacious and clean. The bed was comfortable and the pillows were soft. The location here is pretty sweet, too. Restaurants and great shopping are all within walking distance. There's a CVS right across the street and a small grocery store right around the corner. The in room dining options include healthy choices. I don't have a single complaint about this hotel. I would definitely come back, and I would recommend it to others as well!",nan,nan,ta_s1883
trip_advisor,"In the loop, about a mile south of the Magnificent Mile, across the street from Millennium Park, it's in a good location just a bit out of downtown. It's clean and in very good shape, with an exercise room - but no pool - and a spa. We were there for a wedding. The banquet room was impressive. There were over 400 for dinner, all of whom fit comfortably, with one of the largest dance floors I've seen. The banquet food was quite good - especially the hors d'oeuvrs. All of the staff were friendly, accommodating and efficient. Linens and towels were nice, but 4 star, not 5 star. Our rooms were large - especially the suite. The price was reasonable (we had a group rate.) Not sexy or exciting, but very nice.",nan,nan,ta_s1884
trip_advisor,"From the time we entered the spacious lobby until we left 6 days later, we enjoyed a wonderful hotel experience. Everything was done in a professional manner and every person we encountered was smiling and pleasant. Check in was a breeze. The room on the 29th floor was spacious, comfortable and well provisioned. As a member of their President's Club, free WiFi was a perk.The hotel's location was perfect for our needs and a 3 minute walk to our son's apartment around the corner. It's central location was convenient to everything we needed or needed to do. I would have no hesitation in recommending this fine hotel, and it is certainly on my list for a return visit.",nan,nan,ta_s1885
trip_advisor,"Location of hotel is great ( in walking distance to many attractions) and the $300 price we got through booking.com seemed fair for the quality of the room and location. And being in dowtown Chicago, I was not overly surprised by the seemingly steep price to overnight valet park your car - $64 per night. However, our initial very positive experience to the hotel was tainted by the very negative experience we had with the valet parking at time of our departion. It took them 1 hour to get our car out of valet parking from the time we requested it to the time we actually got our car. A series of unfortuante events including the original request never being entered, to them bringing the car to the wrong area showed poor management and possibly understaffing. Another woman waiting with us had been waiting 90 minutes before they found her vehicle.",nan,nan,ta_s1886
trip_advisor,"I had an opportunity to stay at this hotel last month for business. I enjoyed my stay. The check in was fast, the rooms very nice and spacious and my room had a wonderful view. More importantly, for folks from out of town (me), getting out of the hotel in a rental car was easy and put you on a street that was not very congested. This allowed your GPS to capture a satellite and get you to your destination. Valet parking (only parking available) was a steep $60 daily. Ouch.The facilities were nice and easy to get around. I did order room service and the food was absolutely outstanding and priced about right for this type of hotel.I flew into O'Hare airport and then took a rental to the hotel. I had my Garmin GPS unit directing me and it soon got me going in circles in downtown. Perhaps the tall buildings were messing with the satellite connection. But, I got my phone out, used Google maps and it took me straight to the hotel - 1.5mile away in a different location entirely !!",nan,nan,ta_s1887
trip_advisor,"You're paying for top four star hotel but you're getting an average three star hotel.We stayed in this hotel for five days and everyday you get more disappointed by hotels staff.We pay for 2 Gold Rooms and none of the services they've described is available or partially available. For example they offer you a BMW bikes but when you want to use them they're not available and a very rude hotel staff tells you the entire hotel has only three bikes!!!!!??? Breakfast is a Motel style buffet. They shouldn't offer them at all to save the Fairmont's Name as a Luxury hotel. In our past stays at Fairmont, we've always had traditional services and great accommodations. We've been to at least four Fairmont Hotels, and this by far is the worst one ever.To top it all off, we checked it in late at night(12:30 AM) and the front desk lady was very rude, clearly didn't want to be there, and made us very uncomfortable, especially since we had a long flight from NYC. So the Check-in was not a welcoming experience at all. I definitely will not be back at that location, and would warn others from choosing this hotel.",nan,nan,ta_s1888
trip_advisor,"The rooms are pretty dated - there was a dock which only fits IPODs and not iPhones. There was no hot water kettle too as hot water was dispensed from the nespresso machine instead. The capsules for the nespresso machine was not replenished daily. Room service was not fantastic, there are better food places around the hotel. Service at the front desk was good though, that was the best part of my stay.",nan,nan,ta_s1889
trip_advisor,Our meeting was scheduled at the centrally located Fairmont Chicago Millenium Park Hotel.The Hotel Front Desk Services were outstanding with expedited check-in/out services.The Concierge Desk was welcoming and ever ready to help my every need.My room was quiet and soothing.I truly enjoyed the in-room coffee service with my favorite coffee.Lots of great restaurants with-in walking distance.This is the place to stay in Chicago!,nan,nan,ta_s1891
trip_advisor,"I was expect a better service from the fairmont hotel, but this one just delivered average service. The wait time to check in is a bit long due to the people checked in prior to us was complain about they didn't get the room they asked for. When we are checking in, there is no apology about the wait time. I understand is not their fool, but at least try to be polite about it. The room was great, great size, nice and clean. Bed is a bit too soft, but still really comfortable. Second day when we check out, it took no time to check out. They didn't even ask how was my stay, just check me out. Which is another minus. And the bell desk person is a bit impolite when we want to store our luggages, it's not the word he said just the attitude when he is doing his job.Overall, the stay is ok, the hotel deliver what it should deliver. And nothing special about it. Great location with great price. But just ok service.",nan,nan,ta_s1892
trip_advisor,I was in Chicago on business for 3 days. The last time I was at this hotel I was very disappointed. I switched rooms twice because of dingy-ripped carpet and dirty bathrooms. I was pleasantly surprised this visit. The first room I received was very clean. The bed was very comfortable as well as the pillows. The bathroom was impeccable. No mold. This is very important to me. The water pressure was good. The AC works very well. They also have air purifiers in each room. The location is excellent. Short walk to Madison Avenue. The food was very good I ordered both breakfast and dinner from room service. I would definitely recommend this hotel.,nan,nan,ta_s1893
trip_advisor,"This hotel is well well run, polite helpful staff. The rooms are clean and maintained. The beds are excellent. The hotel is in the centre of town and you can walk to all attractions and shopping. I would stay here again , it is not over the top luxury but very easy to live in .",nan,nan,ta_s1894
trip_advisor,"We checked into the Fairmont Chicago on July 6 and checked out July 8. The July 4 weekend crowds were gone, the weather was great, and Chicago was at its stunning best. Our entire experience at the Fairmont was superb. Our lovely room had a great view looking towards the lake. We were lucky to have access to the Gold Lounge and it is impossible to say too much about it. Quiet, classy, with exceptional service. Jackie and Spencer were unfailingly helpful, especially because we arrived in Chicago with no tourist agenda and didn't know where to go or what to do. The staff provided us with great suggestions and helped us find our way to The Art Institute, the Field Museum (within walking distance), as well as how to negotiate the train to visit family. I hope we are fortunate enough to stay at the Fairmont again. I will certainly make th e effort to do so.",nan,nan,ta_s1895
trip_advisor,"My wife came with me to a business meeting and we stay in the very reasonable upgrade to an ""OMG"" suite. Lovely seating area with desk and a table and chair overlooking the lake.Beds were so nice and bathroom is a palace. Room service flawless and prompt. Housekeepers attentive.Nice workout room. Dinner in restaurant was great.And it was Valentine's Day. Oh yes we had fun also.",nan,nan,ta_s1896
trip_advisor,"My wife and I came to Chicago to celebrate my wife's birthday which happens to be on the 4th of July!I booked the hotel with the gold services because of it's name and location. The service exceeded our expectations.While we were on the highway travelling we received an e-mail from Marlene Tapia; the Fairmont Gold Supervisor asking if there was anything she could prepare for us for our arrival and if we had any questions.We requested a room facing the fireworks and suggestions of restaurants and other recommended sites to visit. Within a short time we received. Response that our room was reserved and a list of attractions to see.When we arrived at the hotel to check in Marlene was pleasant and extremely welcoming. With her high energy she booked a boat cruise for the fireworks and gave us an overview of the hotel services.On top of taking care of all above, while we were in the gold room enjoying some snacks on her suggestion a personalized birthday cake was sent to our room for my wife on her birthday.This is just part of the courtesy Marlene showed us and we will return to the Fairmont and Chicago.Needless to say this added to the great experience at the Fairmont Hotel.Thanks for making our trip in Chicago great!Craig and Lillian Cooper",nan,nan,ta_s1897
trip_advisor,We really enjoyed our stay. We had a suite and it was a great size particularly with a toddler. Friend of ours had a standard room that would definitely not of worked with a child! The hotel were very accommodating and even arranged a highchair for our room. It was clean and the bed was very comfortable. The location was fantastic. I could pretty much walk everywhere with my pram and it was easy for my husband to get to the McCormick centre which is where his conference was. Room service was good. The concierge was very helpful and never put us wrong in eating out recommendations or activities.A great trip. - thank you!,nan,nan,ta_s1898
trip_advisor,"Excellent staff! Professional, courteous & caring from the front desk, to the bell man, to the cleaning staff really the whole staff was just fantastic! Good location, close to Magnificent Mile, Millenium Park, the waterfront and some other restaurants. It's also helpful that it's close to a CVS. Not thrilled about internet charges or fee for fitness center--hate being nickled and dimed when I'm at a hotel. Eno Wine Bar was nice--needs more by-the-glass offerings. Decor or lobby and room were really elegant and unique. Breathtaking views of the city skyline--I really enjoyed the view!Bottom line: An elegant escape in the city that's close to perfect.",nan,nan,ta_s1899
trip_advisor,"I stay here often when on business in Chicago. I like that the hotel is quiet at night and the lobby is very nice. Bathrooms are good size too. I usually don't have issues when I am there but this time housekeeping did not leave washcloths in my room twice and they took my extra pillows when they cleaned. Also, a bulb was out in the bath. All was fixed but annoying to have to call to get it done. Love that they have work out clothes for me to use!",nan,nan,ta_s1900
trip_advisor,"I booked a suite for the weekend to celebrate a night out on the town with a friend of mine who is getting married. Made the reservation a month ahead of time, got to the hotel at check in time and was told my suite had been cancelled. Instead, I was given two rooms. This did not work for the group of girls I had coming in. Aside from this, there were no rooms ready when I got there. I had to wait an hour for two rooms to become available. Everyone else in line who had suites were told the same thing. Some people were even asked to pay extra! Typically when a hotel makes such a high mistake, they provide the customer with something free, a breakfast, drink at the bar ect. Not here! All I got was an attitude from the front desk person. For a luxury hotel, they sure have problems keeping their reservations straight! How can anyone book with confidence knowing their reservation can just be cancelled on a whim.",nan,nan,ta_s1901
trip_advisor,"We expected a business hotel in a great location but what we got was soooo much more! The front desk did their best to find an appropriate room for our early check-in and the upgrade cost for the Gold Level paid for itself immediately. The Gold lounge saved the day as my husband and I were able to enjoy early coffee and breakfast while our teenagers slept in. The concierge in the Gold Lounge - Spencer - was an amazing fountain of helpful knowledge. I had booked our family's Chicago get-away on the fly and was really unprepared. Spencer to the rescue! With maps, suggestions, discounted tickets, reservations, you name it, he was ready and able to help maximize our visit....and his advice was always spot-on. Concierge service does not get better. Take full advantage and enjoy your trip like we did.",nan,nan,ta_s1902
trip_advisor,"Stayed one night with our two children. The location was great, an easy walk to the Chicago Loop, a little too far to walk with a toddler and a baby to the Navy Pier. The room was beautiful, the carpet a little shabby, but the rest of the furniture was clean and the beds were super comfortable. Professional check in and beautiful lobby, quiet sleep. No breakfast is served here, but the staff were friendly to us and gave us good tips and ideas of what to see in the city. Pleased overall!",nan,nan,ta_s1903
trip_advisor,First off when I arrived thwre is no free parking 25 a day at the hotel. Then since this was a business trip my office booked the trip with the company credit card. For some reason the hotel didnt have it on file and didnt tell me uat check in they asked for a card for incidentals ok fine then when I checked my balance they charged my card 1600 dollars went to the front found the error changed the card well then they said that money wouldn't be ut back for another 5-7 days what a freaking scam. I definitely will never stay here again and will make sure all the 1000 employees in my company know about this crap. There are many great hotels in chicago for half the amount 5 star hotel what a joke. They also dont tell you there is a fire station next door that blares their sirens about every hour all night long not very fun at all.,nan,nan,ta_s1905
trip_advisor,This is my first time staying at the Fairmont Chicago and I am not disappointed. I informed the hotel that I would arrive early and the staff was able to put me in a room when I arrive shortly before 10am. I was very impressed. The room was spacious and the bed was comfortable. It has a nice view of the lake and the park. The internet is complimentary since I am a member of the Fairmont President Club. The hotel is located within walking distance (10-15 minutes) to the loop and magnificent milesThe only complaint is that some of the exercise equipment in the fitness center were broken.,nan,nan,ta_s1906
trip_advisor,"We got a good deal for 2 nights at the Fairmont. You can tell they put a lot of money into the front entrance as well as the hotel lobby, very modern, very appealing. Right out of the gate, when we made our reservations, we asked for a King bed, we were told, ""No problem, we have plenty of King rooms during your visit!"". So when we checked in, we asked fro a King Room, they we were told it would be an extra $100/night for a King Bed! Unbelieveable! So we were given a room with two double beds! Not queen, but double beds! Not a good way to start the weekend!The rooms were far less appealing than the rest of the hotel. The beds were comfortable, the service was horrible! We returned from a day on the town, roughly 3pm, the room had not been serviced. We checked the door to see if we accidentally left the ""Private"" sign on the knob, nothing there. We called the front desk and asked to have the room cleaned after 6pm, I even tracked down one of the cleaning ladies and told her the same thing...came back to the hotel later that evening...still not cleaned! Follow up on a simple request, please clean the rooms!Should have never left our other hotel! Unfortunately, I would think twice about staying at any Fairmont Hotels again.",nan,nan,ta_s1907
trip_advisor,"The hotel needs to make sure the AC works properly in rooms before checking a guest in. If a guest calls about AC issues its ok to send the maintenance worker, but the front desk needs to make sure the guest is satisfied or willing to change rooms. The guest should not have to get cool air the whole weekend from a baby fan. The hotel staff should not automatically assume people are okay using feather pillows, some ppl are allergic and cannot use them! The view was wonderful. The valet charge was ridiculous. I believe its not worth it, I could have had a better stay at a Quality Inn",nan,nan,ta_s1908
trip_advisor,"My wife and I, living in the Chicago suburbs for the past 30 years, had the change to spend two weekend nights at the Fairmont Chicago in April. We were very pleasantly surprised at how good a time we had. The location of the hotel provided a convenient central base to explore not only the nearby sites such as Millennium Park, but the new next door area named Lakeshore East, and since we had a car, made it easy to visit the Museum Campus and even down to Hyde Park and the University of Chicago area. We also tried out the new DIVVY rental bikes which have a spot very close to the hotel. The Aria restaurant had a variety of breakfast menu items that ranged from the traditional Eggs Benedict to an innovative and delicious Country Benedict with a poached egg on a biscuit covered with a pork and gravy sauce. There were ample refills on orange juice and the tea came in a pot so you could have several cups. The valet parking was very convenient on the lower level, although one can do from the main entrance as well.",nan,nan,ta_s1909
trip_advisor,"It was our first time in Chicago and we have no regrets. The hotel is very well located, with big rooms, and a good service. It's a big hotel, so you don't have a lot of individual attentions. For example, they didn't tell us about the stores that we could go through the lower level of the hotel, we discovered unconsciously, and it's a very important information because of the cold weather. Other thing to point out is something not essential but I think they can improve: the shower is a little bit weak (I don't know if it's the perfect word to describe).",nan,nan,ta_s1910
trip_advisor,"We stayed here over Easter weekend and had a mostly enjoyable experience. The rate was a little higher than some neighboring and similar hotels. The hotel was quite dead the entire weekend. We only saw a handful of people all weekend and never heard them on our floor. The restaurants are similarly dead. Not a great place to catch a nightcap. The hotel is conveniently located in Millennium Park. The staff are very friendly and accommodating. Some of the best service I've ever received. The rooms were quite clean and modern. Two minor complaints: the staff never replaced our toilet paper all weekend and we ran out (had to call) and the shower didn't drain correctly and the water pressure was weak. Other than that, it was an enjoyable stay. I'm not sure I'd stay here again with all of the other attractive and cheaper hotel options in the area, but an enjoyable experience overall.",nan,nan,ta_s1911
trip_advisor,"We went here for my wife's birthday. We originally booked a Gold room, but at the last minute decided to go with a Gold suite. I think a gold room would have been plenty large enough. A Gold room provides you access to the Gold lounge which provides a continental breakfast which is more like a light buffet and Hors d'oeuvre in the evening which were quite substantial. Also, don't miss the deserts later in the evening. You do have to pay for alcoholic beverages in the lounge and be prepared to pay hotel prices. The staff at the hotel was excellent. From the time the bellman took our luggage at arrival until a bellman hailed us a cab at departure, all staff were friendly and helpful. Jackie and Marlene were particularly helpful in answering questions before our arrival. The location is outstanding. The views can be fabulous. I would ask for a South or East view. As an added plus, there is a deli and grocery store right around the corner if there is something you want or need. We are already making plans for our next trip to the Fairmont.",nan,nan,ta_s1912
trip_advisor,"This hotel was pretty lovely. It's not over the top in your face but it's very nice. I really enjoyed my stay.The room was wonderful and the view of the lake amazing! The bath products are great.
