"The location is fantastic. I had a view of the lake and could walk everywhere I wanted in the area. My complaints are, no free wifi, no refrigerator, no exhaust in the bathroom, overpriced parking and the rooms are worse than a newer Sleep Inn or Super 8. At this price why in the world would the management make people mad by something so simple as charging for the wifi and no refrigerator in the room? Do you want bad reviews for something this simple and cheap to provide?I parked directly across the street for $30- vs $55- at the hotel. If you are going to charge for parking, why are you ripping people off for an extra $25- a night? Even the employees told me to park over there since the price was too high at the hotel. Management drops the ball yet again. The management gets NO Stars for ripping people off on these simple items.On a high note, most of the employees were friendly and room was clean. The location couldn't be better.

"This was a pleasant surprise. For such a large hotel it had the feel of a smaller facility.Nice front desk staff and accommodations. The rooms were redone and beautifully appointed. There was opportunity for a lake view ( front of building) or the back where you might view city buildings. However there is an El running by which is very noisy so if you want a good sleep ask for the front of the building!.The bars were nice looking, I do not drink so I cannot say much about their selections.The Sunday Buffet was quite tasty. Not very extensive but we were part of a wedding party. Very good drink service as an added note."
"I rated this 4/5 because some minor attention to details were overlooked by Housekeeping in my room. There were some hairs in the shower (wall and floor) that were present prior to use. In addition, there were similar hairs present on the bathroom floor. It's my belief, the presence were so obvious, the housekeeper or supervisor should have identified prior to the room being re-circulated. In addition, my in-room refrigerator did not cool. A standalone replacement was delivered to my room while I was at dinner. My 5/5 is reserved for a flawless experience.That said, I would recommend this hotel and my future visits will consist of staying at this hotel. This is a first class property in a major city, you won't find too many bargains at the in-house restaurants or from room service. Food quality and service at the 720 Restaurant is great especially, since restaurants offering table service are at a minimum IMMEDIATELY surrounding the hotel. Go Airport Express or similar transportation service is probably the most efficient means of arriving/departing the hotel if you don't have a rental key. This company seems to have preferred status since you can confirm or change reservations using your in room hotel computer. Service was quick, effective, and not to cost prohibitive. The hotel is about 1.6 miles from the heart of the magnificent mile shops. A taxi ride is about $10 one-way including tips.I would suggest a higher floor, if you're not familiar with urban traffic noise, which isn't overly noisy because of the construction quality of the historic building. Housekeeping management should consider adding more trash cans in the room (only 1). This would help keep the coffee/tea preparation area cleaner since in this room (which was very wide) the trash can was on the other side of the room.


Room Tip: Higher room may be better for urban traffic noise.

"We recently stayed at the Hilton Chicago and unknowingly timed it at the same time a Gala was being held in the hotel. We were impressed by the grand decorations and the excitement that came with the busyness of the hotel. Unfortunately, the rest of the experience was mediocre, our room was small and dark. There were stains on one of the pillow casing and the toilet also had some nastier stains on the side of the bowl. There was also hair left in the sink. I recalled how the front desk offered to upgrade our room to one of the new renovated rooms for an extra $40 US. Since we were only staying one night we said no and thought it wouldn't be a big deal. Looking back, Maybe the extra $40 is a secret fee to getting cleaner rooms. Another issue was we thought being an Hhonours member we would get free wifi, however, we were informed that since we had booked the hotel with Expedia we would not be receiving this service. This rule seemed strange to me, since we also stayed at Sofitel Chicago Water Tower and we received complimentary wifi even though we weren't part of their hotel membership program and the hotel had also been booked through Expedia. Overall, the Hilton lacked the service we expected from its past reputation. On a good note the location of the hotel is amazing. It's close to the beautiful parks in Chicago, and even more beautiful at night when the street lamps and building lights are all lit up. It's accessible by transit, or you can also self park at the hotel parking for $55U.S. , which is average in Chicago. I wouldn't stay at Hilton Chicago again, there are plenty of other hotels close by that can probably provide clean rooms without requiring an upgrade."
"This hotel was apparently once the largest in the world, I can tell. It's very big and very confusing to navigate, especially for a conference/tradeshow. They do have solild amenities everywhere, making your stay their very easy and convenient. The rooms are smallish. For some reason they still have a full desktop in your room that stays on (bright) all night unless turned off manually. Seems very outdated. The location is good so I would likely stay again."
"I stayed here for one Saturday night. The check-in process was good because I used the Hilton honors line. I had a room on the executive level with two beds and two bathrooms. Had a great view of lake Michigan. I didn't take advantage of all the services that the hotel had to offer such as free refreshments, free continental breakfast, concierge, etc. Great location. Staff was friendly too. Can't think of anything to complain about."
"We booked this hotel for a one-night getaway after being treated like family during our last visit & enjoying a terrific, clean room.Unfortunately that was not the case on this visit. First, although I had called ahead to verify that we qualified for a specific discount, the check in-clerk quibbled over the price, and started to tell me it could be more than $30/night higher than I reserved the room for. I reminded her that I had called and spoken with her that very morning to verify the rate before booking, and she acquiesced, giving us a rate that was only $5 more than I had reserved it for. I decided at that point not to argue, as we were already committed to staying, and I knew that was still a low rate for Chicago. What happened did leave me feeling unwelcome and like my repeat business was not appreciated, especially as an Hhonors customer. However, I did appreciate them allowing us an early check-in time.The room we were placed in was on a high floor & far from the elevators, allowing some peace and quiet. I was satisfied with the decor and the comfort of the bed, as well as the overall cleanliness of the bathroom, carpet and bedding. However, there was a thick layer of dust next to the nightstands and between the bed and the wall. There was a thinner, but visible layer of dust along the headboard, lamps, and the in-room computer screen. I was disappointed by this, as our previous room here had been so fastidiously clean! Overall, although it was still acceptable, there were several things which could be improved upon during this visit, and which I hope the management of this grand old place will notice.

"Location: This Hilton is smack in the center of downtown Chicago just blocks from The Art Institute and Millennium Park. It's also just blocks from the Loop El Train (Chicago's subway), and a multitude of restaurants, albeit most cater to the expense account traveler and are not necessarily designed to be affordable. Inside: the LARGE room was immaculately clean, as were the hallways and the lobby. The hotel oozes 1920s charm, with velvet sofas, brass elevator doors, and chandeliers. There is nothing cookie cutter about this hotel. The beds were very very comfortable and the thermostat was very easy to use. There was, oddly, no coffee maker in the room, nor was there a fridge or minibar.Amenities: The hotel itself has numerous bars and restaurants should you decide not to go hunting for food. There's also a Starbucks for your morning coffee, but the line in the morning is quite long. Still, there are about five others within walking distance. We did not use room service. Wifi is NOT free unless you are a Hilton HHonors member, and even then you will have to argue with the desk clerk. We only stayed one night, and did not use the gym/spa/etc. so cannot speak to those amenities. Parking is expensive. $45 for self park, $75 for valet.Value: Parking aside, the cost per night here, at the time that we stayed in mid-April was about $250 per night. This was pretty good considering that much of the city was booked by the time we tried to find a room and comparable hotels were $350 and up."
"I had the opportunity to stay here for two nights for a conference that was hosted at the hotel. I haven't stayed at this hotel for probably close to 15 years. The rooms appear to have been updated since that time and the room was great. The rooms are older style (somewhat small), but it had everything you need. The bed was extremely comfortable and the housekeeping was great. The express checkout was no problem and if I needed something the room service was outstanding. Check-in was also extremely fast and there was staff on-site for directions, or other questions when needed. Staff was very helpful and friendly as well. I will stay here again, given the opportunity. I went for a run along the lake that and it was less than a half mile to access the lakefront ""trail""."
"Arrived early to check in on a Saturday. There was a line, but it moved relatively fast. Room was comfortable and had recently been updated. If you are a light sleeper, I suggest you request a higher floor as there is some noise from trains. I do think that it is poor form that they charge to hold bags especially because the room rates are not cheap. A little goodwill goes a long way Hilton.


Room Tip: Light sleepers should request higher floors.

"My wallet was stolen on April 13th in the Starbucks on Wabash - lost everything. I was leaving via Midway that day and traveling with my daughter. We did not have carfare to get to the airport due to the theft. Doorman, Benji, at this Hilton heard my plight and volunteered all the cash he had in his pocket to help me. This is service above and beyond and I will not forget Benji's kindness to a stranger in need at the Chicago Hilton. By the way, the hotel is beautiful and everything you expect in a fine city hotel."
"This historic hotel, located on the infamous Michigan Avenue, is a wonderful mashup of old-world charm with modern influences. The hotel boasts beautiful ornate artwork while also having more modern areas such as the cafe/store (which serves Starbucks), and the three restaurants located on the Lobby level. BE FOREWARNED: the hotel does NOT have air conditioning. During my stay, Chicago...

"I'm here alone for a conference. The room is fine. Not an option for my family of 4 because the two bed rooms are double beds, which are too tiny for an adult and large child. There's room for larger beds in most hotel rooms yet it is always hard to find such places. Why?The place is huge. Took a day to figure out the conference rooms. The rooms are not ideal for sound because rooms pickup sound from other rooms. I'm on a workout kick and headed to the gym. Learned they wanted $15 to use the equipment. Really?! It's a nice gym but I'm used to places where there is no fee to work out. It's not like someone is giving you a massage. The front desk gave it to me complimentary when I whined about it. There are quick notes to eat a short walk from hotel. It's ridiculously cold out, however so many may not want to walk. I'd choose this hotel if rooms were better for families if I wanted to go to the nearby museums, but the double beds are a huge minus. There is room for one or two air beds, so that's an option if you wanted to bother bringing such items or if hotel could guarantee roll always. In short, the location, the elegant space, and the nice accommodations make this a great choice for 1 or 2 people."
"It really is disturbing that WiFi is not included. Internet its not a luxury or an extra, it is as important as having a bathroom in the room!Very nice hotel otherwise, nice service, beautiful room and great location. We were encouraged to use the rooms internal computer to order room service except that didn't work so we used the old fashioned way and called on the handset. Perhaps they are struggling with technology?

My stay at the Hilton Chicago was excellent. Everyone was very accommodating and friendly from the minute we stepped into the hotel. The bell hop was funny and very nice. The hallways had a very faint good smell. I can't put my finger on what the smell was but it was delightful. We stayed on the 9th floor which has been remodeled and it was beautiful. We had a room facing the lake and we watched as a line of snow came across the lake. Sunrise was beautiful. There was a refrigerator in the room even though their website doesn't say anything about one being in the room. That was a plus. I don't usually like the smell of the bathroom toiletries but I did like the smell of the toiletries in the hotel! I recommend staying here. Had a great time.
"If you would LOVE to stay at one of the most beautiful Hotels in the city, the Hilton and Towers is it. I do believe it is called the Hilton Chicago now.It dates back to before Al Capone and is Just as beautiful now as the pictures and books i have seen and read of the place. The service was cery good and the food and bars are excellent. They have everything you need from internet to big Flat screen TV`s, Very reasonable rooms (some that even have two bathrooms) that come in very handy. It`s right across the street from gorgeous Grant Park and just a Very quick walk from the Field Museum, Shedd Aquarium and Planetarium along with Soldier field and 2 BIG Marinas on the lake.The People who work there from parking cars to Taking your reservations to management are extremely helpful and friendly!

"Front desk gave us incorrect room information so we went up to the room we were given (19th floor) and found that the keys didn't work. Mistakes happen, but this kind of thing is a major drag after traveling. Front desk should have a bit more attention to detail. Room was spacious and comfortable. Furnishings need to be updated, but were otherwise comfortable. Was strange to have two bathrooms in the double room. Hotel staff should play up the hotel's storied past more, it's quite fascinating.

"Don't get me wrong-this place it's stunning, beautiful, breathtaking. But they must be doing some renovations. We stayed two nights and all I heard during the day were hammers and saws. I understand it has to be done at some time and with it being winter I'm sure now is the best time. However, the walls were so thin, I could hear everything that was going on. Showers running, toilets flushing. So loud it would wake you from your sleep. Also, no king bed rooms were ready at our arrival. This was a large conference however, a conference the hotel was aware of far in advance.Despite these annoyances, we had a pleasant, enjoyable stay."
"Recently spoke at a conference that was hosted at the hotel, the entire experience was seamless from check-in to check-out and beyond. Great service orientation at the hotel. Every interaction - front desk/bell stand, audio-video crew, banquet staff, awesome shoe shine guy. My room was comfortable even with the sub-zero temperatures and wind outside.

"I really struggled to rate this hotel poor, instead of terrible. After bringing my concerns immediately to the attention of the front desk upon check-in the staff failed to apologize or offer to change my room. All this hotel has going for it is location. The hotel is less then standard, and is need of some serious updating and CLEANING. After returning home, I once again contacted them with my concerns. Unfortunately I was connected with the same individual (Shawn) who really could of cared less about me, the hotel he represents, or seeing me return as a guest. Hit the abort button now if your considering a stay at this hotel. Check out the Blackstone."
"We stayed at this Hilton for a weekend sporting event at McCormick place. The location is awesome, the lobby and amenities are very nice, and the room was good.

"What a pleasant surprise. I booked the Hilton because I was in town for a convention and simply wanted to stay at a Hilton for the Honors points. This was not just another generic convention hotel. Spectacular entry area--they don't build 'em like this anymore. Large, well set-up workout / pool area. Rates were surprisingly low (of course it was January in Chicago). It was walkable to some of the tourist attractions, but a bit far from the heart of shopping. Front desk staff was very welcoming and professional. I will definitely stay again when in Chicago."
"I attended a conf in early January and stayed at the Hilton. What an awesome place. It was -30 degrees outside but my room was warm, comfortable and well maintained. The location was excellent. I did go out 2 times during the conf- plenty of cabs available as it was too cold to walk- great doormen always ready to help. I really enjoyed Kitty O'Shea's, the Irish bar. The waitress did say they just changed the menu and she needed more info on the menu- seemed like they just rolled it out. But great atmosphere and good food. I will return."
"This is why I love Chicago an why I love Hilton. The energy of this city is contagious and this hotel is right in the middle of it. The bellman was friendly & helpful w bags, front desk person was too. Nothing better than getting off a flight and out of a cab & being greeted by a friendly bellman, carried forward to a friendly front desk person - it just sets the tone - thank you Hilton for understanding this! I like that there is a Starbucks close to elevators & outside doors for the coffee to go. Even w a huge convention at the hotel, the staff was friendly & efficient. Good restaurants in the hotel and a place worth staying if your plans bring you to Chicago. A great city and a great hotel!"
"I reviewed this hotel a while back and had not been impressed due to the dated nature of the room I was in. I received a response from hotel staff, which I appreciated. When I knew that I would stay at this hotel again, I replied to the hotel staff person and let them know that. When I arrived, they had arranged for appetizer and breakfast coupons for me, which was a nice touch. The room I stayed in was nicely updated, had a mini-fridge in it, and was quite comfortable. The bathroom was cold due to the ceramic tile floor (and a Chicago winter), and while there was an additional baseboard heater in the bathroom, it was not sufficient to keep up with the cold. The temp wasn't bad, just a bit cool. Otherwise the room was quite nice and much more what I would expect. I appreciated the follow-up from the staff after my earlier review. I would stay here again, most definitely.


Green Features: They had a bag in the room requesting any paper, etc., which could be recycled - an idea I wish others (including in the Hilton chain) would adopt! Great!"
"We are one day into our stay and there is time for the hotel to redeem itself.Booked into this hotel four months before arriving based on reviews and the fact we wanted to spend a little extra on what we assumed would be a superb hotel room. Traveling from Scotland to attend a conference and wanted a little bit of luxury after a 35 hour journey due to delays.Arrived to hear that the ""Executive Rooms"" were ""closed for renovation"", although having just watched a couple of people go up through the private lifts used to access the floors. No notification of this in advance which should have been an option as the Palmer House Hilton offers the same room with all the same amenities as a much more affordable price and we would have happily switched hotels.The gentleman then charged us a $50 surcharge per night incidentals, even though it is usually a single charge and not one per night in other hotels. Furthermore, he tried to charge us the full amount of our original booking - a room that would have included breakfast, wifi, a private lounge and much more - for a simple double room. My friend then argued with him to decrease the price of the room to what we were actually getting, as opposed to paying $500 more. Offered some vouchers which we explained would not be worth our time as we have a jam packed week with meetings. The manager later offered us complimentary wifi but nothing else for the error and hassle caused. He was also adamant that we were in an upgraded room that was very similar to the room we would have gotten... except that it has none of the extras we desired. A basic double room is what we have been given. I would have been extremely happy to pay the price I originally agreed if we were given a room better than the one we booked but without the executive amenities, if the floor was closed for renovations. It was their legal responsibility to offer us what we booked, and they did not do that.Legally, it is the hotel's responsibility to update their availability and ensure the details of a room is being booked, even if through a third party site. After all, once that reservation has been made, it's legally binding. Came back to the room late afternoon to get showered and changed for dinner and it still hadn't been serviced, had to call reception and ask them to send up some fresh towels. I understand it is a large hotel but I assume I am not the only person that does this before dinner and it seems quite irregular.Location wise, it's good. The services on offer around the lobby are excellent. I tried to contact the hotel in November to get the details for the beauty salon to try and book in for the trip and received no reply to two emails and one phone call.Be warned that the rooms at the side of hotel suffer from a lot of noise for trains going past, but I will admit the beds are comfy."
"The basics that you love about your typical Hilton Hotel along with thier typical attention to detail have been lost. From lack luster hallways to counter staff that choose not to directly address billing items and push resolution on to you the customer, this location falls down on a brand promise to make it right. Pair this with paid wifi access (who still does this) limited gym access and well worn bathrooms and you've got a recipe for unhappy visitors."
"I stayed two nights here and I would not recommend this hotel to anyone unless they would like to spend extra money of every little thing. First, there are charges to use the fitness facility (i.e. pool, sauna, gym equipment). There are charges per Wi-Fi connection in the room also and parking charges are OUTRAGEOUS! It's $72 for valet parking. I was prepared to spend a decent amount of money on the hotel charge but never expected to be nickel and dimed throughout my stay. There was also no fridge or microwave in my hotel room."
"Admittedly we were there over the New Year's Eve period but waiting 10-15 minutes for an elevator every time you went downstairs, fighting crowds to get into the elevators or to the Cafe and rooms and corridors that look like they were last renovated when JFK was in office isn't hat I expected from a Hilton. Calling it a landmark and a classic isn't an excuse for letting it get old and packing join too many people for the old-age facilities. Staff were efficient but grumpy - apart from the serving staff in the Restaurant 720 South who were very good most of the other staff were grumpy and begrudging - felt like I was doing something wrong to ask simple assistance - so after a while I just stopped. I'm sure that there are a lot of better places in Chicago so I won't be going back - and I am a Diamond HHonours Guest!

"We took our girls to stay here for the weekend during the 1D Concert at Soldier Field. The lobby and parking drop off was an absolute zoo - thankful I was hilton honors as the line for normal check in was three times as long as ours. Other than that aspect, the rooms are clean, spacious and quiet for this old brick gem. It has been updated- but you pay for it. Parking, water, wi-fi, breakfast are high - downtown prices. But you can walk to soldier field, the Bean, coffee shops and a few other ""chains"" right around the corner to mitigate expenses. We overlooked the pale facing the lake and could see Navy Pier; the down side is the traffic noise and the 6 am Sunday morning race in the park - you could hear every announcement and the music was loud. But that is summer in Chicago- this is an iconic hotel fit for any traveler - family, business, or weekend getaway. Millers pub was packed both nights after the concert and I will say they did NOT plan accordingly for the post concert rush at the market / Starbucks. Starving teenage girls at 11 pm don't want to hear you are out of anything! Be wary going out the back of the hotel - stay in groups - but it is beautiful and the service was spot on."
"Have stayed at this hotel many times, last was the worst. We had a king suite with 2 baths, which is great, View of the lake, was awesome. Also had a bar and another king Murphy bed-when was the last time you saw a Murphy bed? It was in the living area, I could have put it up, but we put our bags on it. Great location to the Art Museum, Grant park is across the street. Now the bad- lounge which had snacks, sodas, and breakfast was closed, opening???? They did not know. No robes, slippers in room-this was a king premium suite. My bad I did not bring these, I had assumed, as prior visits, they would be there. We liked the pool area/hot tubs; but one day they had a red-neck luncheon with loud 15 adults and 20+ kids in and out of the hot spas, which by the way are not allowed, I guess they have trailer park rates-I wonder who they left behind to watch the double wides. I complained and got 2 breakfast coupons, good for the Sunday brunch-which was no different than the daily spread. Waiters were good- they do have a fantastic eggs benedict-you have to ask for it, different and delicious. We wanted a getaway weekend, disappointed. Stay at the Palmer house, great hotel, great bar.Went on Michigan Ave to look at the Christmas displays, called ""white devils"" by black panthers chanting on sidewalk, welcome to Obama's America.We will stay in New York. Also tons of preteens at the hotel at some youth conference, running and screaming in the hotel constantly.

"The staff was very friendly and helpful at our recent stay at the Hilton. We were looking for just a quick overnight stay that would lend itself to touring downtown Chicago and letting the kids hang in the pool in the evening and the morning. The Hilton delivered. Location was great, the front desk staff was very nice and bonus that our standard double room had TWO bathrooms! Makes life a lot easier when you are a mom of two girls...the rooms have been recently renovated, so they are modern and clean. Probably the only downside is that movie rental is pricey. But I suppose that comes with downtown hotel territory. We are planning our return trip next Christmas break. Such a fun thing for parents and kids to do together!"
The Hilton New Years Eve party is a joke and I will not attend again. It was misrepresented on the website about what you get for the ticket price. DO not waste your money. $150 per ticket. No balloon drop. No toast at midnight. Bartenders were slow and service stopped at 1:00am. It took on average a half hour to get a drink. No place to sit down. Website said multiple ballrooms and there was only one available. Website also spoke of casino games but they were no where to be found. Avoid this party at all cost. Save your money.
"I really recommend this hotel for people visiting Chicago. I always stay there. It gets better and better, It's conveniently located with great views of the lake and on the park and near to shopping. The gym, pool and spa are all well maintained and not overcrowded given a hotel this size. I stayed over the New Year's holiday. The hotel was full and catered to a wedding as well as the usual new year's crowd. Service and security were excellent. All staff were friendly, as usual and anxious to please. Breakfast and dinner were well prepared and served. And for me a mark of excellence is clean bathrooms. I will continue to stay here on my trips to Chicago.

"We stayed here to ring in the New Year at the hotel. We checked in on Tuesday December 30 and was planning to stay until January 3, 2015. On Wednesday night there was a NYE party at the hotel which required party goers to wear arm bands. My wife and I had dinner reservations in the hotel at 720 Restaurant. When we finished dinner, we were heading to the elevators and noticed security checking arm bands of people before allowing them to the elevator. We were able to get by with the purple arm bands we were wearing. Later in the night around 1am, we were heading up to our room but was not allowed to because we did not have a yellow arm band. We proceeded to the front desk to find out why we were not told about this at check-in on Tuesday. The worker told us that they did not get the yellow arm bands until Wednesday and the checking for yellow arm bands went into affect at 6:00 pm. He also informed us that a message was left on our phone informing us of this. Remember, we were able to get up to our room wearing purple arm bands at 6:45pm. Once we got up to our room, we did not find a message on our phone informing us of the need for yellow arm bands. Two lies within 2 minutes of each other. As a Hilton Honors member who travels quite a bit, I was very turned off by this and very upset. The next day I went to speak to someone at the front desk to find out if it was normal practice to lie to guest and I was informed it was not. This person said that they would give me all four nights of my stay for $99.00 per night. When I received my bill the morning of check out, that was not the case. Lie number 3. Checking with the front desk to find out why the correction was not made, it appeared that I was an inconvenience to her. She left or 10 minutes to discuss with the manager about what could be done. In the end I got the price as stated above. I also used the concierge desk on several occasions and found the same person to be very rude both times. All you could get form her was, ""how can I help you"". Nothing along the lines of good morning how are you, nothing. Again it gave the appearance of an inconvenience for her having to assist someone. The people that run the Herb and Kitchen give the appearance that they are clueless at their jobs. It should not take 25 minutes to get 2 coffees and a Danish, but it did. We did receive great service at the bar and from the bell hops. Other than those two bright spots, this was by far the worse stay I have ever had at a Hilton property. Nest time I am in Chicago, I will not be staying there."
"I just returned from our annual meeting in Chicago. Since the meeting was at McCormick Place, I chose a hotel closer to the Center but with a good reputation. I arrived very early, so I couldn't check in to my room. My phone number was taken so that I could be called when the room was ready. No surprise, I never got a phone call. When I checked in that evening, I was ""upgraded"" to a City View room. I can't imagine what my non-upgraded room was! I had a view of other rooms and the building across the street. Oh well, I guess not having status with Hilton makes a difference and I don't have status! Anyway, the room was a spacious king. However, the toilet seat wouldn't stay up and the tub drained very slowly. I was only here for 3 nights, so I managed. Yes, I could have called, but you'd think that housekeeping would notice. Anyway, the hotel itself was beautiful, and even though it was marathon weekend, I never waited long for an elevator. The bed was comfortable, the room clean and the location of the hotel was what I needed. Next time, though, a hotel on the Mag Mile north of the river would be better. There was always a need to take a cab to restaurants, etc. Overall, I was satisfied, but I think that only being a Blue level member hurts you at the Chicago Hilton. If the price is right, staying here is fine. It is a full service hotel, with restaurants, hair services, shops, and even a shoe shine. Would I stay here again? If I had to. There are just so many other choices in this city that are more convenient."
"We took the Amtrak train to visit Chicago with our two sons, ages 8 and 10. I chose the Hilton Chicago because it was at the midway point between the Amtrak station and the attractions that we wanted to see. We arrived at Union Station a little after lunchtime on a Friday and carried our bags to the hotel. It was just over a mile and was easy to find. After depositing our suitcases, we hiked back the way we came to visit the Willis tower that afternoon. We had walked right by it on our way to the hotel but didn't want to try to take our luggage up the tower. We spent the next 3 days visiting Field Museum, the Museum of Science and Industry, and the Shedd Aquarium. The Field and Shedd are roughly one mile from the hotel and easy to walk to. There is a Metra Electric train station a block from the hotel which will take you to the Museum of Science and Industry. It was $3 each way and took 20 min (on weekends kids ride free too - Bonus!)The hotel location was perfect for our trip. I was also pleased with our room. When we checked in, they said we were in the recently renovated portion of the hotel. It had nice decor and enough room for the 4 of us to move around comfortably. The breakfast is horribly overpriced (as per usual at these level of hotels) but there are starbucks and other places to pick up food nearby. There is also Starbucks in the small cafe in the hotel itself. For dinner, there are many restaurants nearby within walking distance. We were tired and cold one night (we visited in December) after returning to the hotel so we opted to eat at the Irish grill there. It was uninspiring food, but decent and filling. And they had a decent beer selection. If you need to pick up a snack or something for breakfast in your room, there is a 7-11 store 2 blocks from the hotel. So I was very happy with how this hotel worked out for our stay and would recommend it."
Myself and my son stayed in this hotel during visit to Chicago .It is a great hotel with spacious rooms .The outlook is traditional .I gather that this hotel is an old one right from world war 2 times .The ball room gives a majestic look .The places to visit in Chicago are located near to the hotel with the subway station at a walkable distance from hotel .Hence we could move around places through subway train.
"We were celebrating the end of my cancer treatments and we couldn't have chosen a better place. The suite was very nice, the bed super comfy and the room very clean. The holiday decorations were beautiful and I loved the hotel trivia in the elevator. Learned some very cool things about the property while riding up and down. The pool area was very nice and we enjoyed the hot tub. Kitty O'Shea's was OK, not the best, but not bad. The doormen were very helpful and the location was convenient to the museums and shopping. There is not one bad thing to report on this historic property. We stayed in room 1163 and could see the lake from our room. Thank you, Hilton, for always providing as great stay!


Green Features: The Hilton offered recycling bags in the room, which I thought was wonderful!"
"I stayed for one night at the Hilton Chicago, in November. When I reserved the room, parking was included in my rate. When I arrived at the hotel the valet guys told me to go ahead an park and keep the ticket and they would validate at the front desk. I arrived before 3:00p.m. and was able to check in right away. I got to my room and was really surprised at how spacious it was. I've stayed at other hotels in Chicago and the rooms are much smaller. It was nice to have the extra space. My room faced the skyline of Chicago so I couldn't complain about the view. I was in Chicago to do some shopping and visit some friends, so I didn't take advantage of the amenities the hotel has to offer, but it all looked great. The location is great. A bit South of all the shopping on Michigan Ave, but the walk is well worth it. It is across from Grant Park, near Millenium Park and the Field Museum. I would definitely stay here again when visiting Chicago."
"Very fine hotel and staff! I always stay here! I have noticed they are cutting back on maintenance and some of the wonderful attractions, like the gingerbread house by the elevators etc. I hate to see these little things go away! It's part of the Chicago Hilton tradition to which many of us have become accustomed at Christmas! Kittie(sp?) O'Shea's is open only on a limited basis. It was closed on Tuesday before the Midwest Clinic this year. Kittie's has ALWAYS BEEN the gathering place for Directors from around the world on Tuesday before Midwest. Shame! Seems like someone should notice these things before booking a private party in to Kittie O'Shea's before Midwest........."
"I had the opportunity to stay at the Hilton over the weekend, and as has been the case for years, the stay was wonderful. The location across from Grant Park, near Millenium Park and Museum Campus, is the best in the Loop.The check-in was easy as you can now choose your room online prior to arriving. The Athletic Club pool and sauna were a great way to start and/or end the day and the rooms were well appointed. The Executive Level is under renovation and the Concierge Desk and Executive Lounge are closed. Floors 25 and 22 are open. They are giving certificates for breakfast, (be sure you get the one for the weekend 720 Breakfast Buffet) and evening appetizers at Kitty O'Shea's. I was told the first stage will be completed in February and then they'll swap to the other floors.The grand Christmas Tree was up, but sadly no Gingerbread House this year. We had a great swtay and will return to see how the new renovations turned out.

"Stayed for one night on the 20th of December. Check in was fine except for the staff member trying to convince me that I didn't want the room with the king sized bed I'd paid for and that she was doing me a favour by offering me a room with two doubles or a 'Murphy bed'. After much faff I was finally given the room I'd originally asked for. Call me old fashioned but I don't equate two doubles or a drop down occasional bed to a standard king size. The hotel was obviously pretty busy due to the debutants ball but still no reason to shaft paying customers. The room itself was decent and reflected the price paid. It had apparently been refurbished but after a night of interrupted sleep it was pretty clear that the recent works did not extend to upgrading the non existent sound proofing. From kids mouthing off in the halls to the sounds of drunken revellers/sirens etc outside, it was pretty tough to sleep. On the plus side the bar downstairs is pretty decent and the location is a plus. I certainly wouldn't chose to stay again unless the deal was irresistible. Definitely stayed in worse, certainly stayed in better."
"Service - Nothing special, they are all accommodating, you'll get in almost all Hilton Hotels.Room - My room was small since it was under corporate rate, but I had a wonderful view of Sears/Willis Tower and it was clean.Food - As long they serve good bacon and omelet for breakfast I'm happy.., which they did.Location - Very near Millennium Park, Museums, Restaurants, Bars, 7/11, and Malls.Price - I cannot comment much since it was a company paid trip.


Room Tip: Ask for a room away where the side of the train is.

we stayed over several nights. The hotel was very clean and looked amazing for the holidays. Over two nights they had a convention with high school or college kids. OMgosh!!! yelling and banging and screaming all night in the hallways. We called the front desk many times and nothing ever improved. Other hotels were full and booked so we coundnt move out. They offered us a free breakfast. serioulsy.... so frusterating they have a great location and facility just poor management for such nonsence
The hotel and setting is very beautiful . We stayed 2 nights in mid december. The hotel was hosting some large youth convention. The young adult vistors were completely out of control. We were awoken several times during the night with yelling and running in the halls. We contacted the front desk who said they would send security but it never improved. The next night we were moved to a different floor. Breakfast buffet had a long wait both mornings.
"The Hotel was located in a wonderful area of Chicago. The Chicago Towers is a good stay for the price. I was however a little bit disturbed by the lack of maid service two days in a row. Coming in from a long day working to a dirty room twice is not my ideal of a Hilton hotel. Other service was wonderful so I rate service as an average. Probably should of complained, but I was too busy and too tired."
"I usually prefer not to stay in large hotels. I find them often impersonal and difficult to get around. This Hilton proved me wrong. I arrived late, sick and hungry. The central location of the elevators made access to any room fairly easy. Maybe December is slow, but it seemed that there were helpful staff everywhere. Nice choice of restaurants were open late....and early. Convenient plugs for chargers were helpful. Shampoo and products were nice. Room was a bit small...but fine. Excellent experience."
"The Hilton Chicago is our family's preferred hotel choice when visiting Chicago. Since it is located 3 blocks from our kids' grandparents' condo, it is conveniently located and accessible to the activities that we plan. Our experience began well before our check-in date when we received a *proactive* email notification from Mr. Nicosia, Manager of the Executive Floors, who, by the way, is an immensely valuable asset to the Hilton Chicago. The email made sure we understood the Executive Lounge would be closed due to renovations during our stay, but our breakfast and evening hors d'oeuvres would be provided by the lobby restaurants. One of the unique privileges of staying on the Executive Floor is the access to the Lounge. The breakfast buffet is beyond expectations and the evening receptions are equally impeccable. Our kids were saddened to know that the *more* family-friendly breakfast from the Executive Lounge would not be accessible. We used the online check-in feature and chose our room (fantastic convenience) a day before arrival. An issue with our credit card was quickly resolved with a brief phone call to Robert in Guest Services. We inquired on much more a Junior Suite upgrade would cost and also explained that our kids were saddened to know that the Executive Lounge was closed. Robert asked how the hotel could help in maintaining guest satisfaction and offered a possible option. Although comping the upgrade was not within his scope of empowerment, Robert did offer us a wonderful alternative. That was fantastic! Upon arrival to the hotel, Jermish(sp?) tried to locate our key packet and Executive Floor coupons for the lobby restaurants. However, she could not find them. She couldn't even find our reservation in the computer. I had to give her our reservation number and stated we utilized the online check-in feature. She found us. She gave us our key packet, but did not give us our coupons. I asked for them and she asked if we were on the Executive Floor. Um... yes. It took her about 10 minutes to create the coupon packet. She did apologize as the items were not pre-made. What was supposed to be a brief get our keys/coupons and go, turned into a 15 minute (at least, it felt that long) ordeal. We entered our room and found out our advance request for hypoallergenic foam pillows and extra bath towels were NOT delivered. Upon returning to the front desk, I mentioned this and also mentioned what the purpose of online check-in is if nothing is prepared and/or delivered prior to our arrival. The gentleman apologized and he said he'd take care of the request. The rest of the stay was uneventful and we were glad that we were not placed on a floor with the Model UN kids. Those kids incessantly pressed the up/down elevator call buttons for every bank of elevators on the 4th flr just to simply ask the elevator occupants if we'd want to play cards with them. Annoying, but tolerable. Also, by turning off the key card access for the Executive Floor elevators, these kids were roaming the hotel with no purpose but to explore. It wasn't until I asked a security guard to address these kids on the 4th flr to stop pressing the call buttons did the same guard decide to reactivate key card access at 9:30 at night! Room was excellent, breakfast buffet at 720 Restaurant was great for my wife and myself, but not as friendly for our children (expressed to Robert in Guest Services). Apps from Kitty O'Sheas were fantastic. Will stay again as we have for the past 14 years."
"Stayed at this hotel for one night on a business trip to Chicago. The location is right across the street from Millennium park in the Loop District. The Blue line train takes you from O'hare to downtown Chicago, within walking distance of this hotel of $5. I couldn't believe how cheap and convenient it was to get here from the airport. The Hotel is clearly an older hotel that once was a lavishly appointed space in a time gone by. Still, the place is clean, the rooms are more than adequate, the service friendly and accommodation, and the price was great. I was able to walk everywhere I wanted to go for business and entertainment at night, and still enjoy a drink at the comfortable bar at the end of the night.


Room Tip: I got a city view, which was nothing, but I didnt care about this.

"Check in was a nightmare, four staff for check in on a Saturday,WHY ? People were waiting in line for at least 45 mins if not longer. We were third in line and our wait was 35 mins. You should be ashamed of yourselves to treat guests this why. In the room one bar of soap for sink and shower, no nose tissue, no coffee maker. In lower end hotels they provide coffee makers so the guests can relax and feel comfortable. Our experience was not very favorable. The last time we were at this Hilton ( quite numbers years ago,) it was wonderful, can't say that now. PS, Your parking rates are outrageous."
"Stayed one night. Usually don't stay at 5 star branded establishment, but the rate was competitive.However reception was pu$hy for a upgrade (lake view).Apart from receptionist, all staff were helpful and courteous. Great inexpensive luggage storage on check out I required.Room had great water pressure in shower. Wrought iron heavy office swivel chair hazard to catching your fingers.Welcome screen with hotel amenities etc...not easy to understand.No free WIFI, which was a huge disappointment. Comfortable enough. Room service seemed very pricey."
"My family plans a Sat. night stay every year to the Hilton to downtown Chicago, visit with Santa, the kids go swimming at the pool and the adults sit sit around the spacious pool area and visit and take pictures galore. We go to dinner, take the kids on a ""El"" ride singing christmas carols and go to Melineeuim park for ice skating! It is always a great trip and the Hilton is the only place we will stay at. The hotel is beautiful with a huge beautiful tree in the foyer, decorations everywhere. We had ten rooms and at check-in ""Chris"" accommodated our entire family to be on the same floor (all under different last names). All of us were arriving at differnt times, but Chris put a note on the other reservations and everyone was on the same floor & most in the same area! This hotel is very special, try it and you will see what I mean!"
"My wife and I stayed here by mistake thinking we were booking into a Hilton just off the Magnificent Mile when in fact it's a 10 minute ride by bus to the Magnificent Mile. Our initial disappointment turned into joy once we were inside the hotel. It is magnificent. When it was built in the early 1920s it was the world's largest hotel with all mod cons. It has hosted every US President since it was built along with Presidents, Kings and Queens from around the world and other luminaries such as Winston Churchill and Aristotle Onassis. Make time to visit the in-hotel museum as well as the conference areas to see the artworks. The hotel is fully self-contained with everything most guests would want, including the irish pub, Kitty O'Shea's - definitely worth a visit.


Room Tip: Ask for a high floor twin room with two bathrooms on an Executive Floor overlooking the lake.

"We chose this hotel for it's nearness to the museum complex for a long weekend with our boys. The interior when you walk in is breathtaking. But this place was so full of conference goers, that it was quickly irritating. Over the four days we were there, it was constantly crowded and difficult to get through and out the door. We were able to eat at the main restaurant a couple of times, and it was very good. But other times we were unable to even eat there. Breakfast, for example, was impossible. The lines were so long with convention people, that we had to leave and walk down the street to the Best Western. The Irish bar was always completely full when we tried to go there. Our room was small, but had an incredible view of the lake, museums, and Navy pier. The walls were paper thin, we could hear the conversations our neighbors were having late at night. The heater seemed to be constantly on, no matter what temperature we set it at, and we ended up opening windows and turning the heater off completely. In late November. I realize that hotels make a lot of their money from hosting conferences, but other hotels 1. Include food, at least coffee and breakfast, and 2. Have a separate area for the throngs of people who attend, so that they aren't overwhelming the other guests. I would not stay here again."
"Enjoyed my stay at this grand hotel. I had a room on the 12th floor with a great view on the Lake: a magnificent sunrise woke me up every morning. The hotel shares some of its history by means of a quiz in the elevators.It is conveniently located close to the Park and several world class museums. Rooms are soundproof. Wifi is rock solid. Checking in and out was efficient and friendly.Even though the hotel is huge, management and personnel keep up a high standard. I will be back."
"We stayed here over Thanksgiving. We looked at our mattress and found a bug. We did put the bug into a bag and took a photo of it. Security came to our room, took the bug. They did have our things cleaned and moved us to a new room. It was however a huge inconvience. They called me a week later to tell me the bug had been identified and the good news they said was it was not a bed bug but a flea. Well I'm happy it's not a bedbug I'm not excited about fleas either! Also some rooms are renovated and some are not. When we first checked in we were given a older room, if you want a remodeled room it's $40 additional per night. We did pay for the ""upgrade"" but unfortunately the ""upgraded"" room was the room with fleas. Overall the staff was rude and difficult. I would never stay here again! There are so many options in downtown Chicago, don't pick this one simply because it's $20-$40 less a night!"
"Snotty front desk employees, poorly lit rooms, and when a few items are left behind in the room, they are gone for good. Hilton hotels are the worst!! Stay at a Hyatt or Marriot over the Hilton Chicago. There in nothing luxurious or special about their service, rooms or food. It's overpriced for the value. The final straw was their ""finder's keepers"" unofficial policy regarding items left behind. DO NOT STAY HERE!!"
"This was the second time I attended a convention at this location. The hotel is huge and has plenty of space for sessions. Checking in and out was an easy and simple experience. The king bed room was very small, but that is to be expected in Chicago as space is costly in that city. The bathroom was small as well. The shower/tub was too narrow (I am tall and thin by the way) and since the inner shower curtain was dingy at the bottom, I didn't want to chance touching it. The heat was not working when we got there, so I had to call to have it checked out. It took two calls, but the maintenance man fixed it and there were no problems after that. We could hear people moving hangars in the closet of the room next to us and could hear the shower in the room on the opposite side. We also heard noise from the hallway and quite a bit of street noise. We were only on the 6th floor, so you may have less road noise in a higher up room. Sometimes the wait for elevators and the excessive crowding of people in them is unnerving during a convention, so you may want a lower floor to allow for taking the stairs. Please note this hotel is not close to shopping. You will need to walk a long distance or take a cab."
"I recently stayed at the Hilton Chicago on a business trip as I was attending a large convention that was taking place at McCormick Place Chicago. The location was very convenient to the convention center and the room was nice and quiet but nothing special. The lobby/bar area was really nice and the hotel does have a coffee shop which is always a plus. However, the breakfast in the restaurant was not great and in my opinion was significantly overpriced for what was available and the quality of the food. Overall, the Hilton Chicago is a nice hotel with a convenient location to the convention center and Solider Field. If you will be spending most of your time in other areas of the city the hotel may seem a bit out of the way.


Room Tip: Ask for a room near the elevator as each floor has many rooms and several hallways.

"Great little boutique hotel. Nice modern feel, great facilities. Very friendly and professional staff. Easy check in/out. Location is fantastic. Right off Michigan with great restaurants and sights nearby. Easy walk down to the waterfront. Plenty of shops around, trader joes and a mall a block away. A little drawback was the small elevators. Here for business and when our meetings got out quite a line for the elevators. 2 of them and they fit probably 5-6 adults max. Comfortable bed, nice furnishings, couldn't figure out how to dim the alarm clock, nice meeting rooms. Really well done hotel."
"We enjoyed our stay at this hotel mainly because of the friendly service and the quiet rooms. We were on the 7th floor away from the lift well. the concierge couldn't help us enough and on the last day a late check out with no extra cost wasn't a problem. The rooms are a little tired, but clean. Convenient to all activities and very close to eataly! Bonus was the tea/coffee making facilities.


Room Tip: 7th floor and above

"My girlfriend and I stayed at the James hotel to celebrate our two year anniversary. Upon arrival we were greeted by the valet. Who was very courteous. They unloaded our bags for us. Upon check in, we were told we got an upgraded room. The room had a projector in it... Best upgrade ever. The room was very spacious. Beds were comfy! The shower had amazing water pressure. Every time we left the building the staff made it a point to make sure we enjoyed Chicago, suggesting places to eat and see. Absolutely blown away by the service of this hotel. Would stay again."
"We stayed here while bringing our kids to the city for a few days on spring break. Location was perfect and I was really impressed with the people. The levels of service were excellent. Very friendly, very helpful. I can't say that enough. The rooms were definitely on the modern edge, and our room had a cool view of the skyline. The only real issue we ran across was the thermostat. We tend to like our rooms cooler, and it got on the warm side in there no matter what we set the thermo for. Not worth complaining for, but it was a minor annoyance. Other than that, and what we felt was the salty valet charge ($65), this was a great stay. We will be back, probably without the kids."
"The James tries very hard to be a hip hotel. Things such as a more plain and modern interior, 325 ml bottles of liquor (for a commensurate price) in the minibar, a shower curtain in place of a door for the hanging closet, gluten free shampoo (!), a sliding bathroom door with frosted port hole window in place of a door, and a flat, wide bathroom sink (not as functional for draining the shaving cream) all add to the feel of the hotel. It was very comfortable, with excellent service. If you like this type of style, you will like this hotel. Good location for River North and Michigan Avenue."
"So the holiday inn is down the street and they have a complimentary breakfast.With that being said, the james is a decent. Comfy beds and clean. Anywhere you stay in that area is going to be a little noisy because Chicago Fire is nearby.We checked out both the studio and the loft. So the loft faces other rooms within the same building plus air conditioners. The studios are a tad smaller and face the street. The staff is nice. They have umbrellas to borrow. They have a complimentary car which is scheduled on a first come first serve basis. We used it just to go to other points within the city. They do not travel to he airport. We used uber for transport to the airport. The hotel had a coupon which saved me $20. So from the hotel to mdw, it was about$1.67 after applying the coupon."
"We stayed for 4 nights over the Easter Weekend and it exceeded our expectations. We were given a complimentary upgrade to an apartment and it was just incredible, a comfortable King size bed, a living room with a couch separate sitting/dining area, wet bar, large bathroom with a walk in shower. The service was fantastic, yet unobtrusive. Incredible location within minutes walk to shopping, tourist attractions and entertainment districts such as the rush village and with a short walk to Grand and State L train station on the Red Line. We'd stay again for sure."
"I stayed at this hotel on a business trip for four days. Hotel was convenient to shopping and restaurants. Christine made sure that I had a comfortable and spacious room and upon check out gave me her business card for future visit requests. Hotel and room were very clean. The bellman/doorman service was superior. Special thanks to Bernie, Jose and especially Lucas who always made sure I had ice when I walked back into the hotel. He also provided me with a nice brush and comb set when I asked where I could buy one:-) Overall customer service was outstanding!"
"We pricelined this hotel for the quality and location, so we didn't choose it. But we are glad it was given to us and would definitely stay there again. Check-in was easy, and we got to enjoy some interesting artwork in the lobby area. We were given a studio. The room was beautiful, if you like modern artsy decor. The light fixtures were all different, but they went well together. Honestly, it was the most interesting use of lighting I've ever seen in a hotel. My fiance and I actually spent a moment checking all the switches and dimmers. Same for the furniture. I absolutely loved the wooden end table. Bed was comfy. Bathroom had an interesting sliding door. The bathroom also had sulfate / paraben / silicone free toiletries. As a curly girl, I always pack my own stuff, but this is one of the only hotels that actually had nice toiletries I could use. Nice big bathrobes too.There was also a wet bar. We didn't use the fancy booze, but apparently if you want to pay for it, a bartender will come to your room and make you a drink. There is a minifridge full of stuff that we didn't try.The service was really nice - all employees were the right amount of friendly. I mentioned that we had just gotten engaged (it was true!), and when we came back to our room in the evening, there was a bottle of Martini & Rossi Asti on ice waiting for us. It came with a card congratulating us, which I thought was so sweet. Bartender was able to recommend good beers to us, and let's not forgot that many hotel bars don't even have interesting craft beer. It had a nice relaxed vibe, which was a nice way to finish out the evening.Check-out was late - 3pm, same as check-in. The later check-out was really convenient for my fiance and me, since we'd had a late night! Really, it was all of these little things added up, nice little touches and luxuries that you just don't expect to have at most hotels. I'm so glad that we ended up with the James for such a special weekend; I have a feeling it's going to become our regular Chicago hotel."
"My room was shaped like Oklahoma with a couch and giant size TV in the panhandle, meaning I was so close to the screen it felt like an IMAX. Lighting is so moody I was glad I'd packed my night vision goggles. (Business trip. Don't ask what business I'm in).There is a well stocked minibar and Pizza Uno delivers there, so I ordered their smallest pizza pie and lived off it for three days, plus another two purely running down the fat reserves it stored around my heart. Deelicious. I think it's the only hotel they deliver to, presumably because their delivery people collapse under the weight of pizza goodness otherwise. And the soaps are nice. Something fancy, I expect. They removed all the evidence off my skin. Like I said, business trip."
"We stayed at The James on our first visit to Chicago and the location of the hotel was perfect! When we checked in, the staff congratulated us on our recent wedding and upgraded us to a beautiful apartment corner suite! The room was huge with a very clean and modern fitout. The doormen were also very knowledgeable on good restaurants in the area and directions. We will definitely go back! Amazing experience!"

Centrally located one block off Michigan Avenue. Friendly and attentive staff. Easy check-in. We arrived early in the morning and our room was not ready - not a problem. The valet parking and the fact they held our bags for us made it easy and convenient. Also at check out they held our bags so we could enjoy the day in the city. Would definitely recommend. Very affordable for a high quality hotel.
"You'd be hard pressed to find a hotel that does a better job of welcoming and taking care of its guests. From registration to housekeeping to the restaurant you're greeted with a smile and a helpful individual. Equally, the space and rooms have a contemporary, clean and comfortable style that is attractive and relaxing. We had a king loft which was incredibly spacious and nicely designed - and heartily recommended. We were two friends traveling together and the space gave us each our own sleeping areas on comfy beds. Loved the gym which is very well equipped for a hotel of this size, and the Steakhouse was a wonderful bonus as the inhouse restaurant (even though I don't eat beef). My buddy had the 55-day steak and said it was delicious. I tried the king crab legs as an entree at the suggestion of the waiter and they were terrific. Add an unbeatable location in River North and you got all the hallmarks of a winner. Will definitely stay here again when I'm back in Chicago."
"The James Chicago has a fantastic location in River North Chicago, only a block from Michigan Avenue, a few blocks from the red line, a half mile walk from the loop, and easy to get to and from if driving. We booked the Loft Room on a special with the intent that we'd spend more time than usual in the room and we weren't disappointed. The private media room was comfortable and nice. Easy to recommend, especially if available at a discount.

"We checked in at about 5AM, they weren't going to let us check-in early originally unless we paid an early check-in fee for $200.00, not honoring what they had told us two weeks prior on the phone. We spoke with a supervisor the next day and they were able to reverse the early check-in fee. We asked for upgrade options when we checked-in too and would have gladly paid any extra charges, but the Front Desk Agent wasn't very helpful in offering suggestions. We enjoyed our stay, and thought the beds were comfortable."
"I reserved through Hotwire and will admit when my hotel was shown and it was The James, initially I was disappointed because I had never heard of it and from looking at the pictures it didn't seem as ""flashy"" as most boutique hotels are. However, I am so happy that I was able to stay at The James. I arrived early in Chicago and went straight to the hotel before heading to the conference I was attending. When I walked in I explained I knew it was well before check-in but just wanted to store my luggage, the front desk told me it was not a problem at all that I was early and that it was possible to check in early. The early check in made all the difference! Catching a 6AM flight into Chicago and then being able to nap and refresh before going to an all day conference was exceptional. I had called before arriving in Chicago to ask that my room by a king size bed rather than double and I was told if they were available my preference would be honored. Unfortunately, there weren't any basic rooms with king size beds but I was offered an upgrade for an extremely reasonable additional fee. The staff at The James always has a smile and were more than willing to help. They try to accommodate you in anyway possible, they truly just want to make sure you have an exceptional stay. The hotel is conventionally to all attractions and a quick walk to the L station. They also are right across the street from a Starbucks and Trader Joes!"
"I have stayed at the James quiet a few times over the past few years. Each visit has been a nice one. The bright and modern lobby greets you following a warm and attentive welcome from the doormen. The front desk is always manned by a fashionable but bright and friendly young professional with a fast and easy check in. Requests for a room in a quiet location have always been gladly accommodated. Both the suites and regular rooms are tastefully decorated and impeccably clean. Decor is modern yet comfortable. A perfect blend. Beds are quite inviting for a restful sleep. I have always found this hotel to be quiet and free from a lot of hall noise and sounds from the next room, even when fully booked. Being a light sleeper, I truly appreciate that aspect of this and any hotel. For business travelers there is an abundance of outlets with tables in the suites to work. A recent stay found me in a double bedded room which was quite roomy and offering a cool alcove with a work desk. Bathrooms are standard but again always spotless with plenty of bath and hand towels ( one area some hotels skimp on).The James offers a very nice boutique hotel experience for any visitor with a great location near Michigan Ave and many restaurants. Enjoy your stay!"
"The James is conveniently located within walking distance of most attractions in the Magnificent Mile. Many restaurants, bars, and shops around the hotel. Chicago river only four blocks away and lake Michigan fifteen mins walk. Treader Joe's is right across the street if you decide to purchase your own snack.Rooms have beautiful interior design. Clean and spacious. Beds and pillows are super comfortable. Sleep quality is good if you ignore the ambulance/police/firefighter's siren passing by every hour! Windows are quite large and rooms get plenty of natural light during the day. Rooms are equipped with a mini refrigerator fully loaded with water bottles, beer, and non-alcoholic beverages, a mini bar with snacks, a water boiler, tea bags, and instant coffee powder. Wifi is complementary; fast during the day and slow in the late afternoons and evenings. Lobby staff are very attentive. Concierge is knowledgable about restaurants and bars in that neigborhood. Even though we didn't use the gym or spa but we checked out the basement and the gym looked well equipped. I wish they had a pool but I think most hotels in that area don't have one."
"Location was great, walking distance to the Magnificent Mile. Hotel staff were awesome, very friendly and helpful. Jamie & Jessica made our 30th Anniversary a special one! Breakfast in the restaurant was very enjoyable. The room was very cozy and clean, a little small! Very comfortable bed! A nice place to stay and visit the city. The housekeeping often not mentioned in these reviews also did a great job!"
"Great location, friendly staff.The front desk was easily accessible with short wait times.The staff at the door was very helpful.Rooms were also spacious and clean.I stayed in the King loft suite with two other people.The bed was very comfortable.The bathroom was also very clean.Only downside was that the speaker docs all used the old iphone connector.It turned out the TV had smart TV so I was able to just link my youtube and listen to music that way."
"I stayed at this hotel for a week for business, it's right in downtown and convenient to all the clients I had to visit. The hotel is contemporary, but not too modern - a good medium, clean and nice. The bed is extremely comfortable. I typically don't sleep well in hotels but this made it very easy and relaxing. I actually wonder if they sell their pillows because I would definitely buy some. The room service is so nice, the food is really great. The downstairs restaurant is one of the best steakhouses in Chicago so that's a good topping to the cake. To be honest, the room service workers and the door men are much nicer than the people at the front desk. Everyone is pleasant, but the workers that have to work for tips put the front desk to shame. They should try switching up the jobs. All in all, the hotel is very nice and very accommodating and very comfortable. I visit Chicago often so I will definitely be returning here."

"Facilities are impeccable. Rooms extremely nice, clean, and well-appointed. But what set apart the James from other group business travel experiences I have had was their personal touch. From the valet parking to the front desk personnel to the concierge services, we found the attention to detail and courteous-yet-not-obnoxious service from the James to be outstanding.

"Really good looking interiors, contemporary furnishings in room, king-size bed with fluffy white comforter wrapped in white sheets--for cleanliness, full bar, strong hot shower, lovely service all around (front desk, doormen, valets, room service), great downtown location, around the corner from Eataly Restaurant complex AND five minute drive to the Navy Pier. Would definitely stay here again.
Only cons: Electronics!...

"I first need to stress how wonderful the concierge was at The James. From check-in to beyond check-out when we came back to the hotel to pick up our luggage the staff was incredible. I could write 4-5 examples of above-and-beyond things, but see for yourself. The room was nicely sized, great bed, awesome bathroom amenities. The location, one block from Michigan Avenue, made for a perfect central walking point to all things."
"We held our business conference at The James and it turned out perfectly.The service in conference and at the hotel were stellar, and the food was very good.The rooms are fun and the bar is one of the best stocked ones I have ever seen. The great thing is there is a Trader Joe's right in front of the hotel and with low wine prices and great snacks you probably wont use the mini bar. Shopping next door, Sushi place in front, and the lake not far this definitely is high on my recommendations for Quality Vs. price.This boutique hotel is worth a visit.


Room Tip: Try to go as high as you can to avoid the street noise.

"My husband and I stayed at The James Chicago on our 3 night 4 day trip in September . It was our first time in this city and we really wanted to stay in a central hotel . We couldn't have picked a better location . The hotel is located right off Michigan Avenue and is in the perfect spot with close proximity to all the restaurants , bars and shops. We were able to walk to all of our tourist locations and also enjoy dining at great restaurants . The hotel staff are very friendly and helpful . They also have a great gym . I would definitely stay here again on my next visit ."
We chose the James for our 4 day stay in Chicago on the basis of reviews on the site and were delighted with our choice. I would sum up The James by saying it is compact (by US standards) and with all necessary facilities and nice rooms and a very good restaurant (David Burke's steak house) and well situated for big-time shopping but what makes it stand out is the quality of the service and its personal nature. It made it a real pleasure to stay there. The front of house team are exceptionally good - especially the concierge desk of Bill and Laurelin. They were both happy to ensure we got the trips we wanted and the advice we needed.
"Lovely hotel, right in the middle of town. We stayed for the marathon, and its convenient for the start and finish. Rooms spotlessly clean, very friendly and helpful staff.Only downside was the restaurant was perpetually booked out, and the prices are 5 star, but all in all, worth a stay.Very comprehensive mini bar and snack list, which even included a nice bottle of red wine, pain killers, lots of snacks and an intimacy kit, I'll leave you to guess...."
"My wife and I just returned from mid-week 25th anniversary getaway to Chicago. We picked The James because of its central location to shopping, dining and attractions. The staff at the James was outstanding - they went out of their way to make our anniversary special. Laurelin (the concierge) booked at great last minute anniversary dinner at Sepia and then had champagne and raspberry truffles waiting in our room for our return. It was a very special treat, she even told the restaurant it was our anniversary.We booked a king room with breakfast included. The room was very nice, modern decor, comfortable bed, functional bathroom with great hot water / pressure. We had great drinks in the bar upon arrival (a little pricey) and breakfast in the morning in the restaurant. Breakfast was very enjoyable - the bill was a bit more then the coupon was worth but it was worth it. The lobby staff was very helpful with information and suggestions. Something I doubt most people recognize is the hotel will give you a ride to local destinations when the SUV is available. It was great to step out the door into a car to get a ride to dinner and the train station. The driver was very friendly and informative. Overall we had a great trip to the James. We will be back.

"We stayed four nights at the James after a three week roadtrip and, boy, was this the perfect way to end that vacation. Staff was friendly, courteous and very helpful, the room was very nice and clean and the hotel was small enough to feel personal and convivial. A unique and personal experience. Location was also great, just off the Magnificent Mile. The only downside was the automatic minibar where if you moved something, they'd charge your account. Bad for someone like me who likes to bring their own (craft) beer to the hotel..."
"Reserved a King Suite and found it to be disappointingly Spartan and as if somewhat had raced to get the suite clean. Lampshades were tilted, picture frames askew and a general tiredness to the furnishings. Gone the entire next day, came back to a room that had not been cleaned. When I called on the ONE phone that worked in the room, the individual explained rather curtly that, '' . . . housekeeping starts on the lower floors.'' When there was no response from me, she asked, . . ""Do you need someone to come up there now?"" I requested that someone just bring some fresh towels. The gentleman who came to the door a few minutes later was very apologetic, towels in hand, and asked if there was anything else that could be done. The remainder of the stay was uneventful, staff were very friendly and the room was cleaned. Went to the restaurant on two mornings, food ok, service polite but very slow. So if you're in a hurry, better go some place else.

"I couldn't have been happier with a hotel experience than the one I just had with The James in Chicago. The staff was notably friendly, helpful and accommodating, and extremely knowledgeable about local attractions, dining, and transportation (every food recommendation was excellent and they were great at picking good places with specific price restrictions).
The room itself was nicely made...

"The James is an interesting property in a city that's famous for design. Extensive and classy renovation but at times form seems to trump function. Like why have ice buckets when there are no ice machines? Or chairs that may look stylish but are seriously uncomfortable. (Chairs inbthe conference rooms are only slightly better, with low backs and very little padding that make forbade long day.)On the other hand the service is impeccable. They seemed happy to deliver ice (I later found out that they do have ice on some floors-like the 6th--in insulated chests, but that's apparently a secret), as well as memory foam pillows, a very nice touch. All the staff is interacted with were both friendly and helpful. And the location is great."
"I enjoyed our stay at this hotel. It wasn't perfect, but the bed was super-comfortable and the staff was very responsive to any issue we brought up, as well as friendly. Two complaints-- a smell (likely of cleaning chemicals) upon entering the room and no vegan items on the restaurant and room service menus (something that doesn't matter to everyone but does to me), but the location is great and the bathroom very nice. On the whole, I would gladly go back."
"This was our first time staying at The James Hotel. We were very impressed with the professionalism of the staff and cleanliness of the rooms. The hotel is located just off the Magnificent Mile, close to both upscale and believe it or not, outlet shopping. Lots of restaurants within walking distance, everything from ultra expensive to McDonald's. The decor is contemporary and rooms very comfortable, with a small refrigerator, coffee pot and snacks for purchase. The beds are heavenly! Best night's sleep I've had in a long time. Check-in and check-out time is 2:00 pm, which made it nice on both the day we arrived and the day we left. All in all, a great place to stay."
"I am in Chicago fairly often and have stayed at The James regularly since first discovering it. The understated elegance of the place has always impressed me. It's not flashy but everything is well designed and extremely comfortable. Last time I was there I forgot my my keys in my room on departure, and they were found for me and shipped back more or less instantly by the concierge Laurelin Hefter. Just cemented their reputation as my favourite hotel in Chicago."
"The James Hotel Chicago is the Best all-around hotel in Chicago! The location can't be beat - great restaurants and bars nearby, shopping on the Mag Mile, close to public transportation. But what really makes this hotel the best is their staff and the service they provide. Their staff has always been friendly, even when I've booked a room through a travel website rather than directly with them. They're always ready to make your stay better than expected, whether giving recommendations on places to go, making your room more comfortable, or taking you to your destination in their courtesy car. The James staff is truly committed to exceptional customer service. I'm already planning my next stay!"
"I just stayed at The James for a girls weekend and it was great. I do not think you could be in a better location! We walked everywhere and did not need a taxi at all! They have bikes, but you must reserve ahead of time. The concierge is very helpful as well. I had read a review on TripAdvisor that this was a fantastic location and it is!!!The room was nice, the service was great and the location was perfect."
"Thanks to all staff at The James for making our first stay in Chicago so pleasant. The king room has all that is required for a short or not so short stay and our reservations about lack of storage or floor space were unfounded. Clear description of the hotel and amenities when we arrived. We didn't use the concierge service or complementary vehicle so can't comment further. Room servicing staff were very efficient and managed to work round our clutter. Only regret is we left a visit to Jimmy until our last night. Having visited several other cocktail locations we were not hopeful of a 'comfortable' experience as we tend to double the average age within. From the time we parted the beads at the entrance it felt like we were at home. Justin and his elegant co-host welcomed us like kin and we spent an all too brief period engaged in convivial chat whilst enjoying some pretty impressive alchemy from behind the bar. Thank you Justin, you are a credit to this establishment and meeting you was one of the highlights of our trip.

"I cannot say enough good things about the staff at The James. The bellman who carried my bag in from the taxi glanced at the luggage tag so he could call me by name. Too bad for him that I share my bag with my spouse and he picked the wrong name to call me, but it was a treat to get that attention to detail and we had something to chuckle about all weekend whenever we saw each other. The food service staff at the events we were at were also friendly and helpful. Front desk staff was efficient as well. My only complaint was that the lighting in the rooms could have been better. The beds were comfy. The location is great - close to everything. I would stay here again."
"I had a double room for seven nights. The finishes are worn and this particular room felt a little like a dorm room. Shower didn't drain, toilet required multiple flushes. Ceiling had been patched and painted with different shade of white. Art above toilet (of all places) had damaged frame and looked like it was covering peeling paint. Entertainment center had soot on it as if a candle had been burned. Odd and mismatched furniture was positioned throughout. Sheets were soft, pillows comfy, and free filtered water each day was greatly appreciated. Hallway and elevator surfaces were damaged and need repair. Room service was promoted as an extension of their restaurant but the quality was mediocre. Concierge and bell hops were excellent."
"I enjoy boutique hotels and was rather disappointed with The James. Let's start with the good. I found it to be a convenient location, 1 mile walk from Art Institute and very close to the beaches and lake shore walks. It is around the block from Eataly, which was hands down one of the best culinary experiences of my life (it's a must). The door men were wonderful as were the young men at the front desk. I truly appreciated the fresh, cold water available at the front desk (I explored the city almost entirely by foot, so the water was much needed). The AC in the room worked extremely well. We like it cold. The not so good - the unconventional art in the lobby is very disjointed. With no theme connecting the decor it feels like an odd space that you don't want to spend much time in. It's as if someone said, well these are all strange things to display so it will look cool. But it doesn't. Concierge seemed too busy to assist me, wasn't welcoming or hospitable. Elevators are very slow. The couch in the room was for looks only, it was too uncomfortable to sit on. There was only one night stand for the bed. Awkward layout made it a not-so-comfortable room. Not the worst place but I will stay elsewhere next time I visit Chicago."
"We held our wedding reception here 4 years ago, and returned for our 4th anniversary for a night's stay. Everything was as we remembered it, though they now carry another toiletry provider (used to be Kiehl's products, it is now something else. The products weren't quite as good, but they were still very nice). The hotel overall is fantastic, everything is meticulously maintained and the staff make an amazing effort to ensure the comfort of their guests. We dined at David Burke for dinner, since the kitchen catered our wedding reception. The steak was even better than we remembered it, and our server was amazing. It was a GREAT experience, and we can't wait to come back again another year to celebrate. Can't recommend The James enough."
"Staying in deluxe room as complained about standard room due to outlook, small size and darkness.
Happily upgraded, but honestly not much different.

"Stayed for 3 nights recently. Great location. Did not get to try the restaurant but sat at bar two nights and wished we had been able to dine, too. Bar tenders very accommodating to our requests and remembered our previous night's orders. Rooms, service and cleanliness were top notch all the way around. Laurelin Hefter, the concierge, was about as good as you can get. She was very helpful and patient with all of our requests for info. Will definitely stay there on our next trip to Chicago."
"Stayed here 1 night mid-week in August.Room was very nice. Very large by Chicago standards.Bathroom was good. Shower was average with good water pressure. Bed was extremely comfortable.Gym was looks well equipped but of the ~4-5 treadmills, one didn't work. TV's didn't work on any of the others.Evening concierge was not helpful. Asked for directions to a nearby restaurant and she pointed. No map, no attempt to look up directions.Day concierge was extremely helpful on the phone. Recommended a great place for breakfast and laid out several options.Overall, a great value and location but service was average."
"This was the second time that I stayed at The James Hotel. It's clean, well-located, and has friendly, educated and helpful staff.The toiletries are great. Instead if individual toiletry samples, they have large bottles installed in the shower, which I love because they use less plastic (I am all for this type of eco-friendly). The bar soap is also GREAT. It had a natural peppermint smell. After several days traveling, I needed my nails done. They recommended ""Pen Perfect,"" which did a meticulous job, and had me out in time for dinner. Note: Pen Perfect has moved to a new location at 161 East Erie.Valet staff were fantastic and very efficient. Restaurant for breakfast was good. Order any toast and try the jams. Delicious. Breakfast is not included in the room, but if you can get a table by the windows, it's a good location for a quick bite or a breakfast meeting. The James is walking distance from many restaurants and nightlife. I would recommend dinner at the ""Purple Pig."" I would stay again, and would recommend this hotel."
"I stayed at the James Hotel Aug 6-8. The hotel was able to provide an early check in with 15 minutes of my arrival. The hotel is of the minimal persuasion, but that is of my liking. My room was on the 8th floor away from the elevators. I was able to sleep restfully each evening. Complimentary newspapers (Wall Street Journal, USA Today and Chicago Tribune) were available each day. The Steakhouse is on the expensive side within the restaurant, but the location is outstanding being one block off of the Magnificent Mile. Complementary rides within the CBD are available through the front desk. Bicycles are available to use as we'll complementary. Water (triple filtered) is available in your room (also complementary). I was pleased the hotel as a 2:00 pm check out, yes 2:00 pm! This was greet to wrap up a noon conference then return to the hotel to check off. The front desk was very helpful. Taxis ready if you need them. I would recommend this hotel!"
"Stayed at The James for a 3 day business trip. I felt like someone special from the time I got out of the taxi. When I had arrived, I realized that I lost my driver's license somewhere from the time I got on the plane until check-in when the associate asked me for ID. The concierge was very helpful in providing me with phone numbers to call to report lost and found. She was very sympathetic and was full of positive energy, that I didn't let it spoil the whole trip. The room was very comfortable and a little eclectic. Had a very hip ambiance. View was not so great as I was looking at the back of another building. Also, I was a little annoyed that I was charged $40 for damaged linen (fitted sheet only). Room rate was not bad because I got the conference rate.But, the hotel hosted the conference very well. And felt special even when checking out and hopping into the taxi to get back to the airport."
"My stay at the James, in June was made more pleasant by the friendly and efficient staff. The room was comfortable with good linens, towels and amenities. This is not a luxury hotel, but it is a welcoming and comfortable one. The location is perfect for shopping, museums, dining, etc. Laurelin Hefter, the concierge, was most helpful and the restaurant staff made dining a treat. I hope to return many times."
"This was my 1st time in Chicago and this hotel helped make it more than a work trip. Room was very clean and comfortable, staff was attentive, food was delicious! I would definitely stay here again. Our conference was held at the James and everything was well done. Our breakfasts and lunches were wonderful! And the one night we had dinner was magnificent! Order the filet. It was cooked to perfection!

"LocationThe James is in a perfect location! It is a block from Michigan Avenue which is perfect if you enjoy great shopping. It is close to everything! We walked everywhere, and we were always greeted by the friendliest doormen when we returned to the hotel. It is also very close to a subway entry, so even if we wanted to travel to places greater than walking distance, we could always walk a couple of blocks and go by subway. Hotel Awesome Awesome Awesome! When we first arrived we were greeted and checked in by James. He was extremely charming and helpful. We arrived early, so the hotel checked our bags in and held them for us as we went out for lunch and waited on our room. Luckily we had an entire day planned on arrival, and we didn't need to be checked in until later because our room wasn't available until 2pm. Checkout at this hotel is 2pm, so people stay much later than the average 11:00am checkout which makes it harder to get an early check in. As I stated though, we already had a lot planned for the day that we arrived so we didn't need our room early. This hotel is very popular, and it appears to always be booked, so if you need an early check in, you might not be able to get that with this hotel. The hotel is BEAUTIFUL. The rooms are very modern and chic! I felt like I was in a downtown loft, and this is what I loved about the room. We stayed in one of the loft rooms which was very spacious! There was a full bar, nice shower products, and the most comfortable bed I have ever slept in. Seriously. I slept like a newborn baby my entire trip! The hotel was booked, but it was still quiet. We weren't able to hear the people next to us or their TVs, music, etc. at any point during our stay. No pool :( At least I don't remember seeing one. Chicago has great beaches, so we really didn't need a pool at the hotel, but a pool would have been nice. The gym at this hotel is probably one of the best gyms we have seen in a hotel. It is large with plenty of free weights and plenty of cardio machines. On the one day that we planned to go to the bar at the hotel, we stopped by the room first to drop off our shopping bags and walked into a ""Happy Anniversary"" surprise. The James Hotel had provided us with a dessert and champagne, so we stayed in the room and enjoyed our champagne. Thank you James because I told him very briefly that we were celebrating our anniversary on check in, and he remembered! We really appreciate you James and the James hotel for such a great experience. The restaurant at the hotel looked very nice, but we are vegetarians and they didn't have many options, so we never ate there. It was always busy, and there are lounge areas outside the restaurant close to the bar, so there were always plenty of people around. Complimentary car within 2 miles of hotel. Now this is awesome! So my feet were killing me one day from shoes that I should have left at home, so we decided to take the complimentary car to dinner one night. Our driver was very safe and very nice. The car will take you to your destination (must be within 2 mile radius of the hotel), but I don't believe it will pick you up from destinations and return you to the hotel. Its a first come, first serve basis, and the car was always available because most people walk around downtown chicago. Like I said, we just needed it for one night :) We walked back to the hotel. There are also complimentary bikes that we didn't use, but just having that option is awesome. A lot of people bike around chicago through the city's Divvy system which cost $7 for 24 hours, but you can only use the bike in 30 minute intervals. The bikes at The James hotel can be used at any time, and you don't have to pay anything extra. Concierge is also available for any of your needs in the city. When we first arrived, we wanted a place to eat breakfast, so James sent us over to concierge and he was able to help us find a vegetarian friendly place. He printed us the menus for 3 different places so we could choose, and once we made our decision, he gave us walking directions. Thank you for this great service! Whenever we stay in Chicago, we will never ever ever choose a different hotel. This boutique hotel will go above and beyond your expectations! Crystal"
"This hotel is in the loop neighborhood in Chicago, with quick access to nearly everything imaginable by foot or rail. The rooms are comfortable and very nicely appointed with hip furnishings and colors. The bathroom has a wall mounted, lighted magnifying mirror and the lighting is on a dimmer to protect your eyes in the early morning. Toiletries were a fancy brand I'd never heard of, but the packaging indicated the company supports the Dress for Success program. The shower head was mounted high enough for a tall person to get completely under it. TV included three HBOs, and the mini fridge didn't have the annoying motion sensor some hotels do so you could actually store you own food/drinks in it. The HVAC is quiet, and the control is digital with multiple fan speeds, although you could not choose if the system was in heat/cool mode. Room service is insanely prompt and the food is delicious, but the fees were a bit absurd. My room did include a safe with a removable shelf that was large enough for my 15"" Macbook Pro with plenty of room on top for more. Complementary wine is served in the lobby from 5-6pm each day, and the staff was accommodating when I checked in just as it was closing by giving me a $10 gift certificate to the restaurant/bar. There is not much in the way of dresser drawers to unpack clothes. The only issue I ran into during my week stay was with the nearby train. It was loud and simply disrupted my sleep. Wifi is complementary for Kimpton Rewards members, users can sign up while in the hotel but it asked so many personal questions on a connection I simply wasn't sure was secure I didn't feel comfortable using it.


Room Tip: High floors on the NW corner of the building will have a fantastic, if partial, view.

"Whenever I stay at a Kimpton hotel, I wonder why I don't look for them in other places. This one (as they all are) was sleek, modern and comfortable. The room was a nice size. Wifi is free if you sign up for their rewards program (also free.) The bathroom amenities are nice. The yoga mat in the room and complimentary wine happy hour are great extras.This hotel is conveniently located. Service is friendly. They seemed a little overwhelmed by all the people at checkout but the woman behind the desk was quick. Nice job."
"I have not stayed in many Kimpton hotels, but I sure do like them when I do. The location of Hotel Monaco was perfect for my reason to be in Chicago, right inside the Loop. I loved the bathrobes and edgy furnishings. My room was very comfortable, and the desk was even bigger than usual. Two closets. Tiny vanity space in the bathroom, but suitable otherwise. No noise, no sounds almost at all. Very comfortable firm mattress with soft and downy pillows & linens. Extra lines in the closet! You have to order the coffee maker special to your room. While I feel that in-room coffee should be SOP, at least it is possible to get delivered in the room. Small but more than adequate fitness center. The restaurant closes at 10:00 p.m., but you can still get a salad or sandwich for room service. Breakfast was decent. Staff, truly friendly and helpful. Loads of everything in walking distance. My room had only a view of a brick wall, so not much light or enjoyment on that side of the hotel. get a room facing the street, that would be way better."
"Loved the location, within walking distance to everything we were doing. The staff was extremely helpful. Phylicia at the front desk helped us receive and transmit legal documents in a rushed situation without batting an eye. At the door, Kevin continually gave us good walking directions and made sure we had a taxi when we needed one. The room was lovely. We had one in the 11th floor facing the river. I sat in that window seat quite a bit, soaking in the view. The food served in the restaurant downstairs was also good and served quickly when we were in a rush."
"We had one night at the Hotel Monaco to enjoy a bit of Chicago after a week long stay and the McCormick Place Convention center while exhibiting for a large show. From the moment the cab pulled to the curb, the service was excellent. The room was very nice, clean and comfortable. The location is wonderful unless you are bothered by the sound of the El. It is within easy reach of any part of downtown. We missed the evening wine hour because we headed out to the burbs with a friend from the days when Chicago was home. This hotel was so pleasant, I just wished we had been able to stay longer.


Room Tip: You might ask for a room away from the El.

"We were very pleased with our choice of the Hotel Monaco. The location was excellent for our visit... right in the middle of downtown so a short walk up to the top of the Millennium Mile and a short walk down to the Art Institute and the theatres. There are great restaurants all over the place. The decor is unusual, a little glitzy, like you might imagine a hotel in Monaco to be. I appreciated the character of the furniture and had a little laugh over the animal print bathrobes. I don't like big, anonymous, chain hotels so this suited my tastes well. It is still a chain hotel, not a B&B, but it has the charm of a stand-alone. We had a ""river-view,"" which was a bit of a stretch but I am still glad that I paid the extra because that side of the hotel was VERY quiet. I imagine you might hear the very noisy train on the other side. Our view was actually of the gigantic Trump building, and a paved bridge, with a tiny little slice of river if you looked carefully, but you do have a lovely, open view of the city buildings. The window in our ""deluxe king"" was small, but the room was still bright and the window seat is awfully cute (though you need to be a bit flexible to clamber up onto it). The bed was SUPER comfortable and I don't think I have ever stayed in such a QUIET hotel... no noise from elevators, cleaning staff or other guests. We didn't use the restaurants, room service or the mini bar, but there is a 7/11 right across the street and a few breakfast places in easy walking distance. We also didn't take advantage of the free ""drink hour"" but it seemed very popular, with all the visitors we didn't hear appearing at that time. The staff at the front desk and the concierge were very friendly and helpful. I joined the loyalty programme before booking to access the free wifi... worth it and it was fast wifi. A great experience, great value for the money.

Green Features: There was no ""please save the earth by re-using the towels"" sign, surprisingly. I find those signs annoyingly hypocritical but, as an environmentalist, I did wonder at their absence. It seems that Chicago is intent on being environmentally friendly, so perhaps it is a given."
Just spent Saturday night at the Hotel Monaco. My wife and I were celebrating an anniversary and needed a little getaway. Check in was friendly and painless. We had one of the corner suites and it was perfect for us. Kimpton surprised us with a bottle of wine to celebrate our anniversary -- very nice touch. My wife loved the windows seats. Bed was great -- got a great night sleep. Was going to just find a coffee shop for breakfast but ended up grabbing a fine breakfast at the South Water Kitchen in the Hotel. My wife said we should get the exact same room every year -- I said why wait a year!
"Was in Chicago for business but decided to stay a few extra days and make the trip both business and pleasure. I am a bit particular; to my wife's shagrin. From arrival to departure the staff could not have been more professional and accommodating. They went out of their way in a sincere fashion to make our visit enjoyable. Doorman, frontdesk, bartender at lobby bar to waiter. All made our trip memorable. We have been to other Kimpton properties and always appreciate the treatment they extend to their guests. Thanks, Jack and Teri"
"We stayed at Hotel Monaco 3/26-3/28 with our family of 4. While we live in the Chicago suburbs it was a great location and base to explore the city. Highlights that made this hotel a unique experience is their special treatment of the kids. Upon arrival they were given cute welcome bags with some toys and crafts. They even brought a goldfish to our room for the duration of our stay. However, my favorite part about this hotel was the window seats. A great use of space in the room, and a really enjoyable place to read or just look out. Service was kind and helpful. I really cannot think of anything negative to say about this hotel and would gladly stay there again.

"Hotel Monaco Chicago location is extremely convenient as it is in the center of downtown with incredible views. Walking distance from wonderful restaurants and shops. The decoration of the hotel is modern and yet has a old world charm to it. Extreme high ceilings, beautiful curtains and carpets combine old charm with current trends. The restaurant in the lobby is wonderful with great choices. The hotel also had a happy hour with free wine that gathered guests and friends. The staff was extremely accommodating and warm. I will definitely be coming back.

"We've stayed at a bunch of hotels in the downtown area of Chicago, and the Monaco was one of those I had to look for things to complain about. All I could come up with was ""no coffee machine in the room"", then my wife pointed out that it was on the list of things I could request to have sent up. Wow. Great location, excellent service. They serve free coffee in the morning and have wine in the evening. Rooms are very nice, the hotel is a good size for the amount of elevators (you never wait minutes for an elevator). Overall, this is a great hotel.

"We had such a lovely stay here. Not only was the location perfect for everything that we wanted to do, the staff were friendly, welcoming and helpful. Sheila and Richard were extremely helpful in helping me to arrange a birthday surprise for my husband even before we arrived in the hotel. The room was spacious, clean and comfortable, offering a range of services and little additional touches. This was the best hotel stay I've had in a long time."
"The hotel is located in a perfect corner where the rive flows and a block from Michigan avenue which is the best to shop...It is clean, quiet, very comfortable, and above all, the rooms are funky.. I love the windows, the sill is a huge padded area where you can bring the bottle of wine and watch the outside world go by... Perfect romantic platform.I was here for New Year's plus one. We never left the room!!!Much recommended. Visit Macy's down the block on state street for some greats sales.It's a bit pricey but worth it.

"I visit the USA regularly for business. My company has a deal with Kimptons in most cities. However while some of them are lacking, the Monaco is my favourite one to stay in. All the staff are so friendly and helpful. The rooms are larger than usual. It's very central and much better than the sister hotel the Allegro. I am a woman traveller on my own, and here I feel completely safe, other locations are not the same. Great place"
"My husband and I arrived after a nine hour travel delay, arriving at Hotel Monaco at nearly midnight. We were greeted by a very friendly and helpful staff and quickly situated in our room.....And the room was amazing! Our 11th floor king room overlooked Trump tower and many of the architectural treasures of Chicago. The skyline from this vantage point is stunning.The facility itself was extremely comfortable---still want to know what kind of mattress they use(!), and the room was very quiet despite its busy downtown location. It was, perhaps, the best night's sleep I've had in a hotel....ever. This hotel is a little treasure. If, like us, you prefer smaller 'boutique' hotels, this is for you. It has all the amenities you'll need plus a convenient location---walking distance to major sights, attractions, restaurants, and shopping.Thank you, Hotel Monaco! We joined your Kimpton Rewards program, and we plan to stay with you again!

"OK, here's a tip: don't show up at a hotel at 9 a.m. when check-in doesn't start until sometime after lunch, like we did. That said, the Hotel Monaco staff was courteous and very helpful. My wife interrogated the concierge for what seemed like hours, and the guy loaded her with good information.The desk crews were always very attentive, and the place was spotless. Oddly enough, I never saw the housekeeping staff -- just the results of their work.Great views of the city, particularly if you get a higher floor room facing the river. In this case, the highest floor is 14 stories up, but from there, you can see the river, the House of Blues, Trump's place and other stuff. From here, it's an easy walk to Millennium Park to see The Bean or to shop on the Magnificent Mile.


Room Tip: Go for an upper floor facing the river.

"I stayed here at the beginning and end of a 4,000 mile road trip around the Midwest and Northwest in May 2014.It's a lovely hotel, well located within walking distance of Millennium Park and the awesome AIC. Staff were pleasant and helpful, the rooms were clean and well appointed. On the second visit I booked a riverfront room, which had a great window-snug overlooking the river. Definitely worth the additional cost. I'd be tempted to use the same hotel when I return to Chicago, which isn't something I usually do.


Room Tip: River view rooms are worth the extra - the window snugs are very nice!

"Each member of the staff I encountered provided exceptional hospitality, from the welcome I received at the front desk, the attentive restaurant service, the enthusiastic doorman, the pleasant wine hostess, zipping out at checkout even with some incidentals, and even a follow up from the manager. Great location, comfortable room, but it was the service that set this trip apart.

"We just left the Monaco hotel and were a bit unimpressed with our visit. All the staff that we encountered were extremely friendly and very helpful, especially the hotel Porters.Although our room was clean, it was nothing to write home about. Upon entering the room and inspecting the mini-fridge, there was a can of sprite missing already. Next, the toilet in the bathroom was not very secured to the floor and therefore it wobbled. We looked outside, not expecting a fantastic view, and were greeted with a rooftop featuring a dead pigeon that had been there for a while. Before we could fully unpack our belongings, a man who (we assume?) worked there knocked on our door and asked if he could come in and take a picture of the office chair. As he pulled out his smart phone and took a picture of the chair, he stated that they were in the process of updating some of the furniture in rooms. He then also peaked at the soap dish in the bathroom before leaving. This made us extremely uncomfortable. The next morning, at 8:45am, we were woke up to someone knocking on the door saying ""housekeeping"". I opened the door and the lady apologized and stated that she could come back later. At 10:30am, someone else came to the door and knocked from housekeeping. I opened the door again, slightly frustrated and a different lady apologized and stated that she could come back later. I told her to come back at noon when we had checked out. Upon leaving, one of the Porters held our bags so that we could enjoy the city without being weighed down. When we came back, the other Porter remembered us, asked how our night in the city was, opened the door for us, grabbed our bags and then asked if he could call a cab for us. Exceptional service.Overall, our stay was okay. I was glad that our room was clean and the staff was friendly, but all other aspects of our visit were sub par."
"I am a Kimpton fan. They find a grand (and often older) property and turn an interior design firm loose to enhance the original architecture and designs with new energy and flare. In the Monaco group this means that the feel is traditional, elegant but bright and fun. At Hotel Monaco Chicago, the location just off of North Michigan and in view of the river makes it an ideal location for walking and exploring; the park, the museum, food and of course the blues. For this visit, I used Karma points earned over the last year and was treated on arrival to an upgrade to a beautiful suite. The staff, as usual was ready at every contact to see what I might need. The restaurant was great at breakfast and for afternoon coffee.So, the Kimptons always make traveling a pleasure and this Chicago location gets it all right.

"Very nice location for Michigan Ave, Loop, or River North destinations. Walkable to Millenium Park and Art Institute- when its not too cold!. Nice rooms- we went for the goldfish companion for fun. Restaurant is fair but solid for bar drinks (very good bartender) and breakfast. Had to stay an extra night due to an ice storm in home city and was accommodated seamlessly. Wine and hot cider (spiked and non) happy hour. As with all Kimptons- a boutique fun feel that benefits from the chain's good taste and standards is without unwanted surprises. Next to the Virgin Hotel and seems a much hipper and lively property.Fine for couples, families and small pets.

"Love this hotel. Third time to stay there and I always enjoy it. I was in Chicago for a conference, but instead of staying at the conference hotel, I walked daily in the snow and cold weather to stay at the Monaco. That is how much I enjoy the hotel. Great people - friendly service - excellent location. I will definintely be back.

"Try to get a room above the 9th floor because its on a busy street also ask for a river view. Our room was so sweet it had two window seats the one was 6ft x 4ft the other was smaller but both with cushions and pillows. Friendly Staff and they worked with us on everything. Warning not every floor has a ice machine so when you leave your room take your ice bag so you can stop and get ice on your return and not have to go to the room to get your bag then to another floor.

"Just returned home from the BigTen tournament in Chicago. A friend had booked his room here,so I did as well.Very classy,boutique feel hotel. Smaller, but just right. Staff were very friendly. Room was awesome! Only suggestion would be to have a few bottles of water in the room,as there is no ice or beverages. The parking is a shock at $58 a day,but I understand that's the norm. Would definitely come back. Great location also. Will look for Kimpton hotels in the future."
"We stayed in a Riverview Mediterranean suite, not much expense to upgrade, but definitely worth the money. We had corner room with amazing views of the river on both walls. Better yet, we had so much room to spread out and sleep.There are extremely comfortable window seats that are the size of twin mattresses in the main bedroom and half the width in the sitting room. Easily, you could sleep 10-12 people. That brings me to the only downside... the bathroom. It felt very dated, with chips of fiberglass tub exposed. (Granted, it was the world's deepest tub-- almost like a swimming pool). However, the space would be better served with a more generous shower. This one was big enough for me, but feels like an RV shower size. Some cracks in the grout, but nothing that would stop me from booking again.Back to the positives... the service was exceptional, the room phenomenally clean, and noise was not excessive (street noise can be heard, but it's not worse than any other big city hotel). The staff even made up beds with a quick phone call. While you may expect housekeeping to do this automatically, you definitely don't expect them to set up beds in the window seats and have your kiddo's favorite stuffed animal waiting for them. VERY great job.The location was easily walkable to many main areas. A black Uber car service was $15 to John Hancock building/Water Tower theater.


Room Tip: Splurge for the Riverside Mediterranean suite... definitely worth it.

"I have to start by saying I am a huge Kimpton (and Hotel Monaco) fan. I try to stay at Kimpton's as much as possible when traveling and appreciate their unique, boutique style and great customer service.The Hotel Monaco in Chicago is very centrally located. I was there for an entire week on business, traveling solo and found it to be easy for me to walk to most places or quickly get a cab when necessary. The decor was very true to Monaco style - although maybe not quite as eclectic as other versions in Seattle or Portland. My room had a nice view and adorable window seat and was a nice size. I think my only complaint was that room service was...basically only edible at best. I got room service dinner I believe my first night there as I had arrived pretty late and it was really not good. Otherwise - great place to stay when traveling to Chicago! Also great rates!"
"I can't say enough about how much I love both the hotel itself and the staff at Hotel Monaco Chicago. The actual physical hotel is beautiful and the window seats in the rooms are a hit with the kids and the adults. I have had interaction with the manager, the desk staff and the concierge and I just can't express how pleasant and helpful they are. The doorman and the concierge really make my daughter feel special when we stay here, they are so sweet and really engage her in conversation. We visited the Monaco before school started after a difficult summer that included accident and injuries, I let the hotel know this was a special trip for us and they were so nice. Sent up a welcome basket and a card, love the people that work in this hotel!! We will be spending Easter with you this year.

"We stayed for a girls weekend. We contacted the concierge, Sheila Garg, before our trip and she was unbelievably helpful. She welcomed us upon arrival, added even more restaurant and site seeing options, and even sent a little treat up to our room. The front desk was very attentive and friendly. The evening happy hour is a nice little touch.This hotel is in a great location, steps from a Starbucks and an Irish Pub across the street.We were able to walk to great shopping and the Chicago Institute of Arts. Great stay!

"I have stayed at this lovely hotel many times and always found it to be a pleasure. The rooms are beautiful and well appointed. The meeting rooms and gym are great. But the customer service keeps me coming back. All the staff are friendly, personable and professional. And then there are the charming quirky touches like the goldfish! If you are looking for a place to stay with great access to Michigan Ave shopping, museums and Millenium Park this is a perfect location and you are a block and a half from the CTA Orange Line to travel other places in the city."
"The hotel is older and charming. The attached restaurant is great for Brunch, Lunch and Dinner. The Bar is lively.I liked this hotel for many reasons. It is a great bargain given the location and style of the hotel. Our room was plenty large and the bathroom were spacious as well. Many wonderful things to do in this great city.

"Just returned from a 5 night break at the Hotel Monaco and what a fantastic hotel it is! Rooms are spacious, clean and well decorated with all the amenities you need! The location of the hotel is extremely central for both downtown Chicago and the magnificent mile, with shops, restaurants, cafes and areas of interest on your doorstep. What makes this hotel even more special are the people that work there and the service they provide. We have stayed in other city/states in America at various hotels and the Hotel Monaco is by far the best we have experienced. And I will openly say I am not easily pleased! We would recommend this hotel in an instant! If we ever return to Chicago we wouldn't stay anywhere else! Well done for being brilliant hotel and thank you so much for making our trip even more special :)

"The Hotel Monaco is centrally located near the theater district, near Michigan Avenue shopping, and not far from the Art Institute. The Mediterranean Suite that we chose in the Chicago Wabash Street location are extremely comfortable and very well decorated. We had previously stayed at a Kimpton property in San Francisco across from Fisherman's Wharf called the Argonaut located at which was also really nice. The hotel staff was very friendly. Valet parking is a little pricey at $58 per night. We were in room 505 facing Wabash. The main drawback to our room location was the noise from the elevated train as it rounded a corner nearby. However, the noise was muted and didn't keep me awake. Another minor issue that I will mention is that I was presented with a $10 mini bar voucher upon check-in, but was then charged $9 the day after I checked out of the hotel for $9 of items used two days prior. I called from home, and was told that I will receive a refund, but the little things like this become a distraction from the experience.So, overall, the Monaco is highly recommended. Just be attentive to the location of the elevated train and the potential for errors with their mini-bar discount coupons."
"This is the 2nd Kimpton Hotel I have stayed at and will certainly stay here or look for another Kimpton Hotel in the future. The decor in the main reception area is beautiful and the rooms are extremely spacious, well designed and furnished to a high standard. The staff were helpful and friendly. The location in central Chicago is perfect for a weekend break or longer stay. Nearby shops and tourist attractions are just steps away. Lots of bars and restaurants within the vicinity too. A great place to stay and cannot wait to return.Super comfortable beds ensure a lovely nights sleep.

"We come to Chicago for sporting events, concerts, plays etc.etc. and have been staying at the Monaco for over 15 years. So needless to say, we like this place. Great rooms, great staff, great resturant/bar. And all right in the heart of the City. The majority of the things we do while in town either over night or for a long weekend are within walking distance from the Monaco. We have never been disappointed with the service, the rooms, the staff or any aspect of our visits. So if you are in town for business or pleasue make sure the Monaco is your hotel of choice. You won't be disappointed.And just a side note, two years ago we went to San Diego for business and stayed at the Kimpton Hotel downtown and with only the exception that the Pacific Ocean not Lake Michigan was a short walk from our hotel, you could not tell the difference in rooms, staff, resturant/bar and central location.

The Monaco in Chicago lived up to the high expectations I have come to have for Kimpton properties. Our room with 2 queen beds was spacious enough. The staff was attentive and prompt when we needed anything. We also very much enjoyed the evening wine reception in the lobby. On our last day we had a big group brunch at South Water Kitchen. The food was great and they had no problem accommodating our large group.
"Read reviews on TripAdvisor for Hotel Monaco while planning a weekend trip to Chicago. Loved the idea of the fish bowl and wine hour, so I booked a room. I was not dissapointed! The rooms are so cozy and clean. Most comfortable bed. Staff was so genuinely friendly!! Wine hour in their comfy lobby was a great way to relax and meet other guests. It's little added touches like this that makes a hotel stand out! Thank you Hotel Monaco for an amazing stay!"
"Just returned from a week in Chicago. The first half of the week was for work and in a ""work"" hotel. The second half was personal and we spent it at the Monaco.While the first hotel was fine - everything was okay there was nothing of actual note to make you remember the hotel.Then we moved to the Monaco and upon walking in it was a completely different world. The staff was friendly and helpful. The room was insanely cool -- especially the window seat! Never thought I'd be into it but it was nice to be able to sit there (with PLENTY of room for two) and look down at the river and watch Chicago go by for a bit.We went down to the wine hour and when we got back to our room there was a welcome amenity, sent up by Ericka Kouba that had a few local things to share with us since it was our first time in Chicago. Again, the little things that suddenly make the Monaco heads and tails from where we'd been earlier in the week.Throughout the week the various staff members we talked with were friendly, remembered us and always had a minute to talk.The final part that reaffirmed why we are dedicated Kimpton devotees was that the fan in our room went out the afternoon of the last day we were there. Things happen, machines break. We called and within minutes maintenance was in our room and checking it out. It took not time to determine that the fan wasn't going to come back to life -- 4 hours to repair. We were more than happy to hang tight knowing we'd have air soon enough and told management it wasn't an issue. The phone rang 10 minutes later and we were moved to a suite for the last night with apologies for the inconvenience! Talk about taking an unfortunate situation and not only making the best of it but making sure you have clientele that will come back again and again.Thanks to EVERYONE at the Monaco for a very memorable first visit to Chicago, maintenance (who was awesome and did get the a/c back up and running as we talked with him the next morning) and to Ericka Kouba for making sure we have a great visit. (Say Hi to ""Emily"" for me!)

"What a special place! Old world charm meets new world amenities. In looking for an upscaled, downtown Chicago hotel and wanted something convenient to all the major shops, eateries and the lake, I found it all here. My room wasn't available at check-in, so I changed in the hotel restroom, left my luggage with the valet and went for a run along Lake Shore. Upon return, my room was ready. It was clean, tastefully furnished, complete with the fun, eclectic Kimpton touches .. animal print robes, $10 raid the bar credit, etc. A few minutes after settling in, a knock on the door produced a porter who presented me with a bottle of wine and a fruit tray .. as an apology for not having my room ready upon my arrival. Now that's what I call service, considering I checked in before the posted check-in time! At 5 pm, the evening wine hour was met with many interesting guests and servers. Another interesting touch is that the wine steward changes. Could be the valet, the bellman, someone from reception or the back office. I enjoy getting to know the entire Kimpton staff. Speaking of staff .. every member was friendly, accommodating and greeted with a hello .. and how can I help you? The valet was, by far, my favorite, however. Always a friendly smile, an opened door and a ""thank you for staying with us .. how can I assist you?"" (This occurred every time I entered or left.) Made me feel like royalty, even when I came in dripping with sweat from a long run. I would recommend staying here for anyone.The only downside was the downtown noise and something going on in the floor above my room. The odd thing is I was staying on the top floor (and there's no banquet room, etc., above my room), so not sure what that was about?? Sounded like kids running amok in the middle of the night. For the light sleepers, I recommend ear plugs. Otherwise, it was a perfect stay at another Kimpton establishment!

The high quality hair dryer was awesome, and there was lovely soap and shampoos. The black out curtains were great, and I loved the height of the room, and how gorgeously it was decorated. Our linens were crisp and clean, the pillows and king bed were delightful. The hotel itself was centrally located. We were in town for marathon weekend, and the concierge was helpful with special breakfast options starting at 4am, and directions to the race. The selection of teas and coffees in the lounge in the morning were yummy, and the iced lemon and cucumber waters were a delicious afternoon option. I would stay at the Monaco again in a heartbeat.

"Hotel Monaco is a fantastic hotel; friendly staff, fantastic location great rooms (quiet despite the busy location), good modern gym facilities (loved the hula hoop), and wine time between 5 and 6 is a great idea (although we were only at the hotel during this time when we checked in. Complementary robes in the room were fun too; we had a zebra and cheetah.Only grumble would be that there are no do not disturb signs so the house keeping staff knock on the door in the morning, relatively early, between 8 and 9. We were on our way out each time so it was not a problem for us but if we had wanted to sleep in this would have been a little irritating."
"I booked this hotel from the road on the afternoon before i arrived. My choice was based on tripadvisor ratings and price.Upon arrival, i asked for a ""nice room"" (which i always do), and i got top floor with riverview. I think this is probably one of the best rooms possible. Direct view to Trump Tower and a little reclining area in the window. There was a bottle of champagne (most likely by mistake) in a cooler in the room so i called reception about this. They told me it was mine now... good start for a friday night.I asked for dinner options and got a few good recommendations, within walking distance.Next morning, i had to ship some goods with UPS and the concierge Sheila was extremely helpful and friendly with this.Altogether, i was very pleasantly surprised by the service and friendliness i got for the price, compared to other 4 star hotels in chicago. I will go back anytime and will recommend this hotel to all my friends.

"I've been pretty stingy with my 5 stars lately, but as I sat down to think about the 3 nights I spent at the Hotel Monaco recently and could not think of anything I would change.Was able to take the train in from O'Hare. $5 instead of $50 in a cab. Walk from the Clark/Lake station is several blocks, but no problem for me and my wife. Arrived around noon, but were able to check in to our river view king deluxe room. As Kimpton Kharma rewards members, were given a $10 voucher to 'raid the bar' either in the room or in the hotel restaurant. The prices in the room mini bar were actually quite reasonable even without the voucher. Also, free wi-fi with good speed for Kharma members.We had only booked for Thursday and Friday night but wanted to extend to Saturday. The front desk clerk who checked us in said she didn't have anything available at that moment, but to check back the next morning because people often cancel their reservations the day before. In the end, we not only were able to stay an extra night, we were able to keep our same room. (I was worried that there was going to be a hassle because we were charged a higher rate for the third night, but the desk clerk fixed this on checkout.)The room was large and comfortable. Wouldn't change anything there. We loved our view of ""beauty and the beast"" across the Chicago River -- the famous twin corn cob apartment buildings and the newer Trump International building. We actually used the window sitting area several times just to relax and people watch.The porters working out front were always very helpful and friendly.Love Chicago, and love this hotel. Can't wait to go back.

"Stayed at the Monaco Chicago 9/19-22 and had incredible customer service (like the kind you forgot existed b/c customer service is such a forgotten art). We had some crazy shenanigans occur during the first night of our stay. Down on the corner near the hotel some crazy guy set up a full drum kit and started playing drums REALLY LOUD. Like Slayer concert loud, and it was ~10:00 PM. We called down to the front desk and spoke to Liz, who called the police to regulate, and they did. Later that night (3:00 AM-ish) three gentleman staying in the room next to us returned from the bars and were also REALLY LOUD. We called down to the front desk again and again spoke with Liz who sent someone up to settle our neighbors down. All of that was already great, but then the next day Liz sent us up a post-card with a gift from the hotel. That was really above and beyond and was very thoughtful. So often when you stay at hotels these days the service isn't all that great and it seems like hotels are just trying to get heads in beds, get paid and move onto the next. Our experience at the Monaco was such a welcome departure from that way of doing business and restored our faith that true customer service really does exist out there. Thanks!


Room Tip: They have rooms that overlook the river that are really nice.

Green Features: Monaco is a Kimpton Hotel and they very committed to environmentally-friendly practices, which I agree with and support."
"In Chicago for 4 nights with friends and chose the Hotel Monaco mainly due to its great location. From the moment we checked in, we could tell this hotel had something special - friendly, attentive staff - ALL of them! Ok, you usually can find 1 or 2 staff at any hotel who are always smiling, pleasant and willing to help - this applies to all of them here!! They couldn't help enough! We stayed in a suite on the 11th floor, big bathroom (incl. jaccuzi tub), mini-bar, fridge, safe, pull out sofa bed etc etc. Everything you could imagine and very clean and tidy. Free wifi throughout the hotel (just join the Kimpton loyalty program) and free bike hire for up to 4 hours - just book this with reception - a great way to explore the City! The reception area has plenty of space where you can sit and relax. During our visit, they offered a free glass (or two) of wine between 5 & 6pm - a nice way to start your evening! The concierge were so informative whenever we wanted to know where to go, advice on restaurants etc. I would thoroughly recommend this hotel if you're looking for great customer service and a great location. Well done Kimpton and you should be proud of your amazing staff at the Hotel Monaco."
"Stayed a week at The Monaco Hotel for business and pleasure. The hotel is beautiful clean. The rooms are spacious and comfortable. The room has blackout shades making the rooms great for sleeping. The hotel offers toiletries and other items. The staff are great. They are helpful and are willing to help in any situation. Wine hour is generous. The only drawback is we had a room right across from the elevator. We could hear people right outside our door. The train is a block away and we could hear the train. Luckily we brought a white noise maker so the noise was blocked. Otherwise I do not think we would have been as rested. Overall, I do recommend this hotel. The cost is fair and the service is outstanding."
"We brought my mother to celebrate her 90th and the staff couldn't have been nicer. They even kept the secret about who was joining us. They made my mom feel very special and every request was met promptly and with a smile. Everyone seemed to anticipate our needs. It was a delightful visit.

"Our experience at this hotel last year was very disappointing. This year, they could not have done anything more to make our stay just perfect.We arrived early and were immediately assigned a room as requested - on a top floor in a quiet location. Unfortunately, housekeeping had not completed their tasks (computer glitch). Rather than wait for another room, we said we would leave while they finished cleaning the room. We were compensated for this inconvenience with an offer of free breakfast, which we thought was very generous. The woman at the front desk who took very good care of us was named Frances. The Hotel Monaco is lucky to have her as an employee. We enjoyed our stay and hope to return once again next year..


Green Features: Free WiFi if you belong to Kimpton Karma - otherwise it costs money."
"We stayed for seven nights at the hotel monaco and had a fabulous time.The location was perfect next to all the sights and nightlife.All of the Staff we encountered were friendly professional and helpful. A big thank you to the concierge Sheila and receptionist Kirsten in particular.They left treats in my room to celebrate my birthday and nothing was too much trouble.Coffee is provided from 7_9am complimentary and there is a wine hour between 5_6pm which is a lovely touch.The rooms are well designed and have lovely window seats with views of chicago.The adjoining restaurant provides very good food although a little on the pricey side.I would not hesitate in recommending this hotel when visiting chicago and wish to thank all the wonderful staff for providing me with a wonderful experience for my fortieth birthday in chicago.

"We love to travel to Chicago when we can spare a couple of days and decided to try out the Monaco Hotel. Overall, the hotel was very nice. We were given complimentary drink coupons when we arrived. It was clean and we loved our room. There was a very cozy seating cove overlooking the street with pillows. The location was convenient and staff was very nice. The only issue we had was that one of our keys did not work. We had to go back a couple of times to get things right, but easy enough to address."
"We were here for 6 nights in double queen room on 12th floor - 2 adults and teenage girl - we found it a large room for a big city hotel downtown - the two beds / pillows very comfortable - sleep quality high - window seat is huge and was a perfect nook get away for our teenager - the view of river, bridges, Wacker Ave was excellent - we did not experience street noise issues - black out curtains very effective . Washroom is huge - tons of hot water - good towels - it is so large it is easily useful for dressing privately - could use a bench and more wall hooks / racks . Elevator service is OK. --An in room safe located in closet easily fits an I Pad and more Good coffee in lobby every morning - and equally good wine hour 5 - 6 PM every afternoon. Walking distance to lots of good stuff to do -- and plentiful restaurants / bars / clubs nearby . Little tip ...have lunch at BillyGoats located lower street level in front of Wrigley bldg -- it's the place the SNL cheezeborger skit was born ... a riot to be sure.


Room Tip: River View room on a higher floor is a good choice.

"My two sons 7 and 12 stayed with us here along with our pampered kitty cat and we loved this hotel. We couldn't have asked for such a perfect stay. The welcome gifts for the kids and the goldfish on loan for our room were such welcoming touches. Perfect location to get around the city at ease and wine reception in the evenings to boot. The room was clean, spacious and modern. Loved it! The seating area overlooking the city made quite an impression with our sons who enjoyed gazing out at the city lights prior to bedtime. Was a pleasurable vacation at a perfect A+ Rated Property within walking distance to just about everything. Thanks for such great memories!"
"First time in Chicago and the staff were awesome. A special shout out to Michael the door man who gave us great advice on tours, food and entertainment. The room was wonderful; we were in 807. Although it is outside the elevator, the second bed by the bay window overlooking the city is an excellent touch. Less than a 5 minute walk to all major attractions (subway, Magnificent Mile, Lincoln Park, bars, etc.). I will be there again.


Room Tip: pick one with a bay window. (i.e. 807)

"Spent two nights at the Monaco in early July for our annual weekend away without the kids. We arrived just as the wine reception was wrapping up on the first night, so the lobby was loud and busy... can't really fault the front desk staff for a bit of a hasty check-in. Our room was on the 14th floor, and had a great river view. The room was also exceptionally clean! We enjoyed a great first night out and came back for a good night's rest. Now here's the not-so-good... we hadn't realized the night before that our room (I think it was 1417) was a connecting room. At 6:20 the next morning, the four ladies in the room next to us started their day. It was as if they were in the room with us, it was so loud. We could hear every word they were saying! They weren't being unreasonably loud... there's just no sound barrier whatsoever. My husband went to get coffee and spoke to the front desk staff. He made arrangements to speak to the manager when he arrived for his shift. We were moved to a room down the hall and the noise level was much better. The only downside was that there was no cushion in the window seat in that room. When we headed out later that day, my husband mentioned it to the manager, who told him he'd have a cushion in there when we got back later in the day. When we arrived, he told us that he couldn't put one in that specific room (seemed strange) but that he'd have the staff leave lots of extra blankets and pillows for us to make it cozy. When we got back, there was a single blanket and pillow in the window seat. At that point, it didn't seem worth following up, as it was late and our last night at the hotel. You can't beat the location of the hotel, the staff was friendly enough, and we really appreciated the complimentary umbrella as it was a rainy weekend. Definitely didn't get the rest we'd hoped for, though. Will probably try a different property if we return to Chicago again.

"My family stayed three nights at the Monaco recently while we were visiting Chicago museums and landmarks. The location is perfect for getting around on foot. The Riverwalk, Milennium Park, the Art Institute, Navy Pier, theaters, etc, as well as some good restaurants, are within walking distance. Everyone on staff was very friendly. We enjoyed the daily 5 PM wine reception and the water ""bar"" near the elevator. Our 9-year-old daughter was tickled to be given a treat bag with cards and small toys. The hotel has stylish decor and a small-hotel feel. Nice ""extras"" are provided in the rooms, like terry robes and cotton balls/Q-tips. I would prefer an in-room coffee/tea maker to the yoga mat, though.Rooms with windows overlooking Wabash get noise from the ""L"" train; this could be a problem for light sleepers, since the trains run all night. Other than that, the hotel was quiet. We had a room near the elevators, and did not hear them or guests arriving at our floor. Unlike a lot of other hotels at which I've stayed, the Monaco has a large locked room for luggage storage, and a secure system for claiming bags after they've been stored. We appreciated that, since our transportation out of the city was late on our day of departure, and we had a chance to explore the city after check-out without worrying about our bags."
"Stayed at this hotel last week with my wife and 2 teenage girls. The location is excellent. The people working there are very nice. The room, beds and bathroom are all excellent also. But I made a rookie mistake not requesting a quiet room and as a result we ended up with a room in the front of the building right near the elevator. I usually request ahead of time a quiet room not hear an elevator and not facing the front/main street. The elevator was not too bad, but the front of the hotel is on Wabash street about 1/2 a block up from where the L (elevated subway) makes a sharp turn from Lake to Wabash. Every L train that goes by makes screeching metal on metal sound as it makes the turn. This goes on late into the night and starts early in the morning. If you are a light sleeper like I am, this sound can wake you up at anytime. So - had I been randomly assigned to a quieter room I would have rated this hotel excellent.The only other issue is they do not have free wifi. Lots of hotels charge for this. It just seems like nickle and diming to me. I had to go to Starbucks around the corner to get wifi for my tablet. A bit of inconvenience but worth noting.


Room Tip: request a room not on the front of the hotel or side of hotel facing L on State street.

"We have stayed here many times and always enjoy our stay. Rooms are clean. Service excellent. My only complaint this trip is hotel monaco used to have top shelf lotions and shampoo from aveda, now just some cheap typical hotel stuff. Also, there is no coffee maker in the room, you can go downstairs to get coffee. I love the window seats but they no longer have the cushion to sit on so it's not very comfortable. Would still recommend, but just slightly less than I would have before."
"Stayed here for a few nights in late July. Really one of the few places I can say I have no issues with. It was a great stay. PROS:Excellent rooms, beds, mini-bar, bathrooms, etc.Quiet, doors don't slam, hallways seemed quiet. Nice lobby, restaurant on premises, concierge, etc. I have stayed at a few other nearby hotels recently including the Marriott, Springhill Suites and Westin and this was, by far, better than all of those. I will be staying here again next visit to Chicago."
"We stayed in one of the rooms with a spa tub. It was a very nice room with a comfortable bed. We visited last February and it was cold outside. But the location is near the Magnificent Mile and within walking distance of some great locations. The windows have a deep ledge you can comfortable sit on and watch out of. It seems strange, but it was very fun to sit and talk with each other while we looked out the window at people walking and driving by. There are nice restaurants all over and if you need a cab, the hotel staff are on top of it. The staff is knowledgeable and offered great ideas for places to go and things to do. Everybody was very nice and the check out time was at noon, so we weren't rushed even on the day we left. I highly recommend it!


Room Tip: Rooms with spa tubs are fun to help spark the romance.

I had not stayed in a Kimpton hotel before and was impressed by the high quality of customer service at every level. I asked for a quiet room and they had it - room 1217. No view other than a masonry wall on the next door building. I was told that the hotel was 10 years old. The room is starting to show its age. Still comfortable and clean but a bit worn. Elevator and the cab needs updating. The South Water Kitchen in the hotel was very good. Had an omelet delivered for breakfast which was excellent. A great value for the night at $250.
"We stayed for two nights at the Hotel Monaco Chicago. We were welcomed by a very nice bell man and were quickly checked in by a very friendly front desk. Our room was already available so we were able to enjoy the room with view on the river. Since my parents are European they needed electrical converters because they've forgot this important gadget at our house. They even had that at the front desk. I was very pleased. Valet parking is 56 Dollars per day but it is very worth it since you are downtown and parking is horrible like in every big city. For my next visit in Chicago, I will not have to look very far. I will stay again in a heart beat at the Hotel Monaco Chicago."
"It was my first visit to Chicago and I picked this hotel largely based on reviews here and the location. We were put into a room on the 2nd floor, which was still quiet and had an adequate view. What it did not have was one of the cute window seats that you see in the pictures, but that was not a problem for us. the location was so convenient that we never needed a taxi. We moved here from a hotel near O'Hare using the Blue Line and we departed by taking the L to Midway - quite easy if you are packing reasonably. We were also able to walk to great restaurants and shops and grab a nearby bus to the Museum of Science and Industry. Even if the hotel had not been great, I would have stayed here again just for the great location.At the hotel we really appreciated the umbrella in our room during a Saturday morning downpour. The bed was very comfortable. At check out, they held our bags for a full day while we were sightseeing before our flight. The staff was friendly - giving directions and making restaurant recommendations. We had drinks from the bar one night and they were delicious. Our one room service breakfast was on time and equally good. We were so busy that we didn't just hang around the hotel a lot, so I am sure there was more we could have appreciated there.The only negative was one night and morning the neighboring room was outrageously loud with blaring music. Who does that in a hotel?


Room Tip: Stay above the second floor if you want the cute window seat.

"Smiling warm sincere greeting upon arrival; we had a ""Planes, Trains and Automobiles"" trip from O'Hare (here's a tip; hire a car/cab for $35 trip to downtown - the two Blue Line one 20"" high step up Bus was not for the older traveler - totally exhausted after an already long flight) and after hitting the super clean room with neat window nook seats overlooking Wabash/Wacker/The River, we flopped down on two exquisite beds before rallying to hit McCormick&Schmick's next block over for some delicious Long Island Blue Points. Great location, great service, great staff, great hotel."
"As a Kimpton In-Touch member we have come to enjoy the coffee bars in the mornings, happy hour in the evenings, unique themed decor, and the kids particularly like the exotic animal-print bath robes. While the Hotel Monaco Brand is hip and contemporary enough to make for a great couples getaway they also do a great job of accommodating families. As a family of 5 their King and Queen connecting rooms have been perfect for us. Their rooms are very spacious and all have been able to accommodate a rollaway as our teens have become more ""territorial"" with their sleeping space. While the exterior of the Hotel location leads you to wander about the accommodations, once the helpful doorman assists you entering the hotel you are comforted with the usual Hotel Monaco feel, amenities and accommodating staff. This location is also great for hopping on the EL, taking a river tour, grabbing one of their bikes and heading out to the lake shore, and all of the great sites scenes and museums at the nearby Millennium and Grant Parks. I would also be remiss to mention that you are a block off of Michigan avenue and all of its great shopping and restaurants.


Room Tip: Wifi is free for In-Touch members.

"Upbeat, cool hotel. My room had a view of the river which was great, except for the large TRUMP letters on hi hotel. The staff was friendly and helpful, but could have been more helpful with dinner locations. They kept suggesting chain restaurants, which I try to avoid, especially in a city like Chicago with many great eateries.One odd thing, I booked through Expedia and when I tried to provide my Kimpton number, they would not accept it. So, I only got free Wi-Fi, an not their other standard perks. Not sure why since the price for the room was the same through Expedia and the hotel's online booking services.

"Visited this past week for 3 nights and absolutely enjoyed it. Was here last winter and was not quite as enthused. I am chalking that up to the room we received each time, or possibly the hotel is in a constantly improving mode. (paint/touch ups etc.) Stayed in room 911 which was a corner mini suite with 4 window seats overlooking the river. Views were outstanding and we caught ourselves gazing out the window at night for a long time. Location is perfect for all downtown activities. Bed was comfortable and clean. Bathroom is a bit small (especially the shower stall), but clean and stocked with high end products. Service all the way around was superb (especially the doormen, they were awesome. I'm back on board, this is my go to hotel hotel in Chicago once again.

"You are in for a rare treat here excellent personal service, we arrived early at 11am & would have been ok hold off until 3pm but not only did she have a room ready but as it was our first time there we were given one of few rooms overlooking the Corn Cobs & rivers with the window seats you read in other reviews (that is the way to get a newbie back time after time). Its going to be a great 5 days. Be warned that these room with a view are in full ears distance from the L, so if you are a sensitive sleeper this may not be for you, the L starts squeaking on those tracks early. It is a well decorated Parisian boudoir inspiration, bed was comfy, & as I prefer in any hotel the comforter was covered in a double sheet. My only complaint are the pillows they are just not comfortable at all both the BF & I were up several times re-fluffing them if your better half snores brace yourself.Also be warned this is a VERY pet friendly hotel so you if you are opposed to that or allergic this might not be the hotel for you. There is a nightly wine reception, it was a great way to cool off & get inspired before venturing out for dinner. I will review the restaurant on it own, but make sure to go there try what I call the ""Ethereal Eggs"" or their take on devil eggs & I would suggest ordering the SWK burger & taking it upstairs putting on your robe provided & going at it. It is absolutely in the top 3 burgers Ive had in my life, but you will moan, groan & your eyes will roll into the back of your head (if you cook it no more than medium rare) so I suggest making this a private moment. If you are traveling alone this is the perfect place to go .... look for my extended review. We will be back here, this is certainly a gem among all the hotels in the area

"If you are traveling to Chicago as a tourist or leisure-man I would highly recommend the Monaco. The hotel definitely adds a level of service that I think other hotels should aspire to. People often say ""why would you spend so much on a hotel room when all you are going to do is sleep there?"" Often this is true, and likewise it seems that many hotels that we would consider ""luxe"" have taken this mindset towards their leisure travelers. Even with a high loyalty status at chains such as Hilton or Marriott, you are met with very little appreciation and there is no anticipation of your needs. Granted, if you ask for it they'll usually happily oblige, if you don't speak up, they are also happy to oblige with only supplying you that ""room to sleep there."" I say all this because Monaco is just a little bit different. First, as you will have read in the reviews, the box window seats are one of the coolest features I have ever seen in a hotel. The first day/night, we didn't even turn the television on because we were so fascinated by it and the views it provided.Second, everyone is genuinely happy and smiling. It seems funny to say, but it does add just a little bit.Third, they made our stay special. I won't say exactly what they did, but it was absolutely hilarious and it made our day.Fourth, the room looks exactly like it is pictured online. It can be so frustrating to show up at a hotel and have your hopes up for a place that looks awesome in the pictures only to find the devil in the details. I would say that our room lived up to the picture with at least 95% accuracy, which is pretty darn good.Fifth, the room was actually very clean. You shouldn't have to worry about this when staying anywhere, ever, but you do. This room was clean.There were some minor setbacks that you can expect anywhere - the concierge lost our tickets for something (they fixed it); absolutely tiny things like no ice bag for the bucket; the bed was not as comfortable as I might have expected. They may want to invest in a more comfortable bed as I would say that the Sheraton, Westin and Hilton beds are all more comfortable (noticeably). Overall the stay was excellent. We will surely keep Kimpton in mind as we travel and if ever back in Chicago we'll look them up.

"We always try to stay in a Kimpton hotel when we travel out of town. We love the service and support when we stay. This visit was no different than other Kimpton hotels we've stayed at (in San Francisco, DC & Chicago). When we registered we learned we got an upgrade to a Suite, which was great since we were traveling with our daughter. This hotel is centrally located and we were able to get there from the train station easily on the bus. We entered our room and were greeted by a beautifully decorated space with deep windows seats overlooking the river. This room was simply wonderful. The bathroom had a huge tub our daughter loves to soak in at the end of the day walking in Chicago. Two robes were hanging on the door available to us to use.We spent time in the lobby drinking hot chocolate and watching the people come in and out with their holiday shopping. Such a lovely lobby. It was quite cold while we were visiting the city, but that didn't stop us from exploring the city. We went skating at Millennium park and ate lots of yummy food. It was a great trip

"I always stay at this hotel when I travel to Chicago. It's location is superb, very close to the trains, buses, water taxis or just plain walking. The shopping is very close and restaurants and Rush street are just within it's doors. The staff is amazing, attentive and the hotel is clean and quiet. Love the views, wine reception is fun and inviting and people watching in the lobby is fantastic!"
"I stayed in both in consecutive weeks...while Chicago is good, and Michael the doorman/bellman is a wonderful ambassador for the hotel, and the city, Michelle the manager of the dining room, was somewhat rude, when I sent back a cold dish, it came back still cold, and she put her hands on her hips and said something like, ""what is wrong with it?"" in a rude manner...unlike most of the Kimpton associates who are so customer friendly...I told her, and since I was in a hurry, I couldn't wait for them to redo the dish (a flatbread with gobs of runny goat cheese, and a few small pieces of ""beef tenderloin"" , tiny and cold....I told her ok, and mentioned her attitude, and she then said she was sorry, and offered to comp the whole meal, which i declined, telling her that I'd rather she change her attitude with future guests than comp the other parts of my meal....again she wasn't awful, but a bit rude, and I am used to the amazing service and attitude you get from other Kimpton folks...."
"We arrived late at night due to a substantial delay in our train from San Francisco, but was still greeted by a friendly receptionist who completed check-in procedures quickly and effectively. We had paid extra for a riverside view and was given a room on the 12th floor. We really didn't know what to expect from the advertised seating areas in the panoramic windows, but imagine our reaction when we opened the curtains at just before midnight to see the lights of Trump Tower and other skyscraper buildings lighting up Chicago and the river down below with a variety of small boats still going up and down - priceless!!We choose Kimpton now due to its very high levels of customer service and perks offered to its ""In Touch"" members and we were certainly not disappointed with any aspects of this hotel from its rooms, its staff or its location. If you do chose this hotel, pay that little bit extra for a river view room - we sat in the window last Monday night when a severe storm hit Chicago, amazed when the top of Trump Tower and other skyscrapers disappeared into low cloud and transfixed by the lightning storm displayed overhead.

"My fiance and I spent a week in Chicago for his birthday, and after reading a number of reviews on Tripadvisor, we selected Hotel Monaco. From the very first moment we arrived, we were catered to. The man at the door, Antonio, was friendly and courteous and KNOWLEDGEABLE. He understood our frayed nerves after six hours of holiday/rush hour driving. He took our bags, parked our car, and pointed us to the wine reception in the lobby. After unpacking, he directed us to a MAGNIFICENT, yet unknown restaurant that was the opposite of a tourist trap. We tried to tip him, but he said it was his job and that he loves doing it. Every time we saw him, he had something helpful to say. Next was Dana at the front desk. She greeted us with a warm demeanor and checked us in promptly. There was a delicious snack left in the room with compliments for my fiance's birthday, which was a nice personal touch, and Dana gave us excellent directions and some good suggestions for night life. The room? Sparkling clean and the view was breathtaking. The bed was comfortable and the towels were soft and fluffy. We almost didn't want to leave that night because we were so tired. The walls were quiet, the curtains blocked out all lights, and there was virtually no street noise--a light sleeper's dream.The next day, housekeeping cleaned the room to sparkling again, and they left us a personal note and birthday greetings. Like I said, the attention to detail in every aspect of the visit was shocking, especially in a time in which businesses seem to be cutting corners. Every time we came back to the hotel, we were personally greeted. Check out was similarly fast and friendly with Gwen, and my bill was accurate and easy to read. I have stayed in hotels from California to New York, and this is honestly the nicest, cleanest, and friendliest. We actually are coming back in August simply for a chance at another mini-vacation...just because of the experience. In fact, as soon as I am finished here, I am going to write a letter to the corporate office to let them know.

"Our four days at the Hotel Monaco were absolutely perfect. The staff could not have been more helpful and friendly...we were given wonderful advice and recommendations from the concierge. We loved the cocktail hour in the late afternoon with free wine and treats. The location is brilliant with nearly all major sights (Michigan Avenue, Millenium Park, River North, etc.) within walking distance. My favorite aspect of the hotel however was the room. The beds were deliciously comfortable. The window seat was a perfect spot to read and watch boats float down the river. The decor was tasteful and unique. Plus, the goldfish was a great touch. Out of all the hotels I have stayed at in Chicago the Hotel Monaco is by far my favorite."
"Just returned from a Chicago weekend based at the Monaco and was fully satisfied. Room was spacious, well-appointed and spotless. Staff was very accomodating and professional and the restaurant served an excellent brunch (plus a free wine reception every day) Be sure to join their free club to get free wi-fi and a $10 voucher for the bar or mini-bar. Valet parked is $56 per day and you can save by self-parking at several lots within a block. Hotel is easily walkable to many attractions including the Art Institute and shopping."
"We had a great stay Friday - Sunday of Memorial Day weekend at the Hotel Monaco. Had Room 1108 which had cool window seats and a great view of Marina City -- the two sixty story concrete towers which mix parking and unique architecture, as well as the new Trump tower thing.Hotel Monaco is charming and comfortable. Sleep quality is quite high -- we could hear the El wheels squeaking but we got right to sleep -- that wasn't that loud. Water pressure in the showers is terrific. Service and cleanliness of rooms was five stars for us. Front desk, bell stand, etc. very Midwestern courteous. A true pleasure. I think we dealt with about 8 different hotel employees and never heard a cross word or experienced inefficiency -- they fell over themselves helping us out.Business center was great. The printer was one of the best I've ever had in a hotel experience. The Hotel Monaco has a usage charge thing which is a bit obnoxious, but if you brought your laptop you could use the metered computer gizmo just for printing. Again, the printer quality in color was outstanding, enabling us to print off a variety of google maps for tourism in chicago.TIP: Request the in-room Keurig coffee maker. That's a nice wake up cup of Joe. We ate at the restaurant for brunch on Sunday. Did a great job with bacon, omelette was OK. Probably the weakest aspect of our stay. The charge on the parking overnight is like $56, but that's downtown Chicago.Overall, fantastic stay. It is great to be at a comfortable, smaller hotel. We really liked the location. Easy walking distance to Michigan Avenue, Navy Pier, etc. And I enjoyed looking at the Bob Newhart Marina City towers at day or night. Also, it is amazing how cleaned up downtown Chicago is now. Very gentrified. Great riverwalk, etc. We had a terrific visit. Thank you Kimpton."
"I stayed here for four nights in May. Its location, on Wabash at the Chicago River is, to me, perfect for walking all around Chicago. River North, Michigan Avenue, State Street, the Loop, Millenium Park, etc. are all within easy walking distance. The Blue Line direct from the airport drops nearby (at Clark and Lake), so it is convenient to get there using mass transit.Once at the hotel, I was upgraded to a beautiful one-bedroom suite (I am a Kimpton Inner Circle member). The suite, overlooking the Chicago River, was beautifully decorated, quiet, and a serene place to reside while in Chicago. The views from the 4 (yes four, three large (they are about the size of a full-size bed (no lie), one smaller) window seats were amazing. A friend and I sat in them late every night and enjoyed wine and cheese.The bath had a whirpool tub and stand-up shower. My own personal preference would be to have had a slightly larger shower in the room (and I prefer showers that also include a hand-held shower head as well), but it is an older building (like most Kimptons) that has been retrofitted for a new life (and beautifully done).The staff, like almost all Kimptons, was welcoming and friendly. They all sought to make my stay memorable and enjoyable. This began with emails from Erica, the assistant manager (a big shout out to her!), prior to my arrival through every person at the hotel.If you have not stayed at a Kimpton Hotel, you should. And if your trip takes you to Chicago, Hotel Monaco is a superb choice. I highly recommend it.

"Foster is a really nice check-in person who made sure our first stay at a Kimpton Hotel was a pleasant experience. Our room has two bay windows overlooking the Chicago River. It keeps our boys (under 10) occupied. The decor is very mismatched. The bathroom definitely could use some extra storage for toiletries and a change of clothes. Rich, the concierge was irritated with our request for help with our dinner reservation. After spending 8 hours traveling, patience and a helpful attitude is most appreciated. Rich needs to work on this."
"Great staff here and the potential for excellence, however my first night was way below par. We hired a suite (not inexpensive) but in spite of assurances that the sofa-bed would be made up in readiness from my return from supper, we had to chase and chase to get this implemented. Have to say the quality of the sofa-bed was more budget hotel/motel than up-market boutique. Shame, because, it's in a great location with great staff."
"Where do I began about this beautiful hotel. My husband and I found this hotel online just browsing hotels that had a jacuzzi tub. Read the reviews afterwards, then made reservations for the mediterranean spa.The room was everything we wanted, just beautiful. The staff the atmosphere the location the surroundings, nice overall. HIGHLY recommended and most definetly we'll be using this hotel again!"
"This hotel is in the middle of everything and small enough to remember my name every time I walked in the door. I was in Chi town for a military graduation and my birthday, and the concierge and doorman were amazing. The room was beautiful and clean, and the complimentary HH each night made it feel like home! I absolutely recommend this hotel to anyone visiting the theater district or for Macys (formerly historic Marshall Fields) shopping.

"Our family just returned from a wonderful stay at Hotel Monaco. Charles the concierge was very helpful with our early check-in. The suite was beautiful, with great river views from the four cool window benches. Our daughters loved them. Loved the corner suite. The staff was fantastic with our kids. Thanks so much for sending the birthday surprise for Lily. She was delighted. The in room fish was a big hit with both of our daughters. My husband and I enjoyed the restaurant - a nice surprise.


Room Tip: Suite was very special. 14th floor location provided great views.

"For our trip to chicago, we were looking for something in downtown chicago which was affordable and nice. Monaco fits the bill perfectly ! Right in the center of the city, close to the riverwalk and most Chicago attractions are within a short walk or a short cab ride.. The only star I removed was for the fact that we got a room with restricted view.

"I stayed here on a business trip but had to bring along my 11-month-old son and was very pleased with the baby-friendly offerings. The hotel room itself was lovely -- high ceilings and spacious and very clean. It included nice little things like bathrobes and an umbrella in case of rain. You had to request an in-room coffee maker, which I didn't realize until the second day, however.The hotel gets extra credit from me for the baby-proofing they'll do for you if you call ahead: they will put a crib in your room and stick outlet covers on all the visible outlets and baby proof the toilet seat.The location was PERFECT. Walking distance to everything we wanted to do downtown: Grant Park, the Field Museum and the Chicago River walk.Staff were super-friendly and quick to get you whatever you needed. The only disappointment was the food -- even for room service, I thought it was overpriced. My husband and I got two oatmeals, a pitcher of coffee and a glass of OJ...for $50. Would have been nice if breakfast was included like many of the other downtown hotels. They do have a 5 p.m. (free) wine hour but I would have preferred a breakfast buffet! We didn't try the restaurant downstairs but it did look nice."
"For my first trip to Chicago, I hoped to find a medium between spoiling myself with a nice-looking hotel yet at an affordable rate -- this one hit the sweet spot.Pulling up to the hotel, I was nervous because I didn't notice the hotel between the bar and an awkward still-under-construction walkway. But there was a man at the door, two women in the lobby, another in the bar, all helpful and ready to assist when needed. The service feels exceeding when there's more staff around rather than just one at the check-in counter. Especially after a six-hour flight, so I was looking for recommendations on immediate food and drinks.To be honest, I made some ludicrous requests to the hotel during the weekend. Stumbling into the lobby in the middle of the night with a box of leftovers, I was pretty drunk and probably didn't quite articulate that I needed to eat what was in the box as soon as possible. And I needed water and utensils. The front desk grabbed the bag in my hand and sent me back up to my room with a smile. Within minutes, another man arrived at my door with the food heated up on a serving plate with knife, fork, napkin, and five water bottles. He basically descended from whatever heavenly atmosphere and saved me a terrible headache in the morning. This is not including the nice note they had waiting for me in the room my first night (I had mentioned it was a special occasion during my reservation). The note welcomed me to Chicago and so on, which is a small but kindly touch. Some of the other guests were older, and I'm going to just say, appeared to have a lot more spending room than I did. So if we're kickin' it in the same spot, I figure I did a pretty good job.What sets the hotel apart other than the service is the decor. The rooms have themes, every theme is different. Lighter green, airy rooms. Red, dark, sexy rooms. Striped rooms, rooms with interesting lamps. I like the concept throughout the lobby, the carpeting, the hallways, etc. But the rooms got a little crazy for me. This sounds terrible, but I have no other analogy -- the room reminds me of those stage rooms in Ikea they set up? The red room was a bit tacky. If anything, the red highlighted the layer of dust across the couch even if the room was dimly lit. I felt a little uneasy. Also, the shower was a tight fit, though I enjoyed the high water pressure. By now, I've gotten used to wiping down the telephone and remote control at every hotel. With the great service, I wasn't bothered much by the rest of the details. My recommendation? Go look at your room, and if you get a weird one, just go back down and ask for a different room. On my last day, another couple mentioned they got the red room too and realized there was a blue one that would've been much warmer to stay in.They have a happy hour. It's free wine, and when I was there, pizza. Get on it."
"Our group travelled from Toronto into Chicago for a 3 day, 2 night incentive trip getaway and we were very pleased with our hotel selection! The group reps were a pleasure to deal with and the reservation, arrival, reception and checkout systems as well. Our group especially appreciated the ecletic yet contemporary decor the Monaco offered while the ambiance was one of elegance and serenety. From the well served daily manager's wine and flatbreads to the attention to detail in offering fruit\vegetable flavoured water by the elevators, we were truly happy with our experience at the Monaco.We strongly recommend this location and this staff if you are planning a weekend stay with a group."
"I loved the unique decor, friendly staff, convenient location, and the reasonable price. Our room was spacious, beds were comfortable and my son loved the huge, cushioned window seat with a partial view of the river. The complimentary wine hour offered each day, as well as coffee in the lobby each morning, upped the ""fun quotient"" of our stay. Would definitely return.

"I stayed at the Hotel Monaco last week for a very short business trip; 1 night. I found the location to be conveniently located and the staff I encountered to be friendly and accomodating. My father lives in Milwaukee, but was unable to drive down, so he took the train. In looking for directions to the Union Station, Frances at the front desk heard me talking with another front desk host. When I arrived back at the hotel with my dad, she welcomed us with a ""This must be Dad!"", which thrilled my father. The room was clean and nicely furnished with very comfortable beds. If I had to find something to criticize, I'd say I could hear road traffic during rush hour even thought we were on the 7th floor, Riverview Room. We walked to Harry Carey's for a delightful dinner... and ate a delicious lunch at the South Water Grill. I saw an unfavorable review for the restaurant and was surprised. There were 2 others in my group that ate later and also thoroughly enjoyed their meals.Maybe it was the menu items?!? I'd also like to commend the Bellmen we encountered while there. Both were friendly and helpful, but one in particular (wish I had his name) declined my tip after hailing a cab for us stating that we'd already taken care of him earlier and he was happy to help! I was shocked someone was turning down cash.My only regret is I was unable to partake in the Kimpton free wine Happy Hour because I was working. Would definitely go back next time my travels take me to Chicago."
"Hotel Monaco is an absolute jewel located conveniently to restaurants, Michigan Ave, and transportation on Wabash near Wacker Dr. I held a meeting for a small executive group with people from all parts of the US and we were very satisfied with the service and accommodations. Since the meeting was informal, I decided to rent a suite and hold the meeting in the living room portion of the room and this turned out to be a great choice. The lobby and common areas of the hotel have a fun and welcoming vibe with a friendly staff that make you feel at home. There is wifi access in the lobby with fun music in the background. Fresh Starbuck's offered gratis in the am and a complement of wines in the evening in the lobby. The concierge service was very helpful and offered up great ideas for dinners out and offered to make reservations. The rooms are appointed beautifully with comfy robes and striking bedding, furniture and accessories. We did not want to leave. The room service staff could not have been more helpful (for one request all we needed was a few spoons and waters and the delivery person could not have been nicer). We dined at sister hotels, the Burnham and Allegro and enjoyed those locales as well. What a treasure!

"I stayed here for 2 night with my husband in January - right as the polar vortex was hitting Chicago! Rooms were clean and warm, and the bed was very comfortable. The bellman was very helpful - taught us about falling ice and what buildings you should walk right next to and which you should walk closer to the street, so as not to get hit with the falling ice. A close walking distance to the Mag Mile, the ""Bean"" at Millennium Park, etc. The voucher for the mini bar was an added plus. I wouldn't hesitate to stay here again!"
"Everyone at this hotel and its restaurant, South Water Kitchen, were very friendly and helpful. We were always greeted when we walked in the door. The doorman always opened the door and got taxis when we needed them. The concierge made good suggestions about restaurants and got us reservations. Staff at the front desk were friendly and helpful, too. The 5PM wine reception in the lobby was an opportunity to talk to other guests, which we always like to do. The location is very convenient to the things that we wanted to do in Chicago. Bed and room were very comfortable and the room was quiet. Based on our experience here, I would give preference to Kimpton Hotels in the future."
"I've always stayed at the Hyatt when in Chicago, but my last time there was just too much--too many people, not enough fast service, etc. So I opted for the Hotel Monaco this time, and I was VERY pleased! First, I love dogs, so it was nice to see so many animals around. The decor was just beautiful, the staff very nice and helpful, and the room was clean and comfortable. Plus a wine happy hour every day doesn't hurt!It was an easy walk to other places, easy to get a cab to McCormick, and the restaurant next door is top notch (Sweet Water). I will come back!"
"stayed here for a conference. Room was nice and big. Liked the entryway into my room. Gave it a two room feel. Bathroom was off this foyer type area. Tall sink, great water pressure and plenty of hot water. The shower head was also well above my head. Always a plus. Room was very clean and decently stocked mini-bar. Not just food products but also some items you may have forgotten. Side note, some of those should have been free, I.e toothbrush, toothpaste, those are provided at other upscale hotels if a guest is forgetful. Conference room was comfortable and the lunches were your basic conference foods. Filling but just okay. Room 702 does face a parking garage and a wall so not much of a view on my side. Also, the wine tasting ends at 6 on the dot. the room was full and at 6 the wine was taken away. So dont linger if you want to get a glass. When i am in town i may stay here again."
"We've stayed at the Hotel Palomar, another Kimpton Hotel in Chicago, and loved it. Every staff member we met was very friendly, helpful and professional. When we left, we felt like we were leaving new friends, and we looked forward to seeing them again.This was not the case at the Hotel Monaco. The only outstanding staff member was the day shift valet person (I wish I remembered his name). He was friendly and informative from our first greeting to our departure two days later. The front desk was aloof. Once we checked in, we passed the front desk numerous times and they didn't acknowledge, let alone greet us. The concierge was not very helpful. Upon departure we called the front desk and asked for our car from the valet. After quite some time in the lobby, it became obvious our car had not been called up. The only person that seemed concerned about this, was the aforementioned valet person. I'm sure what makes such a dramatic difference in the level of service. It must either be hiring practices, training, management, or a combination. The Palomar is doing something very right and it makes us want to go gack. The Monaco is just another hotel in Chicago to us, and with the host of hotel options in Chicago, I doubt we will ever go back. We've stayed in Holiday Inn Expresses at half the price that had more enthusiastic, helpful and friendly staff than the Monaco. We've stayed at The Trump, Waldorf-Astoria and Ritz-Carlton for twice the price and the staff at the Palomar were every bit as good.The highlight of the Monaco was the padded window ledges. Very nice to sit in, and a very unique feature for hotels in town. It may just be our perception, but the bathroom tile and shower seemed older than the rest of the room. The room was a nice size and it was clean. The beds were too hard for our tastes, and we like firm beds.The location is fantastic. Everything we wanted to do seemed to be within a ten minute walk. We wish we had better news, and as In Touch members we would like to love all Kimpton hotels.


Green Features: We appreciated the small can for recycling items. We used it for bottle, newspapers and magazines that would normally go in the trash."
"Stayed here March 22 - 26 on business, and we had such a great time! My office was hosting an event at their restaurant, South Water Kitchen, so we negotiated a deal on the rooms. Since we hosted an event here, the rooms were pretty affordable. My room had an amazing view of the city, and while my colleague's room did not, she got a nice couch to make up for it. I got new shampoos and soaps every single day, regardless of whether or not I was finished with the last one. Also, I asked for a lint roller from the front desk, and I got a huge, full-size one. Nice!Onto the service. Before I even came to the hotel, I was contacted by someone in reservations to ask if we had any special occasion for being there. I mentioned that we were on business but a colleague of mine was retiring this year, and could they do something nice for her room. Upon check-in, my retiring colleague was met with a bottle of wine and some cake. Very nice! Also, I had asked if we could have some of our conference supplies shipped directly to the hotel since the conference storage fees were really excessive. They held on to our supplies for a few days prior to our arrival, no extra charge. Fantastic! Also, everyone I talked to at the front desk and at the wine hour (which was from 5 - 6PM daily) was really nice. They usually say ""Welcome back!"" or ""Have a great day!"" every time you come back or leave the hotel, which is sweet. Matthew at the front desk was our favorite. My colleagues and I had nice long chats with him about the city, places to go eat, life in general, etc. Nice guy. We had a great time at the Hotel Monaco and will likely be back next year!

"I hadn't tried this hotel before but booked it for two after some recent less-than-stellar experiences at other Chicago establishments. We liked the professional treatment, the intriguing decor of the room, and the small luxuries: padded window seats, bathrobes and slippers provided, multiple newspapers as well as tea, coffee, and water available down in the lobby, and complimentary wine hour....

"We stayed here for 6 nights. Would recommend travelers consider this kitschy hotel. The location in the loop and across the river from the Magnificent Mile made it a great place to experience what Chicago has to offer. It has a trendy feel, bold colours and personable staff. The wine reception each night a 5 was an added bonus. The bed was comfortable and floor very quiet. You could hear a low rumble of the ""L"" but we got used to that. We thought it was a very good value given the location. Of course, the was February so maybe this contributed to the reasonable cost."
"My husband and I live in Madison, WI and travel often to Chicago for weekend trips. We have always wanted to stay in this hotel, so when I saw a sale for a weekend we were already planning to go to Chicago, I jumped at the chance to book this hotel. I'm glad I did! It is a beautiful boutique hotel filled with a lot of neat features. I received an e-mail about a week prior to our stay, asking if there were any upgrades I wanted to sign up for (with no guarantee, but it was still neat to see what they had available). When we checked in, we were upgraded to a ""high rise floor."" Our room was beautifully appointed and was... large! I was not expecting that much space for a hotel in downtown Chicago. The rooms also were considered ""tall rooms"" with high ceilings. This was great because my husband and I are both pretty tall (I'm 5'10"" and my husband is 6'3""), and the room even had a very tall shower!The hotel is also pet friendly, which is great. I unfortunately have extreme allergies to cats and was concerned about this. But, I notified the hotel before checking in, and we were placed in a pet-free room (confirmed to me by the hotel manager). I didn't see a single animal on our floor the whole weekend (and saw quite a few in the lobby, so I was pleased to know our room was safe).We ordered room service both mornings and the food was pretty tasty. I really appreciated all the healthy options (i.e. whole grain breads/waffles).The location was great and we had a lovely time! We look forward to visiting again soon!


Room Tip: Look for the ""Stay and Play"" package. We had that and it reduced the valet rate by 50%! I...

"I have been traveling to Chicago on business for years, and I always stay at Monaco. I love the free wine reception in the evening, and the ambiance of the lobby. There is free coffee and tea every morning as well, and I Love that too! The hotel staff and Concierge are awesome! The rooms are very clean and comfortable. My only complaint would be the floor layout...the bathroom doors are very awkward in most of the rooms. When you enter the bathroom the door butts up to toilet, making it a tight fit to get in and out. I have stayed at other hotels in the Loop, but I always come back to Monaco."
"I recently was surprised this past weekend with a nights stay here for my birthday. I was told the room we stayed in was the best in the building, and I wouldn't disagree. The room's amenities included a giant comfy king bed, two televisions (one in the sitting room and one in the bedroom) and deep seated hot tub, and an AMAZING view. Each window is fitted with cushion seat, so you can crawl up into the window and really see everything. The staff was wonderful, I can't count how many people greeted me and told me ""Happy Birthday,"" it was really sweet. There is also a happy hour from 5-6 where they offer free cocktails to their guests. I was seriously impressed with my stay and would recommend it to anyone.

"I am a big fan of Kimpton hotels and this one is one of my favorites. The location is wonderful - central location so you can walk many places and quick access to ""the L"". A horrendous plane trip end caused us to be almost 12 hours late, but a call to the front desk assured us that a room with our preferences would be waiting, and it was. The room itself is pretty basic, though quite comfortable (the pillows are great), but it is the little things that make this hotel. The sitting area in the lobby is inviting, the wine hour at the end of the day is a great way to transition to evening events, and the recommendations by the staff on local places to eat were spot on - in short, great personal service and amenities at a price that is below the big hotels. Throw in free wifi if you join their InTouch program, and this is an outstanding value."
"Room service menu is very limited. I'm staying here a week so this is a problem, it's like being at a local dive in the middle of nowhere. I called for room service at 9pm, was told they'd call me back (7 minutes later and after I got undressed), they did. I tried to order but they closed. It says on their menu they serve dinner until 10pm - but, ""There was nobody in here so we closed it two hours early."" (at 8pm vs. 10pm, as stated on the menu), without warning. They offered to go across the street to get me food at a bar, but I don't eat fried bar food. It's nearly 10pm, no food available and unimpressed. At 9:48pm, I would have been finished with dinner by now and getting ready for bed. Now, I will be up late and have to eat at 10:30pm. Not a good time to eat or way to start the work week. Not a great experience. Bye Kimpton Hotels!"
"the I stayed for four nights on a business trip. The hotel is conveniently located both for Downtown/South Loop and a short walk to the shopping on North Michigan Ave. My room was very nice (1217) - the view was nothing much to write home about, but everything else was great. If you join the InTouch programme you get free internet and a $10 credit for the mini bar. Front desk staff and doorman were on the whole very friendly and provided great service. Wine hour was a nice touch. Two recommendations: a coffee machine in the rooms would be good, without having to ask for it (a machine was provided very promptly when I asked), and when I requested a later check out on the morning of my last day the person to whom I spoke was rather snitty and said I could check out at 3pm for a $50 payment. As it was a Sunday and many people seemed to be checking out I thought that was unreasonable. We ate in the South Water Kitchen restaurant - decor was nothing to write home about and the windows were dirty, but the food was lovely and the service friendly. I will definitely stay at the Monaco if I return to Chicago."
"This is the best hotel at which I have stayed in Chicago. The room was large and comfortable and well decorated. Front desk was efficient and helpful. We checked in before 1 PM and that was no problem. Housekeeping was very efficient. Our room was cleaned before noon on all four days. The doormen were amazing. They had our bags out of the trunk and on the way to the front desk before we were out of the taxi. Same when we were leaving, they took them from us at the desk. Also as it was snowing much of this visit yet they managed to always keep the sidewalk and driveway clear. As with other Kimpton hotels the 5-6 wine hour is the highlight of the day. Good wine, nice snacks and an opportunity to relax in the lobby and meet other guests. I will definitely return next time I visit Chicago."
"I travel 5-15 days per month and stay in my fair share of hotels. However, I always look forward to my trips to Chicago because it's like going home to visit family when I stay at the Hotel Monaco Chicago. The service is outstanding, the rooms are relaxing and comfortable, the staff is extremely friendly and treats you like an MVP every time you're there. If you're a Kimpton Hotel member you get $10 of treats from the mini-bar for free and the free nights add up quickly with the Kimpton In-Touch rewards program.Hotel Monaco Chicago is truly my home-away-from-home!

"Recently stayed at the Monaco and loved everything about it. Location, friendliness of the staff and attentiveness to every detail concerning the needs of their guests. This is my new favorite hotel in the city. Love the spa-like feeling of their atmosphere. I will be back on my next trip to Chicago!

"My husband and I live in the Chicago suburbs but have never spent the night downtown. We had tickets to a show at the Oriental Theatre and knew this was a perfect opportunity to stay in the city. I knew that I wanted to stay in a cool boutique type hotel and my cousin, an event planner in the city, recommended any of the Kimpton Hotels. After reading reviews and the proximity to the theatre we chose the Monaco. After booking the hotel online my husband received an email asking what we were celebrating and if there was anything they could do to make our evening special. My husband responded and the manager upgraded our room to the most AMAZING suite I have ever stayed in!! King room, on the river, 4 gigantic picture windows over looking Wells/Wabash with cushioned window seats complete with throw pillows. And the jacuzzi tub, by far the largest I have ever been in in a hotel. There were a few extra special treats that the hotel staff left for us in our room as well to make our evening extra special. Let me just tell you when I walked into this room my jaw dropped! I had to take pictures and video around the room like a tourist because I had never stayed in a room quite like this before.I may have had a special circumstance type of stay at the Monaco but everything else was great too. The door guys were extremely courteous and willing to assist, check in was quick, easy and done with a smile and the location can not be beat! 5 minutes to theatre/Randolph, 2 minutes to Michigan Ave. wish we had time to have a meal at the South Water Kitchen, the menu looked great!"
"This was a weekend stay that was phenomenal. The hotel staff was nice and I mentioned in my reservation that I was coming for my friend's birthday who lives in the area and that she would be staying with me, when we got to the room there was a birthday card there for her signed by the staff. I thought that was very thoughtful. The room itself was immaculate, I've never seen a hotel room that clean before. The view of the river was also amazing and I have to say my absolute favorite part of the room were the window seats. So cool! Will definitely stay here again."
"Had a great time coming into the city from the suburbs and decided to stay the night at this hotel as part of my birthday weekend celebration. I made reservations and got a really great deal for a one night stay but I did specify that it was a birthday. When we went to Hotel Monaco in Portland they honored my daughter's birthday (requested ahead of time) by having a champagne and 2 glasses in the room, with a wonderful note. My request in Chicago, however, was not honored. But to their defense, I didn't call ahead and ask again. Still nothing was even mentioned at the desk. Would have appreciated a little card or something. OK, it may sound petty, but hey, I'm getting older and I need a little pampering. That was the only disappointing part along with having no turndown service with little chocolates maybe on the bed like some of the other boutique hotels I've traveled to in the past (i watch Hotel Impossible and the little things matter). However, I did enjoy our stay...the hotel is a little art deco and retro and the staff was pleasant. I didn't see any dogs but then again it was 5 degrees and snowy. The South Water Kitchen attached to the hotel had a great brunch that Sunday which we enjoyed with another friend who lived in the city. All in all, great hotel and would definitely stay there again.

"I have never written a review, but the service at this hotel went far beyond what I expected. There were three of us girls in Chicago this weekend for a special time and the weather was very cold with snow. On our first morning, the doorman was not available for a few minutes as we were searching for a taxi. I went up to the front desk to ask about a taxi, and one of the desk clerks told us to keep warm inside. He proceeded to go outside in nothing but his suit...temperature was barely above 0 degrees! He RAN down to the corner to hail a cab...I was so surprised that he would be willing to go to that extreme to find us transportation. Everyone at the Monaco were so helpful and it just made our trip to the big city a wonderful one...our rooms were very nice and clean. For the price, I will never stay in a larger hotel again."
"Just returned from a weekend stay at the Hotel Monaco and can't stop talking about it. This hotel is now our official goto in Chicago. The spacious room was so comfortable, clean and well appointed that we didn't want to leave! Hotel staff was wonderful, particularily Matthew at the front desk and Laura in housekeeping.This hotel is located in a prime spot, steps away from public transportation and major attractions. Don't be fooled by the drab exterior, the interior is first rate. Beautifully decorated from the lobby ""living room"" to the HUGE rooms. We didn't have a view from our room, but we didn't care. Coffee in the morning and drinks in the evening are one of the nice perks that give this hotel a true boutique vibe. The staff was courtous, personable and professional. We cannot wait to stay here again!"
"My daughter had a work event in Chicago the first week in February, and we decided to stay on a few days to see the city and have some girl time. We loved the Monaco! The staff is fabulous. Every request was met with a smile, and handled quickly. The room was clean and comfortable, and oh! those windows! Not once during the week did we hear any sounds from outside the room. The hotel is set up so that many of the rooms are away from the main hallway on the floor, which contributes to the feeling of privacy. My daughter arrived a few days before I did. On her first night she noticed her allergies were acting up, and thought it was possibly caused by a previous occupant's pet. There was no evidence at all of a dog having been in the room - no pet hair, no odor, nothing, but she hoped that a room change would help - and it did. The room change was made with no problem at all, and the staff at the front desk was genuinely concerned and wanted to make it right. The only suggestion I would have about that is to make sure any extras from the first room are included in the second. When settling into the original room she had requested an extra comforter for the window seat, and a set of drawers to hold clothes during our extended stay. These items were not added when the move was made. It was easy enough to request them again, but we definitely would have felt much more taken care of had we not had to ask. A rather small thing to notice in an otherwise wonderful week. Of special note are the doormen here. Jorge, Michael, and Peter are so welcoming and friendly. Also noteworthy was Mike at the front desk. I happened to be in the lobby when Mike had to deal with an uncomfortable situation, and was so impressed with his ability to defuse it instead of allowing it to escalate. Kudos. One thing I think is important to point out - pay attention to the list in your room of items the hotel will be happy to provide you at no cost. We requested a coffee maker, and were brought a Keurig with enough K-cups for 4 cups. The K cup supply was replenished daily without having to ask. As mentioned earlier, they also have little 3 or 4 drawer units (think Ikea) for clothing. Without these, there really wasn't enough drawer space for a week's worth of clothing, so make sure you request them if needed. They also offer humidifiers, which can be great when the heat is being used. All of these things can help make the difference between a good stay and a great one!All in all, my daughter and I had a great week, and I feel like the Hotel Monaco is now ""my"" hotel in Chicago. In fact, I can't wait to visit others in the Kimpton chain in other cities!

"Stayed 3 nights at Hotel Monaco in Chicago. Love this place. From the complementary wine 5:00 - 6:00 daily, knowledgable staff, clean & comfortable attractive room, wi-fi, good coffee every morning, thick towels, cute robes, quality bathroom lotion & shampoo to $10 to raid the bar. Plus we had and early flight and thought we were just leaving our bags so we could visit a museum but were checked in to our room several hours early at no charge. The location is central to shopping, sites and public transportation. Want to go back!"
Well situated in downtown Chicago; easy to access via public transportation from either O'Hare or Midway airports. Only a short walk from the Magnificent Mile. Plenty of places to dine nearby for every budget. Rooms were much better appointed than other hotels family and friends stayed at while attending a wedding. Last minute rates were much better and rooms larger than other hotels in the River North area. Definitely put it on your list when visiting Chicago.
"There must be many wonderful hotels in Chicago, yet I continue to stay only at the Hotel Monaco. The location is excellent - close to Magnificent Mile, Art Institute, Grant Park, and great restaurants. The rooms are clean and the beds are very comfortable. Ask to have a room with a river view. The best aspect of the hotel are the staff - they are friendly, professional, and knowledgable about the area. I had to mix work with a pleasure trip so was up early every morning and wen town to the lobby with my computer. The gentleman working always ensured I had a cup of tea even though it was far too early for the morning beverage service. The bellhops, the front desk staff, and the housekeeping staff all genuinely care that you have an excellent stay at the hotel. The wine hour offers an unique opportunity to meet other guests."
"I kidnapped my husband to Chicago for our 30th Anniversary, and Hotel Monaco helped make it a wonderful weekend! The wine hour was Super! The staff were so courteous and helpful, including delaying delivery of a cheese/fruit/wine tray gift from family when our Amtrak train was verrry late.Adjacent restaurant ""South Water Kitchen"" provided an excellent breakfast . . . didn't eat other meals there, but bet they would be good too based on menu!

"A good friend of mine was meeting me in Chicago so we could celebrate both our birthdays. Since I had stayed at The Hotel Monaco Chicago once before, with my college age sons, I choose to stay here again!! Upon early arrival, our room was ready and the staff surprised us with designer birthday cupcakes and a card signed by the whole staff!!This is family, friend, and animal friendly (no size or weight restrictions) hotel, so bring your furry friend (they stay free of charge)!! This ""boutique"" hotel is luxurious, to say the least, as well as extremely clean, quiet, beautifully renovated and the beds sport ultra-luxurious linens (triple-sheeted bed) complete with a plush top for a unbelievable good night's sleep; and, oh, the fabulous amenities. . . Many rooms have these fabulous window nooks to catch views of the Chicago River or even nap. You can choose to wake up to complimentary morning coffee and tea service in the lobby Living Room and/or wind down every evening at the hosted evening wine hour. Of course, it is a AAA Four Diamond Award winner. You can tour the city on a Segway, and borrow one of the Flip Video cameras to record your favorite things.Of course,The Monaco usually has a great rate for Intouch members (their free membership program - be sure to sign up)! The only down-side is the cost of valet parking - This garage facility is an outside service operated by Park One Chicago at a nightly rate of $56 with in and out privileges throughout your stay."
"Stayed at the Monaco for a weekend close to Christmas with my wife. It has a great location close to anything that you want to walk to. The staff were quite helpful and we really liked the feel and decor of the hotel. Some of the best things: the window seat where you can relax and look out over the Chicago river. Also the companion goldfish they give you for the length of your stay. Cool! Free coffee, newspaper and some other things just made the hotel a nice place to stay. Would go back except we always like trying new things."
"The Monaco has a great location that makes it walkable to great shopping and good food. The service was spectacular as you'd expect from a Kimpton hotel. The rooms are older, but classy, comfortable, and great for business or pleasure.I was lucky enough to get upgraded to a corner suite. The view was spectacular. There's pillows and a cushioned surface in the oversized windows that creates a cozy place to read, work, and relax.Make sure you look at the promotions on the hotel website. I got a fantastic deal that included a $50 gift card and coupons to local shops for basically the same price as the room when not looking under the promotions tab."
"Their brochure supposedly shows a king deluxe room with a gorgeous view down the Chicago River. Well... no. If you are willing to crawl (literally) into a narrow window well that is three or four feet deep and scrunch up against the glass you can see what they advertised. However, if you just want to look out your little window you see the Christian Science Headquarters but no river. I asked to move but they said that none of the rooms except maybe a suite had a better view. They were nice and gave me my room at the non-view price but I would much rather have had the view. As it is the hotel is just another downtown hotel... there is just nothing special about it. On my return I booked at the Radisson Blu. The staff isn't as good but it's a much more interesting stay. My inquires to Kimpton's InTouch loyalty group have gone unanswered.


Room Tip: If you can afford a suite it would help. Otherwise just get the cheapest price room.

"Great boutique hotel in a wonderful location! We had a beautiful view on the 14th floor. I loved sitting in the wondow seat watching the snow fall! For our twenty year wedding anniversary they left a card with two water bottles. We appreciated the gesture, but water? In the bathroom large pieces of grout were coming out of the tile floor. After our first night we mentioned this to the front desk, we thought they might move us to another room, but that was not offered. The beds were very comfortable and warm. I would recommend the Monaco to friends traveling to Chicago."
"Went for a weekend getaway and can not say enough good things. whenever we had interaction with staff in the hotel or the South Water Kitchen they were extremely pleasant and asked relevant questions. Then they actually listened to your reply. The door man went above and beyond to hail cabs from the corner. He also asked conversational questions like where you were eating then on your return would ask how it was. We will be sure to visit again and if this is a representation of Kimpton Hotels We will look for them when we stay in other cities also.


Room Tip: The window seats in the mediterranean River suite are large enough to sleep in.

"Upon arrival, the lobby was very nice and clean. Our room was a bit dusty.  There was a thick line of dust at the top of the headboard. We opted to upgrade, although not realizing that the upgrade would make us from 2 queens to 1 king and a sofa bed! The sofa bed was awful---- when I called the...

"We were taken by surprise how good and friendly the Sofitel was during our stay this month. Brilliant rooms, with the most comfortable beds, great atmosphere and friendly staff who would bend over backwards to help just made the stay even better. A brilliant locations just off the magnificent mile and near Macys we will definitely stay there again.

Green Features: super, very eco friendly and superb candle display in the evenings"
"I'd always wanted to stay at this hotel and through a third party website I got lucky. Everything is very nice from the moment you walk into the lobby. Staff at the desk was very friendly. Room was not over sized, but big enough for a weekend getaway. Bed was as comfortable as any I've slept in anywhere. We had an amazing view of the city too. There is a mini bar in the room and it is on a sensor program so they know what you take out. First time I've ever experienced that. There is a parking garage right around the corner on State Street. IF you download the spot hero app you can usually get it for $34 for 24 hours...otherwise it's going to be about $70 if you just show up and pay to park."
"I visit Chicago quite frequently (maybe once every month or 2) and this was my first, but not likely my last, stay at the Sofitel. First off, we got a great deal on the room from Priceline and then an upgrade to a Luxury King upon arrival. The staff are all very pleasant, professional, and friendly. The room was very clean and nicely decorated with a comfy bed. The bathroom was large and included both a shower and tub with plenty of water pressure and hot water. We couldn't hear any noise from our neighbors which was also a big plus and I find that to be more often a problem. The mini fridge was fully stocked- be aware that it is on a weight system and if you remove anything from the fridge (even if you put it back) it will be charged to you if you don't clarify upon check out. We tried to make room for our leftovers and ran into this but they happily removed the charges when we explained the situation. Location is central with the train, shops, and restaurants all nearby. The bar off the lobby was a great place for a nightcap too.

"I took my wife to Chicago to celebrate her birthday. I liked all of the reminders leading up to our visit from the hotel. They even let us put our name on a waiting list for a possible upgrade to a suite at check-in. Unfortunately, that didn't happen. I would have liked to have seen the difference in space in the suite and the room we had. The room wasn't bad. It was actually nice. I had built up in my head based on the reviews that this would be a knockout hotel. Like I said It was a very nice hotel, but not what I expected. The lobby is a little small, and our room was smaller than expected. The view was nice. we were on the 31st floor. The room didn't have a fridge, but I think from a follow up email that one could be requested. The room was very modern and very clean. The bathroom was very, very nice. It had a tub with whirlpool jets and a separate shower. It was very spacious. One of the best parts of the room was bed. It was probably one of the top 3 beds I have ever slept in in a hotel. We had a great nights sleep and like I said, the bed was great. The complimentary Wi-Fi in the room was also a nice plus.All of the staff from the front desk, to the maid who helped me were all very nice and helpful. If our room had been bigger then I might have given this a 5 rating. If the price were right then I would definitely stay here again.


Room Tip: Higher floors have great views.

"I am in Chicago annually for business and usually stay closer to the hustle and bustle of North Michigan Ave near the river.
This time a colleague (and Chicago business trip veteran) suggested the Sofitel Water Tower. Great choice! Very European. Great service. Elegant lobby, restaurant, and bar scene.
Spacious rooms, super comfortable bed, great bathroom.

"I really enjoyed my brief stay at the Sofitel. It was a unique experience. Given its French ownership, it has a different feel about it. Very upscale, without being stiff or overdone.

Spotlessly clean and well cared-for.  The hotel itself was lovely and the food and service excellent."

"We looked for a reasonably-priced place to stay in the heart of the city the week before Christmas. We were surprised that the Sofitel was very reasonable so close to the holiday. We did look around and there were others at the same price or a little less, but for the quality and location this could not be beat. Each staff member we came into contact with was friendly and professional. The lobby always smelled nice. In general there was a European feel to the property. We enjoyed a couple nice evenings in the lobby bar, one near the fireplace. The location is really great. About a block to Michigan Ave including the Hancock Building and Water Tower Place. There is a Walgreens and a market just around the corner, which is convenient for snacks and water. Basically right on Rush street just down from the ""Viagra Triangle."" Plenty of restaurant options in easy walking distance, including McCormick and Schmick's, Gibsons, Hugo's, Carmines, Morton's, Ditka's, Epic Burger, Lou Malnati's, Tavern on Rush, etc. Great shopping in the area and very short Uber rides to most things.The room was a standard size (single King bed) but definitely adequate for two and the bathroom was plenty large. Some areas were showing a little wear but the cleanliness could not be faulted and was much better than some upper-end chains. The view facing east was spectacular - a very nice view of the Hancock building perfectly framed by two other high-rises. Great view down upon the St. James Chapel.I used the workout facilities and while not huge, it was never very busy and they actually had free weights along with the normal treadmills, bikes, and Precor-type gliders. It will work for all but the hardcore fitness people. There was no extra charge for the gym. There was always water and fruit available.It also looked like they had nice meeting rooms (some with pretty great views) and there was one wedding and reception on site while we were there.We did not have a car, and I am happy we didn't because the parking was $65 per night.If you are unfamiliar with Chicago, one non-hotel related tip is to absolutely download and use the ride-share services such as Uber because they are less expensive and friendlier than any taxi cab driver we have ever encountered. Plus they do not talk on the phone constantly, your credit card payment is automatic and includes the tip. Chicago cab drivers leave a lot to be desired. Never again, if I can help it. I would stay at the Sofitel again and recommend this property.

"The lobby of this Sofitel is gorgeous and the room has a comfortable and colorful decor. The bathroom is by far the highlight of the Sofitel experience. There is a large tub, glass shower, and huge counter in the bathroom. My bed was uncomfortably soft. It sunk down as soon as sat on the bed and it didn't provide back support. Last month I stayed at the Sofitel in Washington, D.C. and my bed there was so comfortable, 6 hours of sleep felt like 9 hours. Not here in Chicago. Hotel is located towards the northwest side of the Gold Coast. It is also a bit out of the way of restaurants and shops."
"The staff was very friendly and helpful. Check in a breeze. The lobby was very elegant and the bar, Le Bar very cozy and comfortable. The location also a plus. Walking distance to many great restaurants too. We found inexpensive parking a block away using an app called park whiz. $25 per day. The rooms were very clean. And comfortable. We had a luxury king so not sure the difference with a lesser choice but if this room is typical which I think it is, you won't be disappointed. You can tell that this is a newer luxury hotel. Didn't eat in the restaurant but according to some reviews I've read it is very nice. We stayed 2 nights and would definitely stay here again!"
"We have been going to this hotel over the Christmas break on and off for about 7 years. The hospitality in this hotel is first rate. All of the staff are extremely accommodating and offered us complimentary upgrades and wine at the bar. Very cool exhibit of photographs of Picasso and other notable french artists in the lobby as a temporary display that is being passed around the Sofitel chain. The Sofitel does an excellent job promoting French culture in the US with its French magazines in the rooms and lobbies and complimentary copies of Le Monde. Location is great, just a block from the magnificent mile. The values of the room (at least during the Christmas break) are excellent, and our room even had its own nespresso machine. Bed is very comfortable, and amazing views from the higher floors. Most of the hotel is in great shape; furniture that I recall was worn the last time we were there a few years back has been replaced and our room showed no signs of aging. One change that is required is there needs to be an update to the gym. When we first came to the hotel years ago I remembered the gym being excellent. Now, however, compared to Sheratons for example, the gym seems small and outdated, with old equipment and not the same attention to detail as the rest of the hotel. By 8:30 a.m or so the gym was very crowded, and it does not help that the hotel stuffs treadmills and ellipticals into a very small space. Still love this hotel, and enjoyed being there, but a new and improved gym will make this place the absolute best value around. However, when it comes to character and service, I still think the Sofitel is top notch. Add a great location, and it is difficult to beat, except for the gym.

"Stayed at the Sofitel Dec 21-27th to spend the holidays with our adult children. Perfect location, wonderful room with lovely bathroom and comfy bed. The room was very clean which is super important to me. Was able to get a very good deal on a nonrefundable offer which included breakfast for two each morning. Restaurant was well run and the food was delicious. We found all the staff to be incredibly helpful and friendly. Loved our stay at the Sofitel and look forward to our next adventure there.

"This was one of two hotels recommended by the trip organizers. The access to the Red Line, un peu de la francophonie chez les illinoisiens, reasonable room rates, and my membership in Le Club Accorhotels were what tipped the balance for us. The welcome at reception was excellent. Having reserved at what I think was the medium category, we were upgraded to two rooms (our adult daughter took the second room) on the 30th floor of this 32 story hotel -- I don't think I have ever slept at so high a level. Elevator service was excellent. A strange feature of the bathroom is the double doors opening onto the hall. The hallway is a bit narrow, but a single full size door would have fitted there. The double doors are just inconvenient. I guess what has to take a bit of the French technocrat along with the beauty of this 412 room 1998 hotel. The bathroom has both a stall shower with no floor mat and a tub with a wand. While some documentation in the hotel room speaks of expensive wifi payable FOR EACH DEVICE, the actual setup is that a light version adequate for email and basic surfing is free. For more, one must pay. We had a total of seven devices for the three of us and apparently did not exceed the limit on any device. Our room faced southwest. This meant we faced nothing but a landscape punctuated by undistinguished high rises. Right across E Chestnut Street up to the corner of State Street an even taller high rise is under construction (even on Sunday). This provided us with an interesting show of brightly clothed workers doing all kinds of tasks with safety lines attached, construction elevators, and construction cranes. Lighting in the room was good and easily controlled. The minibar has absolutely no space for storing our own snacks, such as fresh fruit, milk, or yogurt. The Keurig single cup coffee maker is a strange device. Unless things are done in exactly the correct order nothing happens. The coffee service provides two daily paper cups, coffee capsules (reg & decaf), sugar, sweeteners, powdered creamer (why no UHT capsules?), and NO STIR STICKS. The bed was very comfortable. The hotel has a modern TV and radio, but we used neither.


Room Tip: Our room on the southwest faced an even taller building under construction 7 days.

Two night stay the weekend prior to Christmas - very busy time for Chicago! Hotel staff was very pleasant and helpful. We requested a change of the feather duvet & pillows after we arrived at the room (we had forgotten to request this earlier) and it was taken care of promptly. The room was exceptionally quiet at night which allowed for uninterrupted sleep. Note: your room key and WiFi access are discontinued the morning of your scheduled departure prior to your checkout. We had to request a key be reactivated at the front desk as we had to reclaim our vehicle from a nearby garage before loading the luggage.
"We've stayed in a lot of hotels in Chicago over the years--and after five nights here we now think Sofitel is the best of them. First impressions count a lot--a front desk staffer named Michael helped us out a lot when we checked in after midnight, securing us a room with a perfect location, and we really felt at home. There are a lot of little things that distinguish this Softel--the Nespresso in the rooms, the housekeeping that came several times each day, the welcome drinks, the impeccable room appearance and perfect beds. We had drinks at their bar as well, and their bartender knows his craft! Overall, it added up to a feel that we were staying in a top-notch hotel. They work hard on their service here, and it really shows. If I could pick a room at the Drake or one at the Sofitel, I'd stay here. It's a beautiful hotel in a perfect location, and we will come again."
"We've stayed at Sofitel Chicago Water Tower 3 times and have had no complaints prior to this weekend. We love the location and for the most part the staff is very friendly.We booked a king sized bed but were surprised that our bed was not a King as we've had before. We were told it was a hotel King. Frankly, that's a new one on me.Our room was incredibly noisy as well. Mechanical sounds coming from behind the wall both nights limiting our ability to sleep.When we discussed this issue with the front desk attendant, he responded with a flat affect that we would get a different room next time. Unacceptable response delivered in an unacceptable manner. Will not return."
"Stayed here the Friday after Thanksgiving with the whole family, four rooms and a dog. Front desk staff was great at check in very friendly and professional.Rooms were clean, modern but a little small when comparing them to some of the older hotels in Chicago. Location is fantastic as it is two blocks from Michigan Avenue and is adjacent to many great restaurants and shops. I would stay out of the bar as the drinks are over priced and cost me a small fortune for a round. Overall a very positive stay and I will be back in the future!"
"Located at the north end of the Magnificent Mile, just a block west of Water Tower Place, this hotel is located within easy walking distance of so many downtown destinations. The rooms are very clean and comfortable with wonderful beds and pillows. The bathrooms are beautiful, very large and well-appointed. The staff was very friendly and most helpful. If you're arriving by car, leave your car in the hotel parking lot and either walk or take taxis (which are very reasonably priced) anywhere downtown. Parking rates are exorbitant.

If you are are thinking of going to the Willis tower and John Hancock, I would recommend doing the Willis tower by day and just head up to the lounge in the John Hancock to have a drink at night. The nighttime views are stunning."
"We have visited Chicago many times throughout the years, and this was by far our most pleasant stay. The location can't be beat, being on the south end of the Gold Coast, and just a block and a half from Michigan Ave. Everything we did was so close, yet we were far enough off the main traffic to enjoy the street life without crowds. Plenty of taxis were always available, and the walk to the train line if we were in the mood, was easily accessible. I love Chicago, and the warm, friendly, no-nonsense culture of Chicago is well represented by the hotel. The staff were all warm and friendly, from the doorman and concierge to the front desk and the restaurant. This is our new ""go to"" hotel when we stay in Chicago.

"Typically friendly Sofitel, particularly good concierge service. Rooms are comfortable (and quiet for Chicago), we were on the 31st Floor, the large bed was particularly comfortable. Turn left 1 block your at the bottom of the Magnificent Mile opposite the 360 View, ( John Hancock Tower). 2 blocks from the rear of the hotel your in the best restaurant district, try Gibsons, great steaks. Late bar with snacks was a welcome return to the hotel after exploring the nightlife. Highly recommended"
"Beautiful hotel in a very high end part of Chicago, but compared to others in the area, great value! Employees from all over the world and all of them were professional and friendly. In town for a Cubs game and getting to the stadium was very easy using the train, only about 2 blocks from the Sofitel. They provide a very clear card with directions on how to get there and back...and more importantly, which trains to use. Wonderful shops and restaurants around the corner. Valet parking was pricey, but I needed a very secure spot since I was traveling with a lot...excellent choice!!"
"Just spend five nights in a very nice suite at the Sofitel Water Tower.Great location, interesting architecture, good service.However, two minus points:- the free internet connection (hey, it's a suite!) never worked in a satisfying way. Needed to buy the fee-based connection to get a decent speed.- Officially ""The Bar"" is open until 1 AM. Coming back from a dinner to have one last drink ""for the road"" at 0.45 AM. Got thrown out in a rude way because last orders have already been taken.Therefore three stars only."
"A frequent traveler (all over the world) ... have stayed in everything from chain hotels, bed/breakfast, boutique hotels to high-end luxury.

"We could not pull up to unload/valet park, there was too much traffic and about 3 cars deep already by the entrance. Instead of circling the block several times in the hopes of getting in, we opted to park in the garage which wasn't convenient at all. Had to drag bags through garage to elevator and then down the block outside to the hotel. Checking in was fine...elevator was extremely small and slooowwww. Room was fine, no big whoop, too much furniture in the way. Asian/European modern, not my taste. One negative was that the room wouldn't stay cold enough...fan mode wouldn't stay on. Every time the fan shut off it felt warm and stuffy. The bathroom had water spots??? on the floor and some long dark hair, maybe the maids???The biggest draw back for me was the bed...IT WAS LIKE SLEEPING ON A ROCK!!! I had a migraine for the next three days because it hurt my neck and back soooo bad. We didn't order room service or eat at the restaurant downstairs...menu did not appeal to us in the slightest. We did walk down the block to a cafe we passed on the way in and had an early dinner and returned the next morning for breakfast.Overall, not our cup of tea so to speak...we'll leave this hotel for the European travelers to enjoy."
"The hotel was simply (almost) excellent, from the registration process to our departure. The lobby is very nicely appointed, we had delicious dinner and breakfast at the restaurant, the room was spic-and-span clean and very comfortable, the bathroom was big and convenient, the location is excellent, within walking distance from the Water Tower Center and the Golden Mile (shopping, shopping,...

"I stayed with my family for the 5th time in this wonderful property, and this stay is our best so far.The service is better and faster (it would be nicer if one would be able to speak to various departments without having to go through guest services first :) ).You cannot beat the location of this hotel; walking distance from restaurants, attraction and shopping.We stayed at the corner prestige suite, which was modern, spacious, well lit and with all the amenities you would expect from a luxury hotel.The hotel staff were all very courteous and professional. I would like to particularly mention the front desk staff that we dealt with, namely Maurice and Michael were extremely helpful, friendly and welcoming. They made our check in and checkout a breeze.The breakfast and service at the Cafe de Architectes were very good. There were wide selections for breakfast in the menu, including some tasty french pastries. Room service is also very good.This hotel is a very good ""all rounder,"" with a modern look and excellent amenities.We are looking forward to our next stay.


Room Tip: I prefer the corner prestige suite

"I was traveling to Chicago for a wedding with my wife and 5 month old daughter. The Sofitel made me feel like a member of royalty. They were very accommodating to our every need. Not only did they set up a crib, with sheets, they put an extra refrigerator in our room when they heard we had formula that needed to be kept cold. That's right, I didn't even ask them for the refrigerator, they just added it to our room. I will definitely recommend this hotel to anyone who asks me where they should stay in Chicago."
"My husband and I stay at this hotel every single time we come to Chicago (2-3 times per year) and we have never been disappointed. The beds are comfortable, the views are awesome, room service food is yummy, everything is clean, the bathrooms are HUGE, and the staff is super pleasant. What more could you want? Oh yeah, the price is REALLY low for the quality!

"I was traveling to Chicago on business over a weekend and needed a hotel. My usual spot was booked, so I started looking around at the excellent choices in the Water Tower neighborhood. I landed on the Sofitel due to positive experiences at Sofitel properties in Philly and Strasbourg France.I booked a standard king room for this trip and didn't expect any special treatment because I'm not elite with the Accor loyalty program. Check-in was seamless and the staff were professional. The hotel layout is a central core of elevators in a triangular shaped building. The room was spacious for a standard room. The layout of the room was what I'd call ""typical"" but the bathroom was very large. Lots of electrical outlets, comfortable desk chair and arm chair. The bed was extremely comfortable as well. The bathroom was large, with plenty of counter space and water pressure. Overall, the room would work for 2 people (i.e. a couple). The decor was modern and bright and more luxurious than many hotels in the area (and I've stayed at virtually all of them)> The neighborhood (the hotel is basically at Chestnut and Rush) is great for most business needs and is an excellent location for leisure activities as well. The public areas of the hotel were decent (though the lobby was more set up for check-in and transit vs. meetings or relaxing). The bar was quite nice with an outdoor seating area. Most of the clientele were tourists. Since know Chicago well, I didn't make use of the Concierge. Compared to some of the larger properties (Hyatt Regency, InterContinental etc), the place is quite which is nice. Overall, I'd recommend the Sofitel for a visit to Chicago for either business or leisure."
"A perfect orchestration of staff, location, architecture, service elevating hospitality to an art form. This is a most amazing establishment. Though this is a large luxury hotel in the Gold Coast area of Chicago, it had the same charm and personality as their quaint Hotel Mercure Paris La Sorbonne I visited last year in Paris. The Sofitel Chicago Water Tower is everything you would want in a hotel, but would be surprised to find in one establishment.


Room Tip: Just ask. The staff is very genuine and honest.

"I spent 4 nights at the Sofitel Water Tower Chicago. Just about everything about the stay was great. The staff was courteous, professional and extremely helpful and friendly. Room was quite deluxe. 4 stars because the bed wasn't quite up to what I expected. Nothing really terrible-just not quite like the Westin beds. I didn't eat in the restaurants so I can't comment on the food. The location was extremely convenient-just 2 short blocks off Michigan Ave. Concierge was super helpful. I'd stay there again.

"Nice hotel. Sitting areas in lobby. Cafe/bar located there. Decent sized room. Downside, is there aren't any vending machines, so plan accordingly. We did have a fridge in room. Parking is valet, and is $62 a night. We parked a few blocks away, but still paid $44. There is a rooftop bar called 52 Eighty. Smaller than anticipated. Outdoor area wasn't opened yet. Location is what makes this hotel."
"We arrived early and the room was ready. It was very nicely decorated and clean. The lobby was also clean and nicely decorated - modern. We were on the 7th floor. It was quiet and we liked the view from our window. Would ask for same room next visit! Pillows were real nice after walking all day in Chicago.The bathroom was very clean, shampoo, soap was real nice, and the shower was huge.This hotel is next to Ginos pizza, which was excellent.

"I booked this hotel on a ""bait and switch"" deal that Hotwire offered in it's ""Secret Hot Rate Hotel"" category. After listing four guests for our reservation, Hotwire shows six quality name brand four star hotels then in small print mentions you could also get an independent or boutique hotel. I put two adults and two children in the drop down tabs to make sure we received a room big enough to accomodate my family. After finding out my secret hotel was ""MileNorth,"" I panic and look up reviews for this hotel since I've never heard of it. (I have stayed in Chicago over a dozen times and literally have never seen this hotel.) There were so many issues reviewed that I tried to get my hotel changed to a major chain, since Hotwire declined I decided to take a chance and see for myselft. Upon arrival a very pleasant door man gave me directions on where to park. Milenorth uses a self park lot across the street that is shared with Northwestern Hospital. (24 hours of parking was $53.) We entered the hotel lobby which was clean and very trendy looking. We check in and find out that HOTWIRE guarantees a double occupancy only for the secret hot rate. (Check their website and you won't see any mention of this). Not to worry, Christopher at the desk gladly helps us out and gives us a junior suite on the 8th floor for our trouble. When we get up to our room we are pleasantly surprised that it's nice and clean and has lots of space for our family. The bathroom was clean but dated and there was a slight issue with the lock on our door, which my teenage son was able to take care of. The bed was a lovely soft cloud with a fluffy down comforter that was truely a treat after walking Michigan Avenue all day! The sofa bed was standard and the teenagers were just fine on it. Our T.V. didn't work in our room so the kids used the free wi-fi. When we mentioned to the desk about the T.V. upon check out, they promptly gave us free drink coupons to use that morning. We grabbed a Starbucks on our way out of the hotel with a big smile on our faces. Location: 5 Stars, Room appearance: 4 stars, Staff: 5 stars."
"Veteran Chicago visitor but first time at this hotel. Great location a block East of Michigan Ave in the heart of the Water Tower area. Staff was attentive on checkin. No motor lobby so loading/unloading is a bit of a strain. Particularly so for us with two dogs. We stay at a lot of Kimpton hotels as they all accept pets. The pet fee of $75 per dog is a bit salty at this one though. This was a short stay so did not have the opportunity to take in the amenities of the hotel. Had a cocktail in the inviting lobby bar. generous and well crafted. We rented a king suite which had a nice seating area with additional TV. Bathroom very modern. Lighting very ""W"" style. I would stay here again.

"We stayed 5 nights in March- we were impressed with all elements of the hotel. The room was large and comfortable, staff were excellent (especially Joel) and as mentioned elsewhere, the location was perfect for sightseeing and shopping. Starbucks in the hotel was handy for a quick morning coffee and the bar staff were friendly (as were the front desk). We couldn't fault it at all, and recommend it to anyone staying in Chicago."
"MileNorth is in an amazing location. It is directly beside one of the best rated deep dish pizza places in Chicago - Gino's (be aware if going for pizza that it takes them 45 minutes at least to prepare). The hotel is also just one block off of the Magnificent Mile with loads of upscale shopping available and within short walking distance to the famous Chicago Water Tower. The MileNorth itself is a neat boutique-feel hotel. It offered probably one of the most comfy hotel beds I've ever slept in - with nice plump pillows and a great duvet. I loved the ""green"" option of putting a card on the door stating you didn't require maid service the next day and receiving a $5 credit to use at the on-site small restaurant. The staff was accommodating and friendly. A very pleasant surprise was the wifi that was available free of charge. The only disappointing part was that the bar and restaurant at the top of the building was undergoing renovation and wouldn't be open until the beginning of April. But there were plenty of alternatives available in the neighbourhood including a small lounge area in the lobby that had an awesome flamenco guitarist playing one night. You can tell that there have been a lot of upgrades done to the interior recently to make it up-to-date. I wouldn't hesitate to stay here again the next time I'm in town.

"We stayed here for one night on Saturday, 3/14 and really enjoyed our stay at this great location. The front desk was kind enough to let us check in early, to drop off our bags. The room was clean, updated, and very comfortable. Great bed, comfortable linens. We also enjoyed a nightcap in the lobby and heard a fantastic young man play the heck out of his guitar! Flamenco, I believe. The hotel lobby was very aesthetically appealing and comfortable. I would definitely; stay here again. The only bad thing was that there was alot of noise from 2am - 6am, people partying in the hall, slamming doors, etc....I would have called the desk to complain but kept hoping they would settle do\wn."
"We stayed here for the dying of the river 2015 for 2 night in March. The hotel offered a great location and was literally steps away from Michigan Avenue. The hotel was clean with a modern look. More of a boutique venue as it is not large and generic but rather small, tasteful and comfy. Check in/check out was fast and efficient. The rooms are a fair size for a city hotel. Bedding was white hotel variety but room was clean and tastefully decorated. Fantastic wall paper in both the room and bathroom. The shower offered body scrub shampoo and conditioner dispensed in the shower. Those were the only amenities offered. We did have a fridge but it was never fully engaged even when turning up to coldest. There was an iron and blow dryer, my blow dryer was subpar but did the trick. The bathroom lacks Vents or a fan- this is about the only negative. The entire hotel was overly warm but it is in between season which is a difficult time to monitor temp, one minute you need the air next the heat. Elevators very small and very slow. This May be due to the fact there are too many people for the 2 in operation for floors above 7....5 people max in each or you are touching. Most people opted to wait rather than feel overcrowded. They had a very nice bar/reception/lounge area. This area offered small eats, drinks and coffee. There was a nice acoustic performance on the Saturday we were there. Valet parking is 62.00 but the parking garage is across the street...steps away. For 10.00 per day it is easy to unload and then park yourself for 52.00 and the 52.00 is in line with parking everywhere in the city. The coffee prices were reasonable 2.65 for a large regular. The drinks were comparable to every where else we visited. Mixed drinks about 10.00 each and beer at 6.00 7.00 each. If prices are reasonable compared to other hotels in the area, next time we visit Chicago I will book this place again."
"We spent 3 nights at MileNorth hotel in September 2014. This hotel clearly exceeded our expectations. It's located in the city center, very stylishly designed, with spacious rooms. A separate attraction is a bar on top of the building with great panorama, especially at night. Yet breakfasts were not included.While both check-in and check-out were a bit messy for us, we still give it a 5-star rating thanks to the attitude of a waitress in a roof-bar, who offered a free drink in return for the one I spilled from the table. This is a small thing but it makes a difference."
"I could not have been more pleased with our experience at MNH. We were there for my daughter's wedding and the staff was amazing from reservations to check out! We had to increase the room block several times and always easily and without incident. I might add that Chicago was having a very big convention that weekend and we were still treated like the most important reservations they had. The bell service was like none I have ever experienced. Henry got our large group settled and cars for events so smoothly we felt as though we were VIP's. Il will definitely stay here again when I stay downtown and have recommended it to many people already.


Room Tip: Saw many of the rooms as we were a large party and all were large sunny and quiet.

"This was a Groupon deal. This hotel is very environmentally friendly. Recycled products and the choice to re-use our towels and sheets to decrease our footprint. Our suite was so big and pretty. Two free wi-fi, 2 hd t.v.s, a living room, bedroom, and a huge bathroom. The shower is large and has a water-fall feel to it. Although we couldn't get room service late at night, we called Gino's Pizza across the street to deliver us pizza, sandwiches and pop. Our room had an awesome view of Downtown Chicago. We were close to many stores and restaurants. Our room was quiet, the bed was comfortable, staff was helpful, and we will be going back!

The hotel was bustling with activity...so apparently others know of his greatness as well. This is a modern hotel with all the amenities you could want...including a Starbucks in the lobby! :) Great location with close proximity to Michigan Ave and all the great shopping along with many popular local restaurant favorites. I travel monthly around the country for work and have stayed at many different levels and brands of hotels...you wont regret choosing the MileNorth.
"We came for a hospital visit but did some shopping and eating. Being at the top of michigan avenue makes it perfect for a loop of shopping . Clean modern and very roomy throughout.! . A much better layout than the usual hotel room . I love that the bathroom entry is away from the sleeping area. And theyve done away with the ridiculous bathtub! The bathroom is bigger than the usual. Big enough for two to be in at the same time. The shower is spacious and has a good shower head. Clearly im a bathroom person! But the bedroom is bigger too. A nice big window , lots of light . There arent a lot of services other than a coffee bar and regular bar , but the location is perfect for shopping, eating and i highly reccommend for people visiting the northwestern hospital campus. Love the simple modern feel."

"Well, yes that is possible, but you have to get it yourself as there is NO room service at this hotel. I was disappointed knowing that I couldn't be lazy in my bed and order room service. If you are looking for something to eat from the hotel, you must go to the bar area which is just to the left of the check-in desk and you can order food-to-go from the bar menu and either wait for it downstairs at the bar while it's being prepared or go back upstairs to your room and then someone will call you to come back down, which is a shame, because the rooms are very nice and large, and the bed is oh so comfy!! If i'm in my jammies, I don't want to have to go back downstairs for anything!!"
"The hotel is in a great location, a 1/2 block of the Magnificent Mile. I signed up for a special package that was 40% off their normal rates. When I called direct for reservations I had to direct the reservations person I was talking to their web site, she was not aware of the 40% off rate. I upgraded to a ""City View"". What we got was a view of the parking structure across the street. When I questioned the front desk I was told this was a ""City View"". The staff did not seem very interested in my concern. The room was ok. It was in need of an update. The only chair in the room was the desk chair. There was a little dressing table in the bathroom, my wife appreciated that. The fitness center was well equipped and clean. I will look elsewhere for our March trip to Chicago.

"Can't wait to go back to Chicago. The sights the people the food! MileNorth is a great hotel. It is just the right size and only a couple of blocks from Magnificent Mile on Michigan Ave. Huge suite with a king size bed and sofa sleeper,living area and desk/office area. Just blocks from Garretts Popcorn and the architectural boat tour. Good walking distance to the water tower and Eataly which is a must see. The hotel has the highest open air rooftop bar with Hancock tower as a fantastic backdrop. If you are looking to do a lot of dining in at your hotel this is not the right choice for you. If you are looking for a clean reasonably priced hotel in an excellent location this is it.

"Found great rate of about $110 for a hotel just steps from North Michigan Ave. BUT, overnight valet parking was $60 and we chose it because it was ""pet friendly"", although a non refundable fee of $75 for one night stay doesn't strike me as all that ""friendly. "" All in, with taxes,etc, our one night was closer to $300 than $100. I should've done my homework better, but hoping to save others the trouble. That said, the lobby was very cool and the room was nicely decorated and comfortable. And you cant beat the location. Mixed bag for us."
"Loved this hotel - very different from anything I've stayed in !Prime location just off magnificent mile and close to many restaurants n shopsReception staff incredibly friendly and took into consideration the fact that am claustrophobic and gave us a room with an open viewRoom is v spacious and well furnished although it has a retro look which I don't mind. The bed is really comfy and good water pressure in the shower. Basic amenities, free wifi n suchThe whole hotel has a retro look and I liked this about it - v different cozy warm feeling to the lobby (some might say it needs updating but it's well kept and clean throughout) and nice little coffee shop that keeps it a busy place"
"This is a new hotel in a great location On Superior and Michigan Ave. The rooftop lounge is very nice, but a bit small if the outdoor patio isn't open due to weather. You can also eat Chicago style pizza next door at Gino's. Valet parking is a bit pricey, $58 per day. Downtown we usually pay $50 per day at other hotels. The rooms are nice and big, and decorated very nicely but they do not have a full length mirror! The hotel staff was great!

"This hotel is almost perfect! The staff were incredibly friendly; on arrival, they even offered to source Blackhawks tickets for us. All hotel staff were really nice, and we were never left waiting for serive.The hotel location was perfect, right on the Magnificent Mile, two blocks from the Hancock Center and about 10 minutes walk from the river; an ideal location for everything we planned on doing.The room was really nice, it had a fridge, a really comfy bed, good tv channels and it was well lit. We had a view of two office blocks, but in between those two was the John Hancock Center, so it turned out to be a lovely view.The bathroom was clean and the shower pressure was good, but not great.Our one downside, was the noise outside of the room. The room door is really heavy, but it does nothing to stop the noise. At one stage we could hear hoovering, and even someone elses toilet flushing! It wasn't hugely bothersome, and didn't break our sleep, but it wasn't what you would expect.There is a coffee shop in the lobby which is a terrific idea, although we asked for a glass of milk at about 11.30 one evening, and were told they had closed.The bar on the top floor is very up-market, and a little expensive, but does give terrific views of Chicago.All in all, we would definitely stay here again, and we would recommend it very highly, to anyone looking to go to Chicago.Oh, and if you ask at the front desk, they will give you a card for Gino's East (the pizzeria next door), which will get you in ahead of the queue - the queue's were always massive, so take advantage of this!In a bit!Stephen

"In the city over the Thanksgiving holiday and this was our second stay. Nicely sized rooms, clean bathroom and a very comfortable bed. We didn't need it but I believe the couch in the living area was a sleeper and there was plenty of room to utilize that. As others have mentioned, you can't ask for a much better option if you want to be ""downtown"" - near shopping, restaurants, and Lake Michigan. I hesitate to give it the full 5 rating as I didn't find the staff to be overly friendly at the front desk upon arrival or at the Starbucks downstairs but that can obviously be hit or miss depending on the day. My wife also wanted me to mention that she found the the toilet paper to be scratchy. I suppose you can't please everyone.Next time we are in Chicago we will certainly be staying there - even if my wife brings her own supplies."
"Our stay was quiet, pleasant, and enjoyable. I was hesitant to stay in a hotel I didn't know anything about. However, the second we got there the friendliness of the staff and the modern, clean building let us know we had made the right decision.The staff could not have been more helpful. We wanted to know good places to eat: they knew them. We needed a cab: they got us one. At the time of our trip, we we're college students who were taking this trip with a very tight budget. We were excited to even be able to afford a king room. I'm sure this can't happen all the time, but upon our arrival they informed us that they were going to bump us up to a king suite. It was awesome! The room was so clean, modern, and spacious. We felt like we had reached the big time :)The bar on the top floor was really nice and enjoyable. Drinks were a little more than I would have liked to pay for, but hey- part of vacation I guess. On our last day we had the breakfast before we left. I can't remember how much it was, but I remember thinking it was worth the price, for sure.I still receive emails from the MileNorth, even though I usually hate email marketing. I'm excited to plan our next trip to Chicago, where we will definitely stay at the MileNorth again.

"I stayed in a King Suite for 3 nights because my apartment was being painted, and I didn't want to spend a fortune for a hotel. I was quite happy with my stay. It was such a joy to stay in a very spacious room. The desk area was separate from the living area which was separate from the area where the bed was. I get claustrophobic in hotel rooms quite often and this room was very comfortable and spacious. The staff was very friendly, including housekeeping and doorman. The location can't be beat! One block East of Michigan Avenue and all the great shopping and restaurants and bus routes just steps away! For the price and location, the Mile North Hotel offers a great value. There are nicer hotels for a romantic getaway or for a vacation, but if you are there on business, shopping trip, in Chicago visiting family, this place is great. Free W-Fi and had no problems getting on. The only complaints I had were: the bed could be more comfortable (I found it a little too hard). Also, on the ceiling outside my bathroom, the paint was peeling. It's not a large ceiling area so to re-paint wouldn't be an arduous task. It would be a lot more appealing to fix it. I would stay here again if needed.

"I stayed here a number of times when it was the Affinia, and have now stayed about 3 times after the transition to MileNorth. I'm not sure I'll go back. The room was fine, the front desk staff were fine, and the place in general is lively and inviting. I do miss the restaurant that was there when it was the Affinia. That place was beautiful, and I was always happy with the food. It think the appeal of the property has diminished by its absence. But there were a couple of things that really bugged me this time in the form of policy. My wife and I arrived at the desk around noon, and wanted to check in. I know we were early. We were told that for $29 we could check in early. No way that's gonna happen. I don't understand why a room isn't just given to a customer if it's available. In my opinion, letting me have the room because it's ready, and I'm there, is zero. So charge me zero. It seems to me that for no cost to MileNorth, they could have made me happy, and this review would be a lot different. Keep in mind the front desk staff never said the room wasn't available. And on to the next thing.... An up-front charge of $65 was made to my card for incidentals. That haven't been consumed. That one is tough to fathom, but I don't purchase incidental items, so I don't get it. My wife did the check in, and was blindsided by the charge explanation from the front desk. I wasn't there, and definitely would have fought back. At check-out, the charge was gone, but by that time, the PR damage had been done. Because of these 2 policies, I personally felt punished, either because others have taken advantage of the hotel in some way, or MileNorth has figured out a way to make a few more dollars. I don't think hotels should be rewarded for these kinds of policies. I'm upset by this experience, and don't like saying bad things about businesses. I love the hotel, and it's location, but I thought the PR loss associated with these policies is significant. There are too many lodging options in Chicago.

"I was surprised at how quiet this hotel was. The windows are covered in an extra pane of glass which serves to reduce the noise to near zero. As well, during the 4 nights I stayed here, I only heard other guests in the hallway a couple of times, and never any noise from adjoining rooms. Sure, there was the occasional muted siren from ambulances arriving at the neighbouring hospital, but these were not disturbing in any way.The room was a good size and the bed positively huge. Furnishings were of a high standard and there was the nice touch of the reclining armchair next to the window with the street view. Ask for a room facing the front of the hotel for the better views - the ones in the back overlook the backs of other buildings.Our room was on the 5th floor, which meant it was serviced by 2 elevators which were dedicated to the 1st - 7th floors. This was fortuitous for us, since the remaining 8th - 29th floors were serviced by 2 other elevators, one of which was out of commission for our entire stay. As a result there were very long lines and excessive waits for those residing in the upper floors. I would have rated this hotel as ""very good"" instead of ""excellent"" if I had been impacted directly by this issue.We did travel up to the 29th floor to have a light meal in the roof lounge. Since it was winter, only the very small indoor section was open, but we were lucky enough to get a table and enjoyed the views over the city. Food was good and there was a good selection of drinks.Location is perfect, an easy walk to shopping, restaurants and even down to Grant Park and the Art Institute. We really recommend visiting the Dreihaus Museum. We've been to Chicago 3 times and only just discovered it this time. Beautiful place and exception Tiffany exhibit on while we were there.Staff were friendly and efficient. The room was in good shape, with some minor wear and tear in the bathroom (peeling wallpaper, some minor water damage). Overall a very nice place for a reasonable price."
"Mile North was so warm and cozy I would return. Check in was quick and easy. I stayed by myself so the room was the perfect size for me. There was enough room for me to work on my lap top, listen to my ipod and then watch television. The bathroom was very cute too. I love Chicago and this area is close to everything. In particular, it is a short walk to the train, my favorite pizza place and my favorite wine bar. Not to mention the roof top bar. The drinks were pricey, but it was a nice place to hang out with friends."

"I had stayed at MileNorth two years ago, and gave it an excellent review. I hadn't been back since then, and I won't be returning again after my experience this weekend. First, when I arrived at 3:45pm, they were unable to check me in. They said that rooms of the type that I had booked weren't available. When I came back a few hours later, they said that there were still no rooms of the type that I had booked, and put me in a less expensive room (and charged me the lower rate). The room itself was OK, though showing some minor signs of wear. Many stations on the TV were static-y. Also there is no sound insulation from the hallway. The elevators to the higher floors always require a ridiculously long wait, and are too small to fit all the people trying to go up and down. Their Destination Delivers VIP Club is confusing, and they wouldn't give me the discount that I would have gotten if I had been able to figure out how to enter it when I made my reservation. Front desk and bellman staff were generally fine, but insufficiently staffed. There are many far superior four star options nearby (Talbott, James, Thompson). I won't be back."
"I stayed here in October with two girlfriends -- can't say enough about the location, the staff, the room, the food and the view! We make a trip 2 or 3 times a year and this will definitely be our new go-to hotel. They have a Starbucks in the lobby, and the young woman working there was so sweet and remembered our exact drink orders the next day! How do they do that?? We didn't use the valet service, but the bellmen remembered us and welcomed us back each time we came and went through the door. We are definitely planning on returning to MileNorth for our next trip!!


Room Tip: We paid for a suite upgrade and loved the space!

"Overall we were happy with our stay. Both our room and bathroom were large and comfortable. Just some little details that would have made our stay even better. We had the MileNorth King on the third floor. It faces the service entrances so in the wee hours you can hear the delivery/garbage trucks backing up. The beeping is not very loud but if you're a very light sleeper, this could be a problem. In the morning, the barista bar serves starbucks coffee, sandwiches and not much else. If you want more breakfast choices, there are good options only a short walk away."
"This hotel is in a great location for enjoying the Mag mile and the Chicago entertainment district. It is just a couple of blocks off Michigan Ave which makes it much quieter at night than hotels on Michigan Ave. In the summer, it is a short walk to the lakefront. We found all of the staff to be really helpful with directions and suggestions. The rooftop bar is great, and is really a hidden gem in the city. The rooms were very comfortable. We will definitely be returning to this hotel."
"Gotta love a room with a recliner chair! Slept great thanks to good bed & pillows, exceptionally quiet property, and super effective blackout curtains. Stylish design throughout. Free wifi, big desk with plenty of outlets, super friendly staff, excellent upstairs bar with attractive rooftop outside space. I had an outstanding hamburger at the bar. Populous hotel location felt safe and...

"Stayed here in September and would definitely come back again.Fantastic location.Roof top pool which we did use at 9.30 at night but it was due to close at 10 so didn't have that long.Spectacular views from here as well.Reception staff where efficient and no problems checking in or out.Cafe/bar in reception which had a trendy vibe to it.Room was clean and tidy and the beds where very comfy.Would I stay here again,Yes I would without even giving it a thought."
"We have actually stayed at this hotel several times, mostly because the location is near the things we like to do. This visit, we actually booked their most expensive room (City View, King Suite) for 3 nights. We actually arrived around 1PM, but knowing official check in wasn't until 3PM, we thought we would check to see if our room happened to be available, if not, no big deal, we were planning on dropping off our luggage and going to get lunch. The check in person proceeded to tell us that our room was indeed ready, but there would be a $29 fee to check in early. Really, 2 hours early? We travel a lot, and I have never heard of an ""early check in fee"" (late check out fee, yes). We declined and just dropped off our luggage. To top it off, we road up in the elevator the next morning, around 11AM with someone who had just checked in, and we asked if they had been charged an ""early check in fee"", and they said no. So, let me get this right, we are repeat customers, booking your most expensive room, so you figure you can nickel and dime us? No thanks, will not be staying here again."
"Utilized Hotel Tonight to book this hotel in October 2014 and I was pleased with my choice! Location was great-right off the hustle and bustle of the Mag Mile and right next to Gino's pizza. View from my room was directly looking at the Hancock Tower. Loved the sunken room. Nice size and very clean. Took the train from O'Hare and a 10 minute walk to hotel from Blue Line. The rooftop bar and lounge, 52 Eighty, had great views and ambiance, the bartender whipped me up a specialty cocktail which was delich!Been to the Chi many times, and this hotel was absolutely the best. I would return again and would go to the rooftop just for drinks. Couldn't afford the regular rate though, so I only stayed one night."
"This hotel has the BEST the location. The rooms are amazing!! A sitting area, desk area,and bedroom are all separate. We had a room on floor 23. It was Clean and great views. The walls were a little thin at night and the pillows were very ""hard!"" I usually bring my own but forgot. We loved having a fridge in the room too. The staff was exceptional From check in to check out!! The bar in the lobby was nice and welcoming. We loved Emily! She took excellent care of us and had some fun conversation. The Starbucks was much enjoyed each morning while sitting on the patio. Can not wait to go back again!!


Room Tip: ask for the HIGH tower! Rooms are bigger.

"I've book a room for a conference in Chicago, strangely I had to book three reservation for three different night, after my stay I found that I was charge not the price that I booked but the double. I try several time to contact the manager and the finance, after couple of day they let me know that the change was made and rembourse me, in fact they did nothing. And I'm not able to reach anybody"
"This hotel is very nice. Clean, modern rooms. There's a rooftop bar, but we didn't visit it so I can't comment on it. I loved having the coffee shop in the lobby, which serves Starbucks! The location right off Michigan Ave was perfect! My only complaints...valet parking for 2 nights was over $100! The only mirror in our room was the small one above the sink in the bathroom. It was very difficult for my husband and I to get ready at the same time. And lastly, try getting a room on a lower floor. We were on the 28th floor and we waited a long time for the elevators."
"Really enjoyed staying at the Mile North Hotel. Great location, which we were close to walk to all our favorite restaurants and shopping on Michigan Ave. The room was very nice and roomy. The bed was very comfortable and the linens and towels were quality. The coffee shop in the lobby was so convenient for a morning cappuccino. The staff at the front desk were absolutely wonderful, always a smile, hello and welcome. We will definitely return here for our next visit to the Windy City. I forgot to mention the awesome rooftop bar. Great outdoor couches and settings with awesome views. Brecken the bartender was delightful, he was so friendly and made our evening very special."
I love this place. If I visit Chicago I will choose this hotel. It's. A great location downtown and is walking distance to a lot of things and a short distance to the red line. The staff was some of the best I have experienced they were more than courteous and very accommodating. Their recommendations were really good and they were able to provide good directions to other places. They do have free wifi and it was pretty good. The beds were a bit hard but not unusable like others had mentioned. We didn't rent a car so we did not pay the $$ for the parking. However on the downside they do charge to have a microwave a few of 20$ per day yikes. My infant son likes warm formula and so he had room temperature. But overall it was perfect. I am very appreciative of the quality of serv that was provided.
"We stayed at this hotel in August 2014 whilst traveling the USA, the hotel has a nice fresh entrance lobby and a small coffee/alcoholic bar set within it. Our room was a nice size and felt clean, the bed was comfy also. The location was great for what we wanted, right on the Magnificent Mile (well just a 10 second walk anyway!). There are restaurants nearby however we did have a 10-15 minute walk one night to find a restaurant we fancied, that is just us though! The only negative comments we had were that when we checked in the check in staff put a numbered tag on our luggage and left our suitcases on a roller in the middle of the lobby, we asked if we could take them to our room ourselves but were told that we were not allowed (Insurance purposes maybe?), we had many valuables in there and felt reluctant to leave our goods, we hung by the lift for around 5-10 minutes waiting for the bell boy but he never appeared, we took it upon ourselves to remove our cases from the roller and take them all up ourselves, as we were travelling we had 4 suitcases and 2 shoulder bags, this was an inconvenience as when you pay for service you do expect slightly more, it was just too greater risk leaving our bags unattended by an open front door for anyone to steal. The other comment is that our bedroom floor by the A/C unit was soaking wet, presumably from the unit itself, we did not bother to complain as we were only there for a few nights but surely the bedroom maids would have noticed when cleaning? Anyway, not a bad hotel but stayed in a lot better for the money. Really nice rooftop bar in the evenings for cocktails!


Room Tip: I would try and get a room with a view facing the front of the hotel.

"You pay for the location, which is great. It's half a block off of Michigan Ave. Feature wise, nothing to write home about. Fuzzy TV signal, and constantly running toilet, which started to overflow our last morning there. Bathrooms could use some updating. Chipped tiles and the tub wasn't the cleanest. No complaints about elevators, and we were on one of the higher floors. Our view was into an office building so we could see people working. You WILL get charged a $9 per day fee at check out, no way of avoiding that. Of course, they don't mention it until you are checking out. I'm not sure I would stay there again based on what we had to pay for the hotel."
"The staff was GREAT, thanks Dora (at front desk) hooked me up with a suite. It was beautiful. Loved the room, Urban buddy is a GREAT app and everyone should download and get this app when visiting any city. It provides you with real locals who know their city, and can tell you the best hole-in-the-wall spots to check out, just like a text!

"This hotel is behind Northwestern Hopsital and used to be accomodation for staff. It has been done up well but you can still detect an institutional feel in the corridors and from the old heating/colling and plumbing system.Check in was quick and service was okay--a bit perfunctory. I had many packages delivered and the bellman promised to deliver them after helping me with my bags. However, after an hour I had to go and find him. He said he had been busy. I stood in the reception area to make sure I got my packages. One went missing but the duty receptionist found it after a few hours. The next day I had laundry which was again not delivered to my room on arrival. I had to go to reception to get it from the bellman. I had a very early morning flight and so wanted to settle my bill the night before. Unfortunately, the room night charge is only posted after midnight. I had paid in advance for a guaranteed rate and so the system was showing I had a credit but the staff kept reading this as money I owed. It took nearly 20 minutes to sort this out. That being said, the night receptionists are very friendly and efficient. One gave me a wake up call and had the bellman come to my room to pick up my luggage (unasked) 5 minutes before the time I had ordered a cab for. Truly first rate service.Room size is spacious and decor modern with large flat screen TV. You get free high speed Internet. There is a 24 hour small gym which has all you need, including free weights, weight machines, treadmills and jogging machines.There is a tiny Starbucks outlet in the lobby to have breakfast at--you are better off going across the street to St. Claire's and eating with all the hospital workers. Bottomline: I got value for money and would stay here again, but service could be improved by the concierge team in particular and all reception staff should know how to check out a guest who has paid in advance. The hotel is also justifiably popular so it can get very crowded in the lobby and waiting for an elevator. As other guests have noted, the room doors also slam shut and can wake you up."
"Lovely modern comfortable hotel in an excellent location. 2mins walk for the mag mile with abundance of shops. Not many places to eat/drink directly around but walk a bit and youll find them.Large ""Suite Like"" room with all the extras, only downfall was the AC - noisy and cold and windows couldnt be opened. Staff are lovely and the terrace bar worth a visit. As was the lobby bar for food and drinks.Would run back!"
"My husband and I stayed at this hotel last weekend and had a fabulous time. Hotel check-in and checkout was efficient, and staff at the desk were friendly and provided us with great dinner and site seeing recommendations. It is walking distance for great shopping and dining options. The room was spacious and clean and the roof top patio provides a fantastic view of the city. The staff at the roof top patio were friendly and the drink and dining menu was impressive. Being pregnant the bar tender was kind enough to create a fun non-alcoholic beverage. I would stay here again. Chicago is a great city!"
"We stopped in Chicago on the way home from Ohio and booked this hotel the day before. It's downtown in Chicago and is fairly new so thought $200 was very reasonable pricing. Checking In was fine and the bellman was very friendly and helpful. We had a suite with a queen bed but my sister and I didn't want to share so I used the pull out sofa. It was like a foam block.we called room service for an extra blanket for me because all that's offered is a sheet and another thin blanket, they said it'd be 20 minutes but it never showed up. Our room was in a corner and the staff only cleaning room was right beside us. When the cleaning ladies showed up in the morning they were VERY loud. They constantly slammed the door and were laughing and talking loudly outside our door which woke us up. You'd just get back to sleep and it'd start all over again. The rooms definitely need more insulting to block out hallway noise. I had also stood at the Starbucks counter for at least five minutes without being acknowledged. There was two guys working and they'd look at me and then continue doing something other then helping me so I finally left. The hotel is nice and renovated and on a fairly quiet side street but overall I'd hoped for something better."
"A good value, perhaps a bit dated but good value hotel in an excellent central location, easily accessible to bars, Mag Mile shops, restaurants, numerous central attractions, the beach and lots more. Staff are excellent, very helpful and knowledgeable. There's a nice roof top trendy bar and second ground floor bar where you can also buy coffees and snacks etc. A bit noisy though, chatter etc can travel into your room from landings but did not detract from our overall stay and opinion. I would recommend this place for those economy conscious visitors who need comfort, a central position and no fuss."
"We booked this hotel through Priceline and didn't realize that the hotel would not guarantee a room with two beds. When we arrived we were offered a room with a queen bed and not even enough room for a roll away. Since I must have my own space, we upgraded to a king suite. The staff was very helpful with this and the room was so spacious! Some reviewers liked eating at Gino's next door, but neither of us were impressed and the lines were long. We enjoyed walking down St. Clair and eating at Elephant and Castle. And breakfast at the Corner Bakery on the same street was just right."
"Was slightly disapointed by this hotel, but perhaps my expectations were too high. I used to live in Chicago and visit often. Was not aware of this hotel, but saw a promotion on Jetsetter that advertised a ""large suite spread out over two floors with a seperate living room, sofabed..."" I decided to splurge, dreams of a duplex room dancing in my head which was perfect as we were in Chicago visiting friends and wanted a seperate place to hang out that wasn't right in our bedroom.We arrived for our late check-in and the front desk person was friendly, but slow in getting us sorted out. We were also surprised to hear there would be an additional daily tax that was not stated in the Jetsetter price.The first room we were shown was far from ""spread out over two floors."" It was a small entrance way with a desk and chair that leads down a few steps to a living room and bedroom area that are not seperated. There was a very small bathroom with one sink and a toilet with a crack in it. The living area also only had two chairs (no couch) and no coffee table so entertaining was out of the question.We went back downstairs and were switched to another room, the exact same layout and just one floor higher (this one did have a sofabed and table). The view from the 10th floor was south and overlooked a parking structure and some basic office buildings. Nothing special.The mini bar was oddly loud and not stocked (which for me is fine since I would rather stock it myself, but I found that strange).The room was right next door to the elevator, but it was fine and quiet. The lock on the door of our room was jammed and we had a few close calls with not being able to get out of the room.At check out, I argued the addition of the daily tax as my reservation stated that all taxes and fees were included. They took some time conferring with a manager, but ultimately waived the charge.All told, it was fine, just not special. I do think they may need to dial back their room descriptions to something that more closely resembles the truth.


Room Tip: 10th floor did not have much of a view. Ask for a higher floor.

"We have stayed at this hotel 4 times in the last year while visiting our daughter who lives two blocks away. The location is incredible. The rooms are large, very clean, and huge bathrooms. The fitness center is very well maintained. And, the staff is great! They remembered us on all of our visits. I booked the hotel on Orbitz and got a great rate every time, too. Will definitely stay here again!

We had a good stay and enjoyed the location but got an unexpected services bill at the end of our stay. on checking-in a deposit was taken for $60 which we were told was for incidentals and were assured would be refunded at the end of our stay. On check-out $40 was deducted from the deposit for wifi which is advertised as free on the website. This low score is due to this sting at the end of our stay. Why say it will be refunded when there is every intention of this deduction.Hamza
"We stayed overnight and got a King Suite. It was very comfortable. Had a large queen size sleep sofa for the kids and an extra tv for their area. Bathroom was the biggest I've seeing at a hotel in Chicago. Hotel is beautiful, super clean! Location was great! 100 meters to Michigan Ave by Neiman Marcus and Children's Steps to Apple, Saks, Zarah, VS and close by to American Girl. We travel to Chicago few times a year and from now on this is our hotel. There is a parking next door in case you don't want to use their valet."
"This hotel is very close to several great restaurants and shopping centers. There was always a staff member available to find you a cab regardless of what time it was. The receptionists were all very nice and were very helpful in providing assistance with transportation to and from the airport. I would definitely recommend this hotel to others and would definitely return. Our room had a great view and it was very clean. I didnt give the hotel a excellent rating because we requested a blanket and it never came, we had to call the front desk again to request the blanket again. Other than that the service was great. Cute decorations in the lobby and unique decorations in the rooms, great place to stay while in Chicago."
The MileNorth Hotel was a lovely place to stop situated right in the centre of Chicago not far from the Magnificent Mile. The rooms were well appointed with plenty of space and modern decor. The bed was comfy and pillows good quality. The hotel came pretty close to scoring a five but was let down by the absence of a safe in the room (albeit there was a space where it should have been and was in their advertising) and by the noisy air conditioning and fridge. There are plenty of restaurants nearby and several lower budget eating options if required. Overall a good stay.
"Having a great experience in Chicago, largely due to this hotel's location, you can imagine how deflated I felt to discover a $126 charge on my visa weeks after our return. Having left our daughter's cherished stuffed animal behind, we proceeded to call the hotel and ask to have it shipped back to us in Canada, (just across the border from Detroit) Having shipped many items in the past, I was prepared/expecting to pay at least $20-$30 but it would cost that much to replace the thing anyways! The ""house keeping"" department, who the hotel claims is not affiliated with them-GO FIGURE-proceeded to hold the tattered and loved stuffy in their hands, put a value of $1 on the outside of the envelope (not even a box to boot) and charged my visa over $90 plus taxes (and with the exchange, etc....)I would hope that anyone with the slightest value on customer service would contact the customer to verify that this amount was ok, but evidently not!!!!! I have no patience for the ""pass the buck"" attitude I encountered, and a little courtesy, compassion and empathy would go a long way in this establishment."
"This was our third visit - tower rooms are wonder, very quiet. Great location, too. Enjoyed the breakfast buffet (wonderful staff) but rooftop bar staff left us cold. We were close to everything we needed and it was easy to get transportation as well when we needed. If we return to Chicago, I will definitely check the Mile North availabilities first.

"Located near the Loop, MileNorth Hotel is convenient especially for people who want to explore downtown Chicago. Another plus about this hotel's location is that it's not only a few blocks away from the nearest CTA subway station and Hancock Tower, the hotel is also located right next to Gino's East (Good news for people who are looking for deep dish). MileNorth also has a cool rooftop bar for those who enjoy nightlife!The room was also unusually spacious. The bed was comfortable and the bathroom facility was great. The room was a great place both to rest and to work, and if you live on the upper levels, you would have a terrific view of downtown Chicago.However, living on the upper level was also the reason why I cannot give this hotel five stars. Getting to my 25th floor room was a hassle especially during nighttime. MileNorth has four elevators, but only two would reach floors above 7th floor. The two high-reaching elevators became extremely packed and stuffy (Elevator AC was probably broken) as the day progressed, and the situation worsened especially during weekend nights when people were going to the rooftop bar. Because there were only two elevators going to 8th to 29th floors, the elevators would have to stop multiple times, so just getting to my room from the lobby was a long, hot trip of itself own. I don't know how MileNorth can resolve this issue, but you should request a room on 7th floor or below. You won't get the view, but trust me, it's a small sacrifice you have to make to have an easy trip to your room.Aside from this upper floor problem, I believe that MileNorth should be one of your top picks if you are visiting downtown Chicago. The spacious room, the friendly staff, and the convenient location make this hotel an excellent choice for you to explore the Windy City.

"The only reason I didn't give this hotel 5 circles is because they don't inform you that they are going to charge you a $6.95 service fee for each reservation for use of wifi, business center, fitness center, etc which we didn't use at all during our one night stay. However, even with this charge, the hotel was an excellent value - we received a great last minute rate through the hotel website which was cheaper than the best rate I had found elsewhere. The location was convenient to all we wanted to do in Chicago. We had our twin one year olds with us and they provided us with two cribs. The room had a long entry way which gave us a place to put the cribs and be able to have a little separation from them which was important since they go to bed before us. Our room had a great view of the city skyline. Both the room and bathroom were large. I would definitely return to this hotel if I return to Chicago."
"Stayed at the MileNorth with family. The hotel is well located and one block away to catch a bus to the museum districts. Our room was on the 26th floor with a nice view down St. Clair. The staff was very friendly and accommodating and we were even able to check into our room early which helped us get our bearings before hitting the town.The room was not overly large but it was not cramped either. As other reviewers mentioned there was a slight step down from the entry/bathroom/fridge/desk area to where the beds were. The beds were comfortable and the room was very quiet. There are only a handful of rooms on each floor so there is not a lot of traffic or door slamming going on.We did not take advantage of the restaurant or visit the bar on this trip. However, we did do the American Girl package for our daughter which was all ready to go when we arrived. For those interested, the American Girl store is just about 3 blocks away and a very easy walk from the hotel."
"Usually when I stay in Chicago I am staying further south toward Grant Park, but since we were in town for a wedding on the Magnificent Mile we booked here. First of all, this was a great value. We paid in advance on a cutthroat rate I found on kayak.com, so for us this was a steal. We paid much less than the other rates in this area that our family had. The room was massive! One of the biggest city hotel rooms I had ever had. The hotel had a trendy vibe but wasn't stuffy. The cafe in the lobby was great for my morning coffee fix (they serve Starbucks) and the staff were really helpful. My room was ready when I arrived a few hours early and I was very tired from travel and happy to be able to go right up and relax. Our bathroom was very large with a lovely shower and nice soft towels. The wallpaper was metallic and peeling in some spots, but I didn't mind it. I checked out the gym with good intentions (I never went) and it was pretty small but nicely stocked. We never made it up to the rooftop, we were so busy in Chicago. The wifi in our room was quite spotty so I was glad I didn't end up bringing up computer, but again we didn't care because we were not in our room that much.The location was really great. Totally walkable from the red line of the subway and also near a Divvy station for bike access (my sister and I took bikes one day). Right next to the historic Original Gino's East for pizza and there were tons of food options and shopping nearby - it's the Magnificent Mile!I would definitely consider staying here again and would recommend it highly."
"MileNorth is in a great location - close to shopping, the Hancock tower and a short walk to Oak Street beach. The rooms are comfortable and larger than most I've been to in Chicago. I also really appreciated their green initiatives - they offered a $5 per day credit if you opted not to have your room cleaned/linens replaced and they have in shower dispensers for their shampoo, conditioner, and body wash vs. the travel size bottles."
"This is a very useful and well-located hotel. The area is very safe at all hours. We were in Chicago for a Northwestern Law School graduation and this hotel's location was perfect. It is just off the Magnificent Mile, super close to Northwestern Law School (and the Northwestern Medical Center's many buildings) and a very short walk to Michigan Avenue for ready access to public transit as well. The hotel's decor is a funny combo of uber modern (virtual fireplaces) with charming touches of vintage (old school typewriters and suitcases), resulting in a quirky, but comfortable setting. The lobby is not large, but has adequate seating areas and gathering spaces. A small coffee bar and restaurant also share the first floor.Our room had a small set of stairs (2 steps) between the bed and the room's entrance, bathroom and desk areas. Not a problem for us, but worth noting if mobility, particularly in a dark room at night, are of concern. The linens, bedding and room fittings were lovely; our room was remarkably silent. The front-desk staff are friendly, professional and efficient, but the doormen are notably aloof and disinterested with the result that they are completely unhelpful with cabs. Fortunately, the taxis are plentiful throughout the area, well-regulated and reliable. (In other words, you don't have to worry about safety when getting into a random cab.)The hotel has a rooftop bar called '5280' which has a lovely view. Nothing remarkable about the drinks, but we enjoyed their sliders as a pick-me-up in between the weekend's events.There is a Gino's East Pizza next door."
Very pleased with our experience at MileNorth. Centrally located less than a block off of Michigan Ave its location was great as we travelled primarily north and south along Michigan Ave and east to the Navy Pier. We stayed 5 nights in a Cityview Room (Room 2702) which offered a great view along St. Clair St with the Prudential Building in the distance. The room was big enough for 3. Hotel staff were friendly and helpful. If eating at Gino's East ask them for a pass to go to the front of the line. They were also helpful with shopping and dining selections and would have helped with tour suggestions if we had not had all our time already booked. Room was clean and well kept by the cleaning staff. The lobby had a good vibe as it offered a Starbucks and Ferris and Jacks with lots of seating (chairs and couches). Nice atmosphere to relax and hang out. Only negative was that the room door let in a lot of light and noise. Fortunately there was not a lot of noise from the adjoining rooms so it was not much of an inconvenience. Would definitely stay again.
"A great top notch hotel at a perfect spot. We walked just about everywhere from here. Negatives: The walls are pretty thin and our neighbors were partying bachelors. Rooftop bar was pricey. Doors in hallways close loudly. Woke me up every night. Pros: food in lounge was great. Concierge and taxi attendants were super helpful. Tip I learned from others in trip advisor if you got to Gino's east next door, get a VIP pass at front desk and skip the hour line. Worth It. Great view from hotel room. LOCATION LOCATION LOCATION. I also hard the gym two days which was perfect with all the eating and drinking we did. Everyone in hotel treated us with top notch customer service."
"A one night get-away felt like a weekend with all the things Chicago has to offer. MileNorth is chic and funky and close to everything. Easily accessible when you drive up on Superior, friendly and helpful doormen who unloaded the car and bikes. They even stored the bikes for a bike ride on the Lakefront the next day. There's a breakfast cafe one block from the hotel and the Lakefront is only a few blocks away. Spent the day in Old Town so the hotel stored the bags until it was time to and loaded bags and bikes and sent us on our way."
"What a wonderful experience we had in Chicago! The hotel is in a fantastic location (right off Michigan Ave and steps away from everything!). The lobby is very chic and well decorated, as well as comfortable if you want to sit and relax. We made use of the snack bar within the lobby- great for grabbing a coffee and bagel for the road. The staff at front desk were very helpful and friendly, and were kind enough to stow away our baggage until our room was ready so we could leave right away to explore the city. The room was impeccable- clean, comfortable and spacious- and ACTUALLY looked like it did in the pictures (unlike many hotels I have stayed at). I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone going to Chicago, and I also hope to stay there on personal trips in the future. AMAZING HOTEL!!!"
"We were in Chicago for a reunion at the U of C. Spent one night at MileNorth and then moved to another hotel where we had two rooms for the weekend (were meeting friends). We came early in order to do some sightseeing and go to the Cubs game. This hotel is wonderfully located close to everything, accessible to public transportation and we were able to walk to our dinner the night of arrival. We went to the newly renovated bar at the top of the hotel and had a glass of wine. Beautiful at night. We also had a quick breakfast at the Starbucks in the lobby in the morning. The room was exceptionally clean and well maintained. The view we had was to the north and faced another building. No view but we did not care. Front desk staff was very accommodating and friendly. We both thought that the hotel was an excellent choice and would not hesitate to return again."
"This hotel is just off Michigan Avenue in the perfect location to be able to see all the sights and lots of shops. Great bar on the top floor too for a relaxing end to the day. Short walk to Water Tower Place, John Hancock and many, many restaurants. You will also find the price is right for the area. And because it is off

"My wife and I recently spent two nights at MileNorth. It is conveniently located a block off Michigan Ave and right next door to a great Chicago Pizza restaurant (Gino's East). In one day we were able to walk to the Navy Pier, venture around, then head back and shop Michigan Ave. If your curious it is also a 40 min walk to the Willis Tower. The staff at MileNorth were very friendly and inviting. Our room looked exactly as the website pictures showed it would look. We had a great view of the city from our room but if you're looking for a better view hit up the 29th floor bar. The only downfall is that there is no parking. You have to park in the parking garage which is across the street and owned by the hospital. Make sure you budget $52.00 per day for parking. Next time my wife and I are looking to get away in Chicago, MileNorth will be our first choice."
"My husband and I stayed one night at the Mile North. We choose this hotel because it is so conveniently near the location of his doctor appointment at Northwestern Hospital. It is also located right next door to the Children's Hospital. We had a one night stay. We parked our car in the public ramp right across from the hotel. After getting our ticket validated at his appointment the next day- we only paid $24 for parking. Also- Mile North has a Northwestern Hospital rate. I did not see it on the web site- but when I called to make my reservation- I mentioned we were coming for an appointment- and the reservation agent explained that there was a special rate for Northwestern. With the special rate, and the validated parking, our stay was actually pretty reasonable for a downtown hotel. Our room was nice sized- and a nice king-size bed. Our ""view"" was not good (back of another building and nothing pleasant to see)- but we were there for the appointment and not there for tourist-y reasons. We did not have house keeping so I can't comment on that. The check out is a 12:00 which is also nice. We need to continue with appointments at Northwestern- so unless we are incredibly disappointed on a future visit- Mile North will be our hotel choice.


Room Tip: Ask about the Northwestern Rate if you are coming for an appointment. And have your parking ticket v...

"Stayed here overnight on a last minute rate using Hotel Tonight App. Staff were incredibly friendly and helpful and gave us a free room upgrade. The location is excellent just off Michigan Ave. and the room furnishings are nice, but not lavish. Room was clean, comfortable and spacious, with a good skyline view. Did however, hear a number of ambulance sirens at early hours given the location across the street from Northwestern hospital. A nice roof bar and relaxed cafe/bar in the lobby provide options close to home, plus Gino's East is next door and the bartender let us enjoy our pizza with a glass of wine at the bar. Only real knock is the $60 overnight parking fees, which are standard for the area, but extortionate nonetheless. If not for the HotelTonight rates, may have thought hard about moving a few blocks off the Ave. for better rates and parking."
"We come to Chicago every year for the annual gathering of our industry. This is the third year in a row that we have stayed at the MileNorth. Hotels are rated on the friendliness of the staff, comfort of the room, and proximity to all that matters during a visit (this is my opinion). The MileNorth excels at all three. Always with a smile and helpful, the staff is super. As a frequent traveler I loose a great deal of sleep in new beds. This hotel has comfy accommodations in terms of spaciousness, cleanliness, and HVAC noise. Slept like a baby all three nights. The rooftop bar is a bonus as well. Being a block of Michigan Avenue near the Water Tower Place also makes it convenient to all attractions. You have tons of options for hotels in Chicago. You will not go wrong with this one.


Room Tip: No HVAC noise, comfy beds, spacious interior so you don't feel closed in. These rooms are not t...

"This is my second stay here within a 6 month period and I was very satisfied after the first 2 night stay so I re-booked and was excited to stay 3 nights this time. Well my excitement was quickly brought to a halt when my daughter opened the sofa bed up to discover that it was badly broken and hanging on the floor to the point of where she couldn't sleep on it. As if that wasn't enough, the mattress was so soiled with spots and stains that it had a smell. They ended up bringing us a roll away bed and eventually moved us to another smaller room the next afternoon. After requesting on 2 separate occasions to speak with a member of management my request was never granted and it never happened. I'm so disappointed with MileNorth since I put them in a different category than other chain hotels... I guess they are just the average hotel in a good area with average to poor service. Not a good look MileNorth...SMH


Room Tip: If you get a suite and your going to use the sofa bed, check it out before you unpack!

"We spent four days and three nights in Chicago with family; each family had their own room at the MileNorth hotel. The service was excellent, rooms clean, comfortable and spacious. I recommend this hotel and will stay there again.It is centrally located to many of the Chicago area attractions. So many restaurants you could hardly decide which one to choose. We look forward to when we can go back again."
"I very much enjoyed all aspects of the Mile North Hotel. It offers everything needed along with a perfect location for enjoying all that the city has to offer. I would highly recommend the character and charm this hotel has to offer, along with all the amenities one would need in comparison to one of the large chain hotels.


Room Tip: The one bed queen room is a nicer set up.

I decided to stay here because of the great reviews I read. I arrived a little earlier than check-in and it was no problem at all. I was taken to my room with in a few minutes and boy was it beautiful!! Great decor and perfect use of space. I wish the tub in the bathroom was deeper but totally not a deal breaker. My view was spectacular at night; the lights of the city are simply dreamy. The location was perfect for shopping and eating. The cafe in the lobby totally fed my addiction for Starbucks; loved it!! When I return to Chicago I will more than likely try my best to get back into MileNorth!!!!
"I had a rough flight into Chicago and when I walked into the hotel, they upgraded me to a suite. It was so unexpected and it erased the previous awful 24 hours I had. The staff was so accommodating and the whole vibe of the hotel is trendy, fun, and modern. It's in a really safe and fun area, there is plenty of shopping and even a Trader Joe's in case you need groceries. I went for a run along the water and the front desk gave me a map so I felt confident about where to go."
"I stayed at the MileNorth for 5 nights recently while helping a friend who was having major surgery at Northwestern Memorial Hospital. The hotel is one block from the hospital complex. It isw a half block off the Magnificient Mile, and near lots of attractions and restaurants, etc. The MileNorth is a boutique hotel with very helpful staff, a busy, but friendly and inviting lobby and spectacular rooms. My room had a king size bed, with fold out sofa in a separate living room area. Seating was comfortable, with a wonderful lounge chair included. Large windows overlooked the street below. In the lobby, you could get an informal breakfast, coffee, wine and snacks. Computers were there availabe for use, and helpful staff made using them a breeze. Daily newspaper was available for the taking along with area guides. The gym on the 7th floor was quite adequate. I did not get to try the lounge on the 29th floor but it sounded marvelous. Would definitely stay there again and again.


Room Tip: Room 1001 was large and comfy, with big windows overlooking the street below.

"I usually pat myself on the shoulder making right choice when I go with tripadvisor's review and this was a quite unusual case. This was a mediocre hotel and indeed I didn't like their practice. There was a surprise charge every corner. My arrival at O'hare was 10:30AM. So I called the hotel front desk before making reservation several months before to confirm that they would do their best to accommodate early check-in as long as available. Arrival Day. After I picked up my luggage, I called the hotel and asked if there is availability for early check-in, they said there is a room and they will charge me $35 for early check-in. Unpleasantly surprised, I arrived at the hotel. Unlike what I heard on the phone, this person at the front desk gave me key without charging. Strange practice this hotel has. One night we were dining in one of the great steak houses in Chicago and had so much left overs. So I called the hotel to see if there is a microwave we can use in the hotel. I was told they can send a microwave to our room but we have to pay $35 for it. I asked whether that was a deposit. The person said no. The hotel is quite not accommodating. We had to leave all the great steak sides and left over steaks behind us. The last day morning, I saw a huge bill under the door. I called the front desk and asked what it was. The hotel fridge had nothing. Not even water. I used my phone the whole time. What else can it possibly be? They said they charge for WIFI and they charged every night! Excuse me? The hotel website does not say they charge for wifi anywhere and even when they gave me wifi password at check-in they never mentioned they will charge. Haha. This made me laugh. These guys are ridiculous. The person who answered the call offered to delete this charge with a strange reason ; ""Oh, you made a reservation a while ago"". Really? So if I made a reservation recently, then, I have to pay for Wifi when you never told me this is not free? Things they did quite made no sense to me. Very strange practice. The hotel did not look a sketchy establishment at all. Indeed, other than this strange/unaccommodating behavior of staffs, I thought the hotel was pretty decent. I paid good money for it too. Hence the disappointment was there."
"A good hotel for our first visit to Chicago, good location to walk to everything you need and to get on a train and we felt safe in the area at night. It's approx 1hr from O'hare airport by train, one change required so not difficult and the same line will get you to the ball park too. Starbucks and bar in reception are convenient, rooftop bar is good but expensive. We went to Gino's next door for deep dish pizza, the hotel will give you a VIP pass to skip the queue and also a free entree! The bed at the hotel wasn't very comfortable and dipped in the middle and the safe wasn't usable nor fixed despite asking at reception a couple of times. I would still stay here again though."
"My first trip to Chicago and I went online to look for hotels. You never know what you're going to get so we were blown away with our room. Price was a big thing for us so it had to be reasonable. We arrived at the hotel well before the official check in time but they had a room ready for us and we were able to book in immediately. The room was on two levels, the first being an area with a desk / entrance area and the second being an open plan sitting room (yes I said a sitting room) and bedroom. The bathroom had a bath with an overhead shower. The three large windows overlooked the entrance of the hotel and although there was a lot of traffic below we were not disturbed by any outside noises. We were on the 21st floor. We were given the option of skipping the cleaning service for one day and in return we were given a discount at the restaurant in the hotel which we took advantage off. The staff at the reception were extremely helpful, even confirming our shuttle service arrangements on our behalf. The location of the hotel was ideal and close to bus stops / hop off hop on buses etc. This hotel was so much more than we ever expected! Will definitely go back there if ever I'm in Chicago again."
"This is a great hotel, perfectly situated just off the Magnificent Mile and within easy reach of all the main Chicago sights. The standard of the room was excellent; very spacious, a spotless bathroom, tea and coffee making facilities, comfortable bed, and we had a great view of the John Hancock Center between the buildings across the street. There is a couple of choices for breakfast; either in the restaurant or the cafe which serves affordable options. The only negative points to mention are that we had additional charges that were unexpected, and the air con system was very noisy in our room, I had to sleep with ear plugs in but slept well. Overall, this was the best hotel we stayed in on our USA/Canada trip, and would definitely return and recommend it."
"I agree with most of the positive reviews. The location is great, the rooms are nice, the staff is friendly, etc.My problem is with the ""Complimentary high-speed Internet access"" as stated on their website. Apparently, ""Complimentary"" means charging 5$ for Internet access. For a 4-night stay, we were charged 20$ for Internet access. I thought I had travelled back in time to the 90's. If you're going to charge for services, don't lie to potential customers on your website about ""Complimentary high-speed Internet access"".2 small things: The beds are on the soft side, so ask for a room with a new bed if you have a bad back. Also, the closet had a light triggered by a motion sensor and even with the (louvered) door closed, the light would turn on and illuminate the room during trips to the bathroom in the middle of the night."
"Great hotel! We came to spend the Easter holiday with our son and were able to get the ""Suite Perks"" package that provided valet parking and the St. Claire city view suite at a great price. The hotel is one block off Michigan Ave and three blocks from Lake Michigan. We walked everywhere and even rented the DVY bikes which was a blast. Our room was on the 20th floor and looked straight down St. Claire Street - it was a great city view and the suite was large and perfectly appointed. The bathroom itself was a little small but there was a large dressing table and stool separate from the bathroom where I could put all my hair stuff etc. The front desk staff was helpful and the bartenders were awesome. One morning we had the breakfast buffet which was delicious and reasonably priced and another day we just got coffee and muffins from the coffee bar. The rooftop bar had just opened so we were the only ones there on Thursday evening but Manny makes an awesome drink. My only complaint was that we had brought coffee mugs back from the breakfast buffet and wine glasses back from the bar to our room and housekeeping never picked them up - they just left the dirty glasses for three days. This hotel doesn't have room service so its not like you can just put a bunch of glasses outside your room."
Upon our arrival we were greeted by the two very helpful and friendly ladies at the front desk. They upgraded our room to a suite for the same price which was very nice. The room itself was nicely furnished with lots of drawer/cupboard space. Nice living room area. The bathroom had a great shower with lots of water pressure. Very comfortable bed. Nice clean rooms. The hotel was very clean. Extremely helpful staff. This was our first time in Chicago and basically picked the hotel fromTrip Advisor reviews. The reviews were right on because this hotel is in a great location. Within walking distance to almost everything. Would definately stay at this hotel again.
"We stayed at MileNorth for a weekend away with friends. Our check in was prompt even though there was a long line. The staff was very attentive, informative, and pleasant. Our room was very modern, roomy, and tidy. The decor was modern and the bed was comfortable. There were no problems with noise (even though there were a number of young cheerleaders in house as well). The fitness facility was small but clean. The equipment was in good repair and met my basic needs. As an early riser, it was nice to enjoy my Starbucks in the lobby in the mornings. The location is perfect! Everywhere we went was within walking distance. Magnificent mile shopping, great dining options, fun pubs, and Navy Pier. Also, only a short block or two walk to the Red Line for further transportation.We enjoyed Gino's East next door as well! Fabulous deep dish! Streeter's Tavern, and Pippins were fun pubs to stop by for a cocktail and relax during a day of shopping too! I would definitely stay here again in the future. The only criticism are the elevators. There are only two for 29 floors. The wait could be pretty long at times!


Room Tip: 22nd floor was great! Beware of long wait for elevators though...

"Stayed here for 5 nights with my wife and son - a fantastic experience.The hotel is very clean, very modern and close to everything you need. The staff were all fantastic, helpful and very friendly. Of particular note was one of the doormen, Joel, who really looked after us with recommendations on food, activities and oversll just made us feel very welcome. In the coffee shop (in the lobby) all the staff were great especially Jorge. Great food, coffee and service. As stated in previous reviews the hotel is right near Michigan Ave and there is a Walgreens just around the corner for those little things you might need. Our restaurant recommendations are Jake Melniks Pub, Grand Lux and Elephant and Castle Pub. As for Chicago airport transfers, if you want a very nice guy and reliable driver with a heap of room for your bags do yourself a favour and call Wallace he will definitely look after you: 773-972-5078We will definitely stay again as this is one of the best hotels we have ever stayed in. AAAA++++"
"1. Lobby is small--4 chairs, no lounge or fun bar atmosphere in lobby. Basic.2. Reservation for 4 rooms booked thru Trip Advisor/GetaRoom.com could not be located by the front desk. Really? 4 rooms!3. Price of room was good value.4. Rooms reminded me of Aloft--basic.5. Location is spectacular--close to it all. 6. No one at front desk wears a name tag--no one wants to be accountable.7. No one cares if you are a Hard Rock member if you booked thru Trip Advisor--only recognized if you book on Hard Rock's website.Average experience...close your eyes and you wouldn't know if you were at a Hard Rock or a basic chain hotel. Weird..since that is not my impression of the Hard Rock brand in other locales---feels like this location was an afterthought."
"I stayed here for 4 nights while on business. I was thoroughly impressed with the quality of the room and the overall amenities. Hotel:Room quality was greatService from staff was greatRestaurant was great for breakfast (a bit slow on service, but not a big deal to me)Bar had great serviceGym was good and open 24 hoursNearby:Good dinner at Mortons or other restaurantsGood location to other placesOverall I highly recommend this"
We stayed at the Hard Rock Hotel with our five year old daughter in April 2015. You couldn't ask for a better location in Chicago. The hotel staff were all very night and helpful. It was the other stuff that I really didn't care for. The hotel didn't have free wifi which I think is ridiculous in this day and age. Everyone has free wifi. The second thing that I didn't like was the bathroom. There wasn't really a large counter to put your things. That was a big nuisance.
"It's a weird combination of dark, matte minimalism with gilded art deco elevators, but the room was spacious, quiet, well laid out, bed was comfy, electrical outlets accessible, decent clock radio, good closet and mirror - those all earn big brownie points. The bathroom was clean, although the paint towards the bottom of the door was peeling heavily, and the shower had no pressure to speak of. The concierge and reception staff were very helpful and friendly.I had low expectations based on staying at a Hard Rock hotel in Vegas for a conference, but was pleasantly surprised!"
"This week was my first stay at a Hard Rock hotel property. I am a loyal Marriott customer but couldn't get into any of their properties in Chicago this week. I selected the Hard Rock pretty much by chance. I thoroughly enjoyed my stay. The staff was extremely courteous, the rooms clean and the location is right in the heart of everything. The hotel was fully booked yet I never felt that things were all that hectic or out of control. I recommend the Hard Rock in Chicago to anyone looking for a great hotel experience."
"Hard Rock Hotel in Chicago has a great location on the very South end of the Miracle Mile and about 1 block from Millennium Park. This is right in the heart of downtown Chicago. 2 blocks from the ""L"", 2 blocks from Intelligence Coffee, 1 block from the Chicago river, 2 blocks from awesome shopping and restaurants....can't really ask for a more convenient location.The people who work there are FRIENDLY! Very! The price is very reasonable and the building is a famous structure out side and very modern inside.My only complaint this from this trip is that the shower needed some slight mildew removal and could use a better shower head in the shower.I've stayed here many times now and as before...it ROCKED me once again!

"My husband and I stayed here for three nights! Its in a good location, lots of places to eat close by and we enjoyed the short walk to the main places. We had a room with a king size bed, it was very clean, but the room was pretty small. The bed was comfortable and you have a coffee pot in the room. There is no refrigerator that you can use or microwave. The bathroom was very small! There is no way two people can try and get ready at the same time...which was a problem for us! There is also a safe in the room! The staff was very nice and the hotel was very modern! All in all, we would stay here again!"
"The Hard Rock has proved to be an excellent choice for a father soon trip to Chicago. The location is great, on Michigan Avenue just between the Loop and the Magnificent Mile.The hotel is a beautiful historic sky scraper but it is just starting to show tiredness following its 2004 opening, a refurbishment (at least of the standard rooms) is needed. Front desk and housekeeping were good and non intrusive and because we were here for so long we were offered free internet access. Overall the Hard Rock Hotel is very good and if you can get a good rate then it is recommended but be aware there are better choices out there."
"My boyfriend and I wanted a place to stay for a weekend get away and thought this place would be different yet perfect for the location and just for the experience. I have to say, it was not worth it. Our room wasn't ready for 3 hours. Yes they gave us complimentary drinks at chucks (which is a great restaurant by the way), but we had reservations for dinner to go to later on the night which we had to change. They also offered us another room, but for 2 queen size beds when I paid for a king size bed room, I didn't accept. But when we finally got to ours room, it was still not worth the stay. The lampshade was damaged in our room and fridge had missing beverages, which I mentioned to the front desk just so I wasn't charged, which he said I won't be. While checking my balances on my statements after staying there, I was charged. I still haven't gotten my money back. It was frustrating and definitely not worth my money. While calling I was also handed over to 3 different associates and all gave me different stories about why I was charged. While I thought the workers were friendly, I didn't think they were very professional. I recommend staying somewhere else in the city of Chicago."
"I had several problems:1. I was not asked if I needed help with my luggage.2. The dresser in my room was damaged on both sides.3. The tile on my bathroom floor was loose.4. Room Service was closed on a Friday night and when I asked front desk about it, I was told to walk to 7/11 to get something to eat.5. I was locked out of my room at least 30 minutes prior to check out and had to wait several minutes causing me to check out 20 minutes late. -As a result of being locked out, I missed my train and was delayed 5 hours. I also had to pay a $45 charge when I traded my ticket in after missing my original train.-When I called and complained, Will was not apologetic. He blamed me for the key not working. He said that I must have had it with my credit cards.-After getting no where with Will, I asked for the corporate number, he told me that I could call corporate but they are not going to do anything to help me, so I should just talk to him."
"The Hard Rock in Chicago is an excellent location. Just south of the Chicago river and one block away from the magnificent mile makes this hotel the perfect location. There are many restaurants and shopping within a short walking distance. The hotel itself is clean, comfortable and the staff is friendly. I would recommend booking parking ahead of time as the hotel does offer parking however, it is 60 dollars per day and you can find better rates if you are willing to walk a few blocks. Wifi is available however there is a charge per night per device. I asked and the front desk gave me complimentary Wifi for two devices. I would definitely recommend this hotel."
"For the second portion of our trip, I decided to stay at the Hard Rock Hotel Chicago for a third time. As you may know, many of the floors of this hotel have a musician theme. The first time, I stayed on the AC/DC floor. The second was the Elvis floor. This time, we ended up on the B.B. King floor. (I'm still holding out for the Cheap Trick floor, having seen them in concert back home in Fort Wayne last summer.)Much of what I mentioned from my previous review two years ago still stands. The service is still excellent, and I have to give a nod to Zack at the front desk for checking us out in a fast manner so we could make our train back to Indiana on-time. The rooms are still very clean and spacious, and there's now some new fun touches like a shag pillow. The beds are still some of the best that I have slept on in a hotel. The shower experience was still great, with good water pressure, great toiletries, and thick towels. There's still a Keurig in the room - remember, if you have a certain kind of K-Cups that you like, you can use them.But I'd like to touch on three new subjects. The first one is Chuck's at breakfast. Last time I was here, I had lunch there, and I decided to try them for breakfast. I had an amazing melt-in-your-mouth waffle, and my father had the Red Velvet Pancakes that he loved, too. The second is their on-site gym, which I used for the first time on this visit. It's small, but it makes up for the size with really good equipment like high-tech treadmills and Nautilus systems. Spa services are also available, but I didn't use them. The third is Verizon reception. Last time I was here, I had AT&T, and Ma Bell's reception was perfect, while my mother had good results with Sprint as well. But Verizon's reception here requires you to be near a window to get good call quality. I just wanted to give this as a public service announcement for all the Verizon users.Overall, this was another great visit to the Hard Rock Hotel. Will I be back for a fourth time? You can bet on it."
"This was my first time staying at a Hard Rock Hotel and it was an awesome experience. Friendly staff, clean rooms, and a great location for tourists. The concierge were great at filling us in with all of the local places to go and things to do. Parking was confusing if you didn't use the valet service but, it was still a great distance from the hotel. I will definitely be staying again.


Room Tip: If you need help with finding your way around ask the concierge ! They were great !

"By the photos you'd assume it was close to immaculate but it is not. I booked a King Tower room, which is a king size bed in a bi-level room I suppose but the one I was given was not impressive. The bed was a full/queen and it was less than 2ft from the door. There were 3 steps down into an area with a couch and a table (?), just a poor design all around yet the hotel staff, with big bright smiles assured me I'd love it. I didn't love it and they kindly changed me to another room immediately. Although the bathrooms in both rooms were just fantastic, the wear and tear on the hotel is noticeable. Expected better from the Hard Rock but I guess 4 star ratings don't mean much anymore. Staff and location was excellent by the way, close to many restaurants and just steps away from the shops on Michigan ave.


Room Tip: Don't fall for the Tower rooms, especially on the 36th floor.

"My boyfriend and I stayed there for St. Patrick's weekend. It was abnormally warm so we tried to turn the AC on. To our surprise, they had not turned their coolers on so there was no AC. We had to crack the window. Then at night it gets cold so we turn the heat on, but the electric heat had not been on in about a year, per the engineer, and it was burning the dust off which caused a horrible smell and the fire alarm to go off. Needless to say, do not stay there during this time of the year. Not worth what we paid."
"My fiance and I stayed here for a date night. We arrived Saturday afternoon, went up to the room and then went to dinner. The floors each have a theme. We were on the Elvis floor in a corner room. When we got off the elevator, it smelled like pot a little, but we are young so that didn't bother us. We were able to take 5 minute cabs every where because it was chilly this weekend! It is in a great location. We went down to the bar for a drink and also went to the gift shop to get some stuff for our family. The rooms are smaller, but cozy! We loved the theme of our room and our king size bed was perfect for us! We took a cab to RPM and to the beach to go watch the Polar Plunge. It was fun!"
"Went to Chicago for a couple of days with my 10 year old daughter. We really enjoyed this hotel! It is in a great location off of Michigan Ave, we walked to everything. The staff was very helpful and friendly. The housekeeper on the 7th floor was so nice to my daughter and greeted us in the hallway overtime we went to our room. We had a corner room with a great view of the water and street. The room was nice and spacious for Chicago and clean. We also loved that you could have an electric guitar delivered to the room for free and play ping pong in the lobby.


Room Tip: There is construction going on across the street. Starting at 7:30am. Had a corner room and never...

"My husband and I stayed in room 1104 the weekend before Christmas. BEAUTIFUL corner room! We were celebrating my 40th birthday that weekend and had an amazing time. Room was clean. The first night I was woken up by the person next door blasting music, after two hours ( Don't want to be the old woman next door complaining) but I called down to front desk and with in a few minutes someone was up to our floor knocking on their door. So why do I give a one star rating when everything was great? I brought my VERY EXPENSIVE leather jacket that weekend. When I unpacked I hung it in the closet. The day we were checking out we woke up late and rushed to get packed so we could check out on time. Now...I used to be in the hotel business, so it's really important to have guests check out on time because of the time it takes to clean rooms. Well, I rushed so fast to be a good guest that I had totally forgot to grab my leather jacket out of the closet. I called a few days later AND WOULD YOU BELIEVE housekeeping hadn't found anything.....gee. I used to find gold watches and jewelry way more expensive then my jacket and I always turned it in. I will never stay at this hotel or any other Hard Rock. If this is the staff you hire and trust then I want NO PART OF IT.Happy friggen 40th birthday to me! Had that jacket for years! GONE! In one failed attempt to be on time. Lesson learned."
"We booked one night at this hotel to follow an event in Chicago. We had to valet the car- it was pricey at 60.00- but good till 5pm the next day. Super helpful concierge, desk guys and car, baggage guys. The room was sparse but comfortable. Looked a little worn out. Great view of the river though. If you are a Hard Rock Rewards member you get points and later check out which was a plus. The hotel in Chicago does not have a Hard Rock restaurant attached but does have a nice shop."
"last weekend we had a stay at the hard rock hotel chicago and i would like to say it was good. the room was comfortable with comfy beds, but found a few glitches (didn't really bother me)...lights sconces between the beds were loose and and the fridge was not stocked with pop...didn't feel like getting tipsy that night. the bathroom was nice and well appointed with lots of towels and toiletries by rock spa. the lobby was small and nicely furnished with groovy chairs and even a ping pong table while you wait. the angel and king bar was dark...a bit dark and felt it was more of a cougar bar (no offense) and found it was not a place for hip younger people to hang out in (i think it was the sub-freezing temperatures outside keeping them away)...the history of the building is unique and the black granite tiles on the outside were all pulled off and replaced in better condition after an expensive refurbishment. the 1929 built tower top has the crown covered in a thin layer of 24 karat gold leaf and looks, as popular legend says (from the book in the room)...connects the design of the building to a champagne bottle, with the terra cotta exterior corresponding to the green glass bottle and the golden tower alluding to the shiny foil top. each floor of the hotel represents each rock star we have and do know of...some floors, like ours were left in its original 1930's condition feeling like an office worker when we walked out onto the 13th floor for our room

"The Hard Rock Chicago is in a great old building right in the loop. You can't miss it with the green and gold accents, it really stands out. Inside it's very modern, upscale and trendy. Each floor is dedicated to a different musician. We had a corner room which had great views of the city. The location can't be beat and the rooms are bigger than average for Chicago. They often offer great rates (less than $175 per night) so keep your eyes open."
"This hotel is your average 4 star (minus) place with hardly any Hard Rock feeling. The room I got on the 22nd floor was small, run down, minimally decorated, less than nothing special.The hotel has no Hard Rock Cafe just a very average restaurant with more than average prices.I was offered a room upgrade at a discounted price prior to my arrival but the upgrade was not available by the time I got there.When I asked for room cleaning, hung the sign on the door and left for 5 hours, the room was not cleaned. Sure enough after I got back, took off the sign 5 minutes later they knocked on my door so they wanted to clean it.Last day the coffee was not replaced.The Hard Rock Hotel in Macau and Biloxi are way way better, this one is not worth it."
"Just stayed here for 2 nights with some friends while in town for a concert. We all stayed in studio suite rooms and thought they were a great value ($149 through a discount travel website) given the size of the room and the location right on Michigan Avenue. We were overall happy with our stay, but did encounter a few issues, the biggest of which was some random thumping noises which continued throughout the night and kept one of our friends from sleeping (didn't bother me, but I'm a heavy sleeper). Our rooms were on two separate floors and we all heard the noise. Although the front desk staff claimed not to know the cause (which we found hard to believe), they were very accommodating and changed rooms. There was no noise in the new room. The hotel bar was a bit of a strange place. Not enough seating and overpriced small drinks, but I guess that's the case at most hotel bars. We liked the DJ though. We'd still stay there again if we're back in town, especially if we can get a good deal again."
"Stayed for 6 nights in Feb.Corner room in the tower had great views, super comfortable bed and large bathroom. Room was cleaned spotlessly every day too. The free Wi-Fi was welcome, though it ran out part way through my stay and reception had no vouchers, so incurred a $40-odd fee for the remaining three days, which reception refunded on check-out. Interesting touches included being able to order a guitar from reception - nice!, and the toiletries and magazines in the room were also a great addition. Staff were excellent across the board, a real credit to the hotel, particularly when my flight was cancelled due to the weather and I needed to add an extra night.Room did have flaws though - The wardrobe didn't close correctly (but wouldn't stay open either!), The power points in the room are all at floor level and mainly under / behind furniture so hard to access, & the safe is also at floor level so you'll have to sit on the floor to programme the code whilst holding the wardrobe door open.... Wasn't advised at check-in that my VIP loyalty card couldn't be used (due to not booking directly with the hotel - I used Hotels.com as their prices were far better than any quoted by the hotel). Emailed their HQ about this, and received an officious & rulebook-quoting reply from a corporate drone that would be better suited to working in insurance. Luckily the Hotel Manager was on the ball and rectified the situation quickly & professionally.

"We stayed outside of the city for a few days and splurged on this hotel for the night. My friends and I left from Chicago on a bus back to Memphis that wasn't leaving until late that evening. The men at the front desk went against policy to hold our bags for us behind the desk so we wouldn't have to cary them around the city all day! It was wonderful. Pete Wentz was also staying at the hotel that night. Unfortunately, we didn't get to meet him. but the idea was cool! Wonderful, clean, comfortable rooms with a great view. Right in the center of the city, and a great location. Great place to stay!!!"
"This wasn't my choice of hotels. I'm 71 and came to Chicago to meet up with a group of younger friends to attend a concert. As a place to sleep and shower, it met my expectations.... comfortable bed, clean bathroom and the room was overall clean... smart choice for vinyl upholstered chairs in rooms... greasy upholstery is gross. The restaurant and bar were bland, the food average and the prices above average. The lobby was small, the seating uncomfortable and the space wasn't well utilized. What was outstanding was the quality of folks working there from housekeeping, bellmen, front desk to concierge. Room Service however, was horrible. We called to place orders off the menu. They said they would call right back for our order and after 45 minutes they still hadn't called to even take our order ! We had to leave so called back to tell them not to bother. However, having said that, if my friends wanted to stay there again, I would be quite willing to join them. Since there are few rooms on each floor, we had an entire floor which was great as we might have disturbed other guests were that not the case..."
"My stay at the Hard Rock was brief, but excellent! While working downtown, I needed a hotel for a few hours of sleep. I also needed assistance to get that few hours of sleep. Not only was the hotel in great shape compared to other outdated Chicago hotels, but they upgraded me without even asking. I needed to find a way to print out a sign for the next morning. They at first told me about the business center, but then inquired if they could help. While unpacking, they printed a couple signs for me, in a few different fonts, just in case I liked one over the other. What other hotel does that for you??? My phone was dead with no way of charging, as the stay was unexpected. The same person let me use his personal charger!! What hotel does that?? Needless to say, they made a fan out of the Hard Rock Hotel! Next time, I am hoping to come back and actually enjoy the hotel."
"We stayed at the Hard Rock Hotel on 2/21 & 2/22/15. We had a room on the 8th floor - the Cheap Trick floor. It was a basic, plain Jane room (2 queens), not much to speak of for a view. The hotel was running a winter special, so we only paid $89/night for the room. For that rate, I was content with the room, but if I had paid full price, I would have been been very disappointed. The positives: the room was clean, the bed very comfortable, and the staff was pleasant. The negatives: the credenza had seen better days (scratched up and one of the doors wouldn't close properly), the door had a crack in the bottom as if someone had tried to kick the door in, the windows were drafty so the room never got really warm (it was fine for sleeping though). When we pulled one of the blinds down, the hook pulled out of the wall and the whole thing fell down (we were told we wouldn't be charged for it). The hotel has a great location - 2 blocks from Millenium park, a 20 to 25 minute walk from Union Station, a reasonable walk to Navy Pier, and plenty of bars and restaurants within walking distance. If I could get the same great price, I would stay here again, but I wouldn't pay $200+ for the room we had. We did ask for an upgrade, but were told none were available.Also note, if you are a light sleeper, you probably won't sleep well with the general ongoing noise of the city. I suspect this is normal for many hotels downtown though. We did not have any issues with noises from other guests though.We didn't eat at the restaurant, but had a few drink's at the restaurant's bar. Drinks were average price for downtown Chicago and the staff was friendly."
"$99 for a room on Michigan Avenue on a Saturday! Too good to be true, right? Right. Side-street was blocked off with a huge crane parked in the middle of the side street. We thought, well it's the weekend, they won't be working, right? Wrong. 7 a.m. Sunday morning, the banging and clanking started. Very loud, impossible to sleep in. No mention from the hotel, no apology, nothing. Very disappointed. Regardless of the construction, the rooms are NOT AT ALL sound-proof. Police and fire sirens could be heard throughout the night. Windows were so drafty. Spend a few bucks more and go some place else. (Bed was very comfy though so if you're a heavy sleeper, you might be ok. Shower water pressure was great)."
"The Hard Rock Hotel in Chicago turned out to be a wonderful place to stay for our Chicago visit. From check-in to check-out we were very satisfied with our stay. We had a late check-in and the front desk person, Will, was very friendly and helpful. The room was spacious and clean and nicely decorated. The chair for the desk was extremely comfortable - that was important because I worked from my room 2 of the days I was there. The concierge was very helpful in finding something fun to do the last day of my stay. Bed was comfy and warm - this was also important because it was January and in the single digits while we were there. We would stay again without a doubt."
"Booked on their site and saved $50.00 a night with a non-refundable reservation. Had a really nice room with King bed and a view of the river for $100.00 a night. Staff was very friendly, Hotel was very clean, right on the M-Mile and only 2 blocks from the south shore. Everything I would expect from a 5 star hotel.... My only thing was... why put the desk infrot of the window with the view.. so we moved it lol Yup- this is where I'll be staying every time."
"Hotel room was a nice decent size. The shower only has half a door which causes the whole bathroom to flood. Front desk employees were not really welcoming, however house keeping was amazing. I didn't get her name, which I regret but she was sooo friendly. She greated everyone walking past her and was so kind. I called to order breakfast for room service and the female that answered said that she'll call me back. Waited about 10 minutes and decided to get Grub Hub delivery....because she never called back, at all. Received a $20 fee for some reason...haven't followed up on it but i definetly will just because of the overall poor customer service."
"Just spent two nights in this hotel. We were very pleasantly surprised, as we thought that because of the name it would be noisy, and it wasn't. Our room was a nice size, as was the bathroom. And, very clean. The bed was comfy. Staff friendly and helpful. My only complaint is that they have this strange sensor thing with the mini-bar, so it you move anything around in it, you're charged. I didn't see the sign saying that, so put something I needed to stay cool into the mini bar, moving some things around well doing so. We were charged, but the charges were removed from our bill with no problem. From my conversation with person at reception, this appears to be a common occurrence, so they might want to consider getting rid of the sensor thing."
"The room was starting to show age. I stayed in your hotel when it first opened and it had a completely different hip lively vibe. The rooms were new. The bathroom this time had a shower with a cheap shower head. The grout was aged and fallen out in areas. The shower leaked all over the bathroom floor and out into the hallway soaking the carpet and getting our socks wet. It also had rusted the bottom of the bathroom door.The walls were not well sound proofed. I could hear every conversation coming from the room to the back of the headboard. The other adjoining room had a couple there for the hip hop event and they fought and swore all night long. The hallways smelled of pot smoke and were loud.The lobby in the morning was full of hip hop performers crashed on every inch of furniture with coats draped over there heads sleeping. It created a really ""strange"" environment for an upscale hotel.At check out again they wanted to charge me for the room. It was very annoying.The valet service was not very friendly at check in. Seemed very short and matter of fact about the service and how it worked to get ones car."
"I have been coming to Chicago for the past 5 years and I have been staying in different Hotels ( which ever has the best deal). I found a Groupon for The Hard Rock and wanted to stay there. I was absolutely amazed by the size of the room. Normally Chicago Hotel rooms are smaller, but this was great. The beds were super comfortable, the room was clean, and the bathroom was very updated! I will definitely be trying to stay here whenever I come back. The Restaurant was great, and the stay was super friendly."
"Better location than some of the more expensive hotels on Michigan Ave, because it's a little closer to the parks, but still right in the heart of everything. No complaints at all about the actual hotel, room was nice, and very roomy compared to other Chicago hotels we have stayed at, considering the price was better I was surprised at the large size of the room. The only thing that wasn't the greatest was that the concierge wasn't exactly super interested in helping us out with activities and recommendations. We took his lack of enthusiasm with a grain of salt and figured out our own stuff to do. All in all, a great visit to Chicago, and we would definitely stay here again if the price continues to be more competitive than other hotels on the street!

"Had a great stay at Hard Rock. Very unique. The room was great, nicely furnished with great views from beautiful, big windows (stayed in platinum king room). Price was right through Travel Zoo. I read a review that mentioned rooms were dated - not so - they are intentionally decorated and the look is not dated but has a particularly unique feel specifically designed for Hard Rock. As part of the welcome binder in the room there is a list of rock memorabilia that can be found on each floor. A must-do while there. And the history of the building is also described. Also check out the unrenovated floors (mentioned on same list). So cool. Delicious dinner at Chuck's A Kerry Simon Kitchen - an Iron Chef winner and connected to the hotel. Restaurant is beautiful inside, very relaxing with the tones and lighting. I'm a local and stayed here when my anniversary plans to travel to WI got foiled by a blizzard. We took the CTA, an easy walk to the hotel from the blue line Clark/Lake stop. This is the line that comes/goes straight to Chicago's O'Hare airport. Check-in and check-out were a breeze. No trouble with noise, but I did stay during a weeknight. Great location for visitors."
"I stayed here for two nights in December and had a wonderful stay. B/c of the flash deal prices though their mailing list, I ended up booking a Tower Suite. Fantastic views from the 33rd floor. Comfortable bedding. Quiet b.c not many rooms on the floor. Staff was very friendly and check in was easy. Temperature was too warm though. This has been a pattern when I stay in hotels in the winter. AC didn't appear to be an option (temp went up when we turned on air) so we ended up having to open the windows to sleep (37 degrees out) which did get loud when ambulances went by. I have one suggestion for management - add another shelf in the bathroom. The bathroom itself was huge but there wasn't much space for toiletries, esp for two people. The bar had good deals on a Monday, but for the love of god, you have to play better music. We could only stand it for one drink. Sam Smith? Music did not fit the ""hard rock"" image they are going for."
"Ever since we saw the lobby and exterior of the Hard Rock Hotel in Chicago we have been eager to try it out. Unfortunately, our recent 3 night stay, although reasonably priced, was a let down. The service is competent and the lobby remains beautiful, but the intervening years have not been kind to the rooms. What was probably stylish gray/black/white decor is now just a bit grim, with many disappointments. Heavily marked up walls, a leaky toilet, a dark entry way all added up to a gloomy atmosphere. If someone can explain the though process behind the big box closet jutting out into the room I would like to hear it. If you do stay here insist on a room without adjoinign doors as the sound carries through the doors as if they were paper. Likewise, the hallway noise penetrates the rooms"
"The reason for my surprise originates from the fact that I don't like Hard Rock Cafes. I think they're classless, touristy, soulless bars with overpriced drinks and burnt to a crisp food. So after purchasing a good deal on Groupon to stay at the Hard Rock Hotel for a weekend away in Chicago I was apprehensive.So I'm happy to report that this hotel elevates away from my previous Hard Rock bar experiences.Located in a great spot a couple of blocks from Millennium Park and housed in a grandiose tower, the hotel had efficient check-in/out, modern lobby, good room service and comfy bed. Yes the noise from the emergency sirens on the streets were a little too frequent and yes, seeing a skimpy Madonna outfit display each time we exited the elevator on floor 10 was slightly weird but at least the hotel was sharp around the edges, clean, and had a bit of character. Solid 4 stars. I'd stay here again although preferably in a room without a giant picture of Radiohead staring down at me as I sleep."
"This hotel is literally in the perfect location! Steps away from the Metra, steps away from dining and shops, steps away from Millennium Park. Great price, great quality rooms, nice decor and amenities. Perfect for young and mid-aged adults. Satellite TV sucked, but that wasn't an important amenity when there's so much else to do downtown. The bar seemed nice and it turned into a club/lounge atmosphere after hours. I will definitely stay there again and recommend it to all friends and family."
"I stayed at the Hard Rock Hotel during a one-night stopover in Chicago. It's a pretty nicely themed, modern hotel with pictures, wallpaper and memorabilia paying homage to famous rock icons. I checked in on a Thursday night and there was a band performing.When I booked, I had requested for a room in the tower (if available). Fortunately, there was one available and if you stay at the Hard Rock, I recommend getting a room in the tower. It gives you breathtaking views of downtown Chicago.The folks at the concierge were pretty friendly and very professional. Even though I had lived in Chicago for the better part of the last decade, the guy at the desk who checked me in gave some pretty good suggestions on things to do in Chicago on a Thursday night.My room was pretty sizeable and its walls, in line with the ambiance in the bar and the lobby, was littered with rock iconography.Highly recommended."
"I chose the Hard Rock Chicago for its location - about half-way between the Magnificent Mile and a college my daughter and I were visiting. ( The Hard Rock is located on the corner of N. Michigan Ave. and Wacker Pl.) We could not have been happier with the location choice! We were also about 2 blocks from Millennium Park. Easy walk practically anywhere we wanted to go in the city. As added bonuses, there was a Giordano's Pizzeria within sight distance of the hotel and a Garrett's Popcorn about a block away - two of our favorite places to visit in Chicago! The hotel itself gives off a modern, fun vibe. You cannot go wrong with a photo of Sting on his motorcycle in your bathroom! Each floor is themed with a different musical artist, and there is a glass case with each artist's memorabilia on their floor. We had a lot of fun stopping on different floors to see. Our room on the 22nd floor faced north on N. Michigan Ave., so we had a fantastic view of the Trump Tower, The Wrigley Building, the Chicago River and The Hancock Building. My only complaint with the room was that the lighting was a little dim. The natural light from the window was great, but when the curtains were closed it would have been nice to have more lighting in the room. Lastly, we were really impressed with the entire staff at The Hard Rock Hotel! The front desk staff was super friendly and helpful! Everyone we encountered from the housekeeping staff to the bell staff were courteous and warm. We would definitely stay at the Hard Rock Chicago again!

"As senior citizens, we approached this hotel with a bit of trepidation since it was our understanding that The Hard Rock brand catered to a certain age specific clientele.At the Chicago Hard Rock Hotel this was not the case. We were pleasantly surprised by the quiet atmosphere of the hotel and specifically the 22nd floor where our room was located.The room itself was certainly adequate for our needs and the view of Michigan Avenue was terrific..Although there were some glitches with the heating/cooling system the first evening,a service person quickly arrived and remedied the problems. Most importantly, the hotel is located within an easy walk to the Art Institute and Millennium Park and only two blocks away from the shops and restaurants on Michigan Avenue.The weather cooperated and we spent a very enjoyable weekend. Finally, the rate (even for a January in Chicago) we obtained was very good. We certainly would consider staying there again if we could obtain a similar room rate.


Room Tip: We were advised that the higher the floor, the quieter the room. It worked for us

"Spent a Saturday and Sunday night here with my husband and baby. I have stayed at this hotel once before several years ago and was happy with it then. This stay was very nice as well. We chose a king room with a city view and ended up being at the very end of building which was nice and made for very little noise from neighboring rooms. The room was very clean and well appointed. The only exception was the mini bar. It was clear that the previous occupants of the room must have used the fridge to store leftovers because it smelled a little icky, kind of like pickles. I wanted to have a drink from the fridge, but chose not to because of the smell. I'm sure this would have been remedied if I had reported it, but I never called about it. I feel that this should have been checked/cleaned prior to our arrival. My only other (small) complaint, and this may sound strange, is that the king sized bed seemed small. I have a king size at home so I'm very used to what it feels like and how much space you have with two people in there, and this felt quite smaller. I laid across the bed width wise and covered almost the whole thing, head to toe, and I'm only five feet tall (60 inches). A standard king I believe is 72 or 76 inches. Otherwise, had a very comfortable stay. Be advised that valet parking is $60 per night with in and out privileges. We went this route because it was easiest. All parking in the city is quite expensive - I believe the cheapest I heard of was $42 for the night, so be sure to plan on spending a bit on parking whether you valet or self park.I enjoyed my stay here and would stay here again on future visits to Chicago."
If you splurge on suite prepare for disappointment rooms are dated could use paint and new furniture. Bathroom is large but has tiny shower looks nothing like website photos. Bed was comfortable views were great service fantastic but consdering I paid $60 for parking and $300 on a room I expected the room to be much better quailty. The spa is also nonexsistant so to speak. I would stay again if I got a room on special but Id never pay full price.
"I always try to stay at Hard Rock. I was shooting for that hip and modern feel; but got creepy grandamas house.Location is unmatched. Viewes are impossible to beat. And staff is as good as it gets. Room however is very dated and the newly renovated suite I stayed in needs needs to re-renovated! Paint coming off ceiling, I guess it's historic,but the woodwork is scratched and dinged so it looks pretty bad. But the positive on the wood, is the thin layer of dust hides the small scuff marks. New shower leaked into the bathroom floor. Thick quarter sized spiders kept showing up; bathroom, windows, closets, etc. Fridge didn't work, but that can happen anywhere. And TV's are on satellite.. So, if it's even a little cloudy; no tv signal. Forget it if it's snowing!"
"Just stayed at the Hard Rock in Chicago. It's a compact hotel that is close to all things downtown. The staff were very helpful and overly friendly. I enjoyed it as it was within close walking distance to many attractions, restaurants and galleries. Its not as lavish as other Hard Rocks I've stayed at but was happy nonetheless. I would stay again. It was a good value for money spent as well. The lack of free WiFi was a down point. Should be something that is standard these days. If the Comfort Inn can provide it the Hard Rocks should be able to. The hotel building, the Carbide and Carbon building was pretty cool, and nice that most of the original designs have been kept."
I stayed 7 nights at hard rock and had a pleasant time. The staff was nice and ready to assist you on whatever you need. The room and bathroom are big and has all space you need to accommodate your stuff. They also let me a late check out with no charges it really rocked thank you !!! Chuck's restaurant is alsonice and serves delicious plates. I am certainly will stay there on my next trip to Chicago.
"Hard Rock Hotel was great! Nothing was too much trouble ... they managed to find me a room with view of river, they also let me check in early (at 7am in the morning), and out late!! Good bar for a drink and a dance, and excellent location for all the downtown things... 2 mins walk from the first trolley stop (for hop-on/off bus) and the start of Magnificent Mile and 5 mins to the park!Some fixtures/fittings in the room were a little tired, but very comfortable!"
"As much as I love downtown Chicago, my first stay here was the best. We're celebrating our 30th Anniversary and the girl said we had a great view......not so much. We can see a little of Michigan Ave, but you'd have to hang out the window to see the river. Just a little disappointed when you've spent so much money to stay downtown. May try somewhere else next time if the price is comparable. It will be a great time, just wish the room was a little better. EVERYONE is very kind and helpful though. The concierge and valet are top notch. We have a lot of of fun kidding with them. Thanksgiving Day parade in the morning and Michael Jordan restaurant for a late Thanksgiving dinner."
"My flight was cancelled due to weather and all of the hotels close to ORD were booked so I found a special rate available on Travel Zoo for this hotel. Booking on the TZ website was very easy and saved a lot of money. The hotel location was very convenient. It was a few blocks from the red line metro and approximetely 4 blocks from the blue line so I walked despite the cold and wind typical of Chicago in the winter. The blue line from Clark/Lake was approximately 1 hour to ORD. There were multiple restaurants within walking distance as well as a Walgreens and 7-11 like store. I didn't care much for the modern rock themed decor but the room was large with the basics, chair and desk/chair with multiple outlets.The room had a stocked refrigerator with sensors that would automatically charge your account if the item was moved so I was afraid to put my bottle of water in the refrigerator. The room had heavy drapes that really blocked out the noise from the street and planes and the cold. The bed was also comfortable so I had no problems sleeping. The room also had a safe. I didn't have to wait for the elevators despite being on one of the upper floors. I didn't have much of a view; it was the back of the another hotel. The hotel did have a restaurant/bar but I did not eat there. It seemed crowded but I think a lot of guests stayed in due to the weather. The front desk staff was friendly. I was surprised that they offered free wifi but I did not take advantage of it. They had additional wifi high speed packages available for a fee. Of course there was a charge for parking but since I did not have a car I am not sure of the price. This resort was across from the Wyndham Grand and was a block from the river."
"It was a nice hotel, the beds were lovely and it's in a continent location. For the price I paid I wasn't thrilled, the staff didn't go out of their way to recommended anything and they ""forgot"" initially that we used the Wi the Fi not Package, although they did give us the cards once it was mentioned. Overall it was nice, nothing really stood out or made me scream amazing but location and the overall cleanliness of the room was nice."
"Stayed at the Hard Rock Hotel Chicago during my recent visit (Nov. 13-15) and enjoyed it very much. My flight out of California was delayed several times which delayed my check in for the day, but it was still a breeze to check in when I finally got there. Room was large & the bed was comfortable, pillows were super fluffy and amazing as well (especially after a long day of traveling). Bathroom was decently sized as well! TV has good channels and the room came with complimentary wifi (which I believe is only available complimentary if you book directly through their website, but I could be wrong)Housekeeping did a good job making sure the room was clean & restocked the following day. LOCATION LOCATION LOCATION!!! Couldn't have asked for a better location, right by Millennium Park & right down the street from Magnificent Mile where you can go shop your heart out (which I did). I should have stopped by Millennium Park as it was the same weekend that the outdoor ice skating rink opened up but because I've been there before, it wasn't first on my to-do list, I quickly regretted that the moment I found out that it was the first weekend the ice rink was open! Oh well, I will be making a stop there the next time I'm in Chicago (next month). Anyway, sidetracked for a second, there are also of plenty of good eats within the area, and if it's too cold & you'd prefer to order some delivery food, some places within the area can deliver to your room & the hotel allows this, which is awesome. They do also provide room service, but didn't take advantage of it.My last evening there, I did stop and have dinner at Chuck's: A Kerry Simon Kitchen, which was AMAZING. I'm almost glad it wasn't a Hard Rock Cafe! The food was delicious and the service (Kerianne took care of us, I did also write a review for this restaurant and mentioned her as well, so go and read my review on the food & service!) was even better. Couldn't have asked for a better last evening at my stay here. I know staying on Michigan Ave. is a little expensive, however, I did get this room on a KILLER DEAL!! So that's definitely a PLUS. Would stay here if the chance arises & the price point is right!Enjoy."
"This hotel is centrally located in Chicago - the loop and the magnificent mile are all within walking distance of the hotel is also extremely close to quite a few parks and opposite the hotel is in very handy bus station that will take you to most parts of ChicagoThe staff are extremely friendly and the hotel is very clean, The rooms are of average size for a hotel but if you ask to stay in the tower upon checking in and make a donation you get to stay on the higher floors.The higher floors mean you get a bit more wind noise, the plus side is though that you get spectacular views of Chicago which ever side of the hotel your room happens to be on.The restaurant in the hotel is also really good for breakfast and evening meal as the proportions are quite normal for British people because usually I find USA portions a little bit large.The concierge in this hotel is amazing they don't mind taking a couple of minutes to explain things to do in the best way to get there.Nothing bad against the hotel but if you do go in January February expected to be extremely cold."
"I had a great weekend getaway, and overall had no complaints. The hotel and hotel rooms were clean. It has a modern minimalistic design, however it is an older hotel and the wear is visible. All hotel staff were welcoming, friendly and eager to help. Checking was really fast, I asked for a quiet room and they were able to accommodate me. Although I booked the room through Hotwire secret rate, I got a room on the 23rd floor with a view. The rooms are average size, there are 4 star hotels in the area with smaller rooms. It has the best location, right in the center of downtown with plenty of good restaurants and bars. It is also 5 min away from magnificent mile and if you want to do any shopping.I Wouldn't recommend it for a business trip.


Room Tip: Higher floors are less noisy. If you have any preferences ask nicely when you check in, and most li...

"I stayed here 3 nights. I thought the corner room King was nice. The two queens I saw looked like any other room in a average hotel. The lobby was sparse and small. I thought the employees were helpful and friendly. . Breakfast restaurant was understaffed and very slow. I ate there once and the next two mornings went across the street to the Bagel shop. The internet was slow and didn't seem to work that great on the 13th floor. This is in the Carbide building which is very beautiful from the outside but not much on the inside. It is short walking distance to several great restaurants and shops (Magnificent Mile). The beds were comfortable but the temperature in the room was difficult to get right. I did not like the TV it was very slow and constantly had images referring.


Room Tip: Try a higher floor for a better view. Probably above the 22nd floor would have been better.

"My wife and I drove to Chicago recently for a shopping trip on Michigan Avenue and decided to stay at the Hard Rock Hotel. It was awesome! Great location, reasonable rates and outstanding service (the concierge directed us to two different restaurants which were excellent choices). We will return!


Room Tip: If possible, get a room high up and facing Michigan Avenue. Those rooms have the best views!

"Spent two nights recently to watch the US/NZ rugby match at Soldier Field. The hotel is very conveniently located to many cultural and nightlife spots in the city. It was a very short walk (4 blocks maybe) from the blue line train to the hotel which saved a considerable amount on transportation. The concierge gave excellent advice on restaurants and bars as well as nearby touristy attractions. The rooms were clean, housekeeping was attentive. We were missing a television remote and maintenance replaced it within minutes. All downtown hotels are pricey, but I would choose this again if I wanted to be downtown.


Room Tip: Higher floors have restricted key card access which might be a nice additional safety bonus. Third...

"I was staying at the hotel to babysit the infant of one of the attendants standing up for a wedding hosted at the hotel. Desk staff, check in and location were great, loved the room but I was pretty much a captive in it with a young infant. I called room service 3 times over the course of about 90 minutes trying to order something for me and the baby. Each time the call was answered by Guest Services who said my call to In-Room Dining would be returned shortly. My calls were never returned. Clearly the hotel was under-staffed and I wish they'd just stepped up to the plate and said ""it's not gonna happen"" and told me (from out of town) where to call for pizza or something."
"I've never felt like a hotel was out to take my money more than this hotel. From the miscommunication and inconsistent pricing of the group rate vs the extra nights we stayed, to the motion-sensor mini-bar (make sure you check your bill if you store your own stuff in the small mini-fridge ... you move a Miller Lite, and you're auto-charged even if you didn't remove it from the fridge!) to the emails about getting upgrades, the Hard Rock Hotel seemed to want my money more than to make my stay really rock. The communication was awful. Mostly, the bride was so disappointed with the lack of communication & the royal screw ups! The service in Chuck's, the restaurant at the lobby, was awful -- so slow, so miserable. The bathrooms are dark and make it hard to prep for a wedding -- unless you want to look like Courtney Love's bad years. Hard Rock needs to clean up its act in order to be a really great place -- like it has the potential to be. There are good parts about the hotel -- it's in a beautiful and historic building. Each floor is dedicated to a rock star. You can rent a Fender and take lessons from a video played on an in-room TV channel. The pillows and mattresses are super comfy. But if you book a room, prepare to be asked a week before your trip if you want to upgrade to an even better room for $20 more a night (appx.). Could be worth it, but I was so sick of their inconsistencies when I booked, that the last thing I wanted to do was to give them more of my cash."
"My wife and I just spent 3 nights here. It was partially business / partially a tacked-on vacation day. The hotel itself is in a very nice, historic art deco building...The Carbon and Carbide Building. It's at a good location on Michigan and Wacker, right near the river. It's an incredibly easy walk to the Magnificent Mile, very close to Millenium Park (You can be at Cloud Gate in less than 10 minutes), close to the ""theater district"", etc. When you walk into the lobby, you are greated by fairly loud rock music throughout. I like rock, but I have to admit, when I got off the elevator at 7am and stepped into loud Pat Benetar, it was a bit abrupt. We stayed in a Tower room...I highly recommend the slight upgrade. The views are spectacular. The room itself was of modest size. We had two queen beds. The bathroom is a shower only, but it was a large shower, at least. The beds were comfortable. I also appreciated that the window had both a blackout curtain and translucent blinds that pulled down...so if you didn't want to be plunged into complete darkness just to get privacy, you could do it. We never used the blackouts, but enjoyed the city lights coming through the blinds...and in the morning, gentle sunlight.We got good service at the concierge desk and the front desk (and bell desk) were friendly and helpful. Just the right balance of friendly without being overbearing. The staff is fairly young, but they were well trained and did a good job.My only complaint was with housekeeping. The first day there, I had some conference calls, so couldn't let housekeeping come up until early afternoon. When I returned to the room in the evening, the beds were made and the towels on the floor picked up. But the towels were not replaced, nor was the nearly used up soap. The next day, we got a few new towels, but never got any new shampoo, soap, etc. One day, they forgot a new floormat. They didn't give us new plastic bags for the ice bucket. Very little straightening of the room occured. I'm not a very needy traveler, and I never complained...but I wasn't entirely satisfied.Other than this, we did enjoy ourselves, and on balance, I'd stay here again. It's expensive, but it was still less than many of the nearby hotels, and I thought the historic nature of the building was also an added bonus...as my wife and I are art and architecture afficionados.


Room Tip: We got ""free wifi"" because we booked online. Otherwise, it's like $13.50 per day.

"Your money can be better spent at another Chicago Inner Loop hotel. I've been to Chicago Inner Loop for business several times and have stayed at several other hotels. This trip, all other hotels were booked and Hard Rock was the only available hotel. So the poor service started by the kid at front desk at check-in. He was very inexperienced and after traveling from across country, all you want to do is get your key, have some questions answered and get to your room. Not only was it difficult to hear him due to the loud music blasting at the front office from the bar (which is to be expected since, after all, this is the Hard Rock), but he insisted on practically whispering. There are no bellboys to help with luggage. And the room, although large and roomy, had a bathroom where the tiles were practically coming off the floor, the makeup mirror was falling off the wall, and the whole vanity was loose and moveable along with the plumbing. The building is very old, and the place is just unimpressive. But what's funny is that three AM's in a row I tried going to the hotel restaurant at 7 AM before heading out and each time waited to be sat. Although there were two people each AM eating, there was no sign of a host or a waiter. Each AM I gave it a 2 to 3 minute chance waiting there but each time I eventually left. When I ordered room service one night due to a late night working, the food came up in a timely fashion, but the meal plate was not covered. So, who knows who breathed on it, sneezed on it, or what may have gotten onto it on its way up the elevator. Pretty ghetto as far as I'm concerned. And as for price? Very similar to the other places I've stayed around town. The crowd that stays at this hotel is pretty rude, too. Definitely not geared to a business clientele as each night there were people partying and yelling thru the halls of my floor. And as for the gym downstairs, don't believe the smoke and mirrors of their website picture. The gym is very small and not impressive, either. You're better off getting a pass to LA Fitness a block away or LifeFitness that is 2 blocks away (that also has a basketball court). And as for wifi in the room? Don't bother paying for your iPhone. The wifi is not compatible to iPhones and although I paid a fortune to have my laptop and iPhone connected, I had to keep turning off the wifi on my iPhone because it was just not working. In any event, your money is better spent elsewhere. Hope this helps..."
"I wanted to surprise a friend for his birthday and booked a suite at the Hard Rock Hotel Chicago. It was the first time either of us stated at the hotel.LOCATION: The hotel is ideally situated on Michigan Avenue between all the big shopping, The Loop, and many ""L"" stations and bus stops. It's super easy to get around from the Hard Rock.CHECK-IN: I have been traveling for more than 45 years and I have NEVER had a check-in so quick as the one at the Hard Rock. Literally, less than two minutes at the desk and we were on our way to the room. When we arrived at approximately 3:45 pm, there was no line at the desk. Thirty minutes later as we were on our way out to enjoy the city, I noticed a line had begun to form, though. It did appear that everyone was being processed quickly. THE ROOM: I elected to upgrade us to a Tower Suite. Booking through the Hard Rock Chicago's website can give you the opportunity to take advantage of discounts and upgrades that booking on third-party websites does not. When we got to the room, I was a little disappointed. The room seemed almost devoid of decor and the furnishings were rather worn. The carpets had seen better days and should be replaced. There was a light grey sectional sofa in the room that looked like it was ordered from an office furniture and it had a number of unfortunate stains on it. The room had a pool table, which is sort of cool; but, it, too, had seen better days. The bathroom was huge and had really nice fixtures including a shower the size of which could host a catered party. However, the linens were very low quality. My friend said the bed was very comfortable (since there was only a king bed in the room and seeing as it was his birthday, he got the bed and I slept on the couch). THE VIEW: Our room was on the 15th floor and faced south with a fantastic view from the living room and the bathroom (there was a gigantic picture window over the soaker bathtub). Had I not been so tired from a day of travel and walking through Chicago, I would have probably stayed up into the wee hours just watching out the windows.VALUE: The room for one night was a little more than $300 -- easily more than I've ever paid for a room for a personal trip. Even being a suite, I'm not sure I felt like we got as much bang for the buck as I would have thought. I felt like we were in a big, blank room. The suites come with free Wi-Fi in the room, which was a bonus.ODDITY: The odd thing I found disappointing was a lack of music at the Hard Rock Hotel. The room had one standard iPod dock in the bedroom and no other music at all in the room. I figured we'd have some sort of in-room music channels, etc. The decor was bland and definitely didn't give you a ""living like a rock star"" feel. SUMMARY: Aside from stained, worn furnishings and cheap linens, there was nothing really wrong with the Hard Rock Hotel Chicago. But there wasn't anything overwhelmingly right with it, either. If I got an outstanding deal on a room, I'd probably consider staying there again, but it will not be my first choice of properties in Chicago."
"We had a wonderful stay here. It was certainly everything the Hard Rock is known for, from the decor, the music, and style. The staff was very friendly as well as helpful. Upon checking in I arrived to find, much to my chagrin, that my room upgrade was not available. However, I was forewarned that given the time of year and multiple conventions going on that weekend, I would have a slim chance of availability. We were however offered a better room on a lower level just not a tower room. The room was a Platinum King room located on the 3rd floor with a street view and was enormous! My only complaints are that the lighting in the room was very dark, our toilet ran, the furniture was a bit disheveled, and that the wifi charge was expensive. Overall it was a great experience. The location was perfect! We were 2 blocks from the Chicago River and 2 blocks from Millenium Park and Cloud Gate (aka The Bean). We were also in walking distance to Soldier Field where we saw a Chicago Bears game. So many restaurants and shops surrounded us and cab rides for places outside of the area only ran about $6 to Navy Pier, etc. I will definitely stay here again and this time try to stay in one of their tower rooms.

"Fantastic hotel in what I think is the heart of chicago. 5 minute walk to Millenium Park and the Magnificent Mile. The staff were very friendly and helpful and even upgraded us to a better room as it was our honeymoon! The view was fantastic, the room had everything we needed and the beds were extremely comfortable so we slept really well. Being a huge rock fan I spent ages looking at the different memorabeilia and thoroughly enjoyed my experience there. If I'm lucky enough to stay in Chicago again the Hard Rock hotel would definitely be my first choice."
"From the poor service with in-room dining who never answered the phone, made mistakes on your food and who's service was just less than mediocre - no thank you. The rooms werent particularly clean and the bathrooms were so small that the bathroom door hit the toilet and the door was wilted with chipped paint due to the shower. Overall, there are alot of other hotels for the same price that you could go to. I was really hoping for a cool fun hotel, but this isnt it."
"The hotel was expensive to stay at but given the location I guess this is expected. It is centrally located and easy to get to all nearby attractions. The rooms were cleaned daily to a high standard and we had an excellent view from the 37th floor.The downsides to this hotel was that the staff were quite abrupt and quite unwilling to assist if you have a question and also being a Hard Rock Hotel I was expecting it to be more themed much like the Hard Rock Cafes are. We had a picture of Billy Idol in our room and that's about as far as the Rock theme went.The lobby and bar area was just a standard. If you didn't know you were in a Hard Rock Hotel you never would have guessed from the inside. WiFi was expensive which was disappointing given other local hotels were offering it for free. To sum up it was a pleasant place to stay but I probably wouldn't go back.


Room Tip: Ask for a room as high as possible. The views are amazing.

"We booked this for the location rather than for the Hard Rock experience. The hotel is in a great building but rooms are a bit style over function. I say rooms as our first room overlooked the building work going on at the back, but here it was the air condition outlet noise which caused us to ask to change rooms. With this the staff were really helpful and our second room, also overlooking the building work was a lot quieter.Both rooms could have done with a deep clean and a revamp as they were showing clear sights of wear and tear, laminate chipped off of drawers and coffee stains on walls. Nothing really horrible and as we got a good deal we weren't complaining.Bed comfy and good bed side reading lamps. So an OK hotel in a good position, but not the best. You pay for wi fi in room but it is available free in lobby, just make sure that you sit in the area closest to the front windows, or you will repeatedly lose connection.


Room Tip: Avoid the 17th floor rooms at back. The 14th had far less A/C noise. You pay for wi fi in room but i...

"Staying at the Hard Rock this week, the first room we received had a visibly dirty toilet. Called was given the option of changing rooms and we did. However the 2nd room not much better. Bathroom toilet was clean but there was coffee/soda (I hope) splattered on the wall in the bathroom that looked like it would wipe clean if someone attempted to clean it. I am not impressed with this hotel and will not likely return.


Room Tip: Choose a different hotel in the area.

"The hotel was right where we wanted to be, so that played a big roll in our choosing it. We had stayed at other Hard Rocks and had great experiences so that helped in deciding. The staff was friendly and the room was huge and clean, which helps when traveling with 2 teenage girls. Housekeeping did a tremendous job- again because 2 teenagers are not the neatest of creatures. Would definitely stay here again."
"I go back to Fats Domino and Elvis. Music brings the generations together just as baseball has been credited with doing here in America. No better place than the Hard Rock where floors are dedicated to rock stars and music is always playing in the lobby. The club was rocking as well. The staff was terrific. We were given an upgrade, the concierge helped with local travel and bags were stowed after a late check out. We always had the feeling that the staff would do whatever they could forus. The room was on a high floor which was delightful and most importantly, clean, roomy and well stocked with morning coffee, towels and extra drinks and snacks (at a cost).I try to keep a lid on hotel prices but with this hotel, in the center of everything, there is great value; the hotel is close to the station coming from the airport/other city lines. The Art Institute is down the street as was the Cloud Gate sculpture that you must see. Also,the well knownboat tours leave from the closest point to the river from the hotel.It is all there for you. Get to know your children, grandchildren, mothers and fathers, aunts and uncles, even your brothers and sisters by starting with ""so who is your favorite artist""? That artist may just have floor 33 dedicated to him - Bono!

"great location and fast elevators. ping pong table. beds were very comfortable. The room was like an aging rock star, well passed it's prime. The laminate was coming off the dresser/desk. A large picture was missing, the hanging brackets were there. The bathroom sink was wobbly and the faucet spun around loosely. The phone wasn't plugged in and the power cord was missing. I went to the front desk twice to get the room fixed and nothing happened. I feel I was misled by your website and priceline. fool me once...."
"This hotel is in a perfect position for the Mag Mile, parks etc. the staff are wonderful, the cleaner who does our room is great, really appreciate her doing her job as she does.The cafe attached to the hotel is good for breakfast with good service and not that expensive.This is a very modern hotel so don't expect anything old fashioned, it is very clean lines everywhere and the carpet in the hallway is a graphic display of a sound wave. It's strange only being able to use lifts on 1 side but you soon get used to that.The bed is very comfortable,The hotel is comfortable, central and not noisy, all you could ask for in a city centre hotel.We had expected the Hard Rock Cafe to be at the same place but it wasn't hard to find."
"I really do like this hotel, great locatoin and the staff is VERY helpful and nice!The biggest drawback as many others have stated is the convenient items inthe room and fridge. There was not even room for our water bottles or ANY leftovers because it was stocked with their paid for items that if you moved were charged to the rooms. This is not a great place for familes, or people traveling who would like to use a refriderator at any time on a trip.It is a nice hotel and great location."
"I went for a bachelorette party weekend with gal pals. We got a discount on a suite and double queen room. First appearance was great. The staff is awesome. The problem is the hotel upkeep. If we were paying the full price for the rooms I definitely would've thrown a tantrum. There was one day where it was non-stop rain and our ceiling was leaking. It wasn't a light drip either, at times it was as if someone left a faucet on and running on low. I called the front desk about it at like 7am. Three hours later still no one showed. One of the other girls called. About 45 minutes after that an ""engineer"" showed up with an old paint bucket to catch the remaining rain water. He apologized and stated that it's been a busy morning because he's had to deal with that all over the hotel.... Really?! There's something seriously wrong here...Overall, I wouldn't spend the money there again. Oh, and to park a vehicle there is ridiculously expensive."
"Arrived here looking forward to a centrally located nice hotel. Check in was quick and easy, and when we arrived in our room, it was small, dark and with very limited wardrobe, drawer space. In fact, one of the cupboards was screwed closed.We were staying for 10 days and felt really disappointed. We asked the reception if they could provide a room with better storage and they moved us immediately to a large, spacious room with more storage. Well done Hard Rock Hotel! Rooms/bathrooms are serviced daily and are very clean and modern. Beds and pillows are very comfortable.The location is great, staff friendly and the bar/ restaurant is very good and reasonably priced. The gym is pretty good with both machines and free weights and it is open 24/7. Just be careful over the wifi as it costs $13.50 per day (unless you book direct with the hotel) and it will charge again for the 3rd device added to the room. We were paying $27 per day for the first few days and thought we would check. They refunded the extra and we only used 2 devices from then on. All in all a great hotel and I would recommend. I'm still here now and enjoying the facilities.

"This ultra sheik hotel is inside the art-deco former Carbide & Carbon Building and on Michigan Ave. The rooms are large and well appointed and the first two nights we were in a room with 2 double beds. The hotel needed our room for another reservation that required two double beds so we were upgraded to a 1,000 + sq ft suite on the 28th floor that had windows facing N,S, & E. We could see up and down the magnificent mile and see Lake Michigan. Parking is nearly nonexistent and expensive in downtown. The daily valet rate is $60 with in and out privileges. Room service is expensive -- eat in the hotel's restaurant it's cheaper and mostly the same as the room service menu plus some. Mind you that wireless internet is charged daily per device $12 each -- but we argued and was only charged a flat rate of $12 per room per day. Concierge, front desk staff, valets, and bell hops are very professional, knowledgeable, and friendly. Over all a very good experience and in a great location.

"I barely ever review a hotel while still at the hotel. But since I'm nearing check out (20/06/2014) I guess I can make an exception. This hotel was a complete wash out. I arrived during a rain storm, hoping that the doorman/valet would be there to greet me and help me with my luggage. I was elated to see the valet, doorman, and several guys standing there. But neither moved or showed any interest in me whatsoever. I struggled to pull out the heaviest case; no reaction, pulled the other case, no interest, got both cases into the lobby, finally a stir. Someone asked if I needed help. I said no. I wasn't about to give anyone a tip for work that I had already done. When I settled into my room, I couldn't get internet, the TV to switch on, or the phones to work. No apologies, let's make it up to you...'NADA'. Next day same problems with internet. Should I go further? To be perfectly honest, this hotel should have received one star if it hadn't been for a few housekeeping staff that were so sweet that they made me smile. I think this hotel, for what they charge need a few lessons on how to manage a hotel and how to keep visiting customers happy. And this is to the door staff, ""guys, when you see a woman struggling with luggage, help them!!"" Would I recommend this hotel? Are you kidding! The Holiday Inn would probably have been better."
"First time staying here. We chose Hard Rock because of the rock vibe in the rooms. While we did get amazing views and gorgeous rooms, ours were nothing like what was advertised. Pretty sure this applied only to 34th floor because the other floors looked right. We had floor to ceiling dark wood paneling, not a hint of a rock star anywhere minus a funky chair. When the elevator opened on the other floors, you were met with musician pop art, our floor opened to an antique Victorian-era settee. I would have chosen these rooms for myself but we were trying to impress two 16-year-olds so we were incredibly disappointed that they didn't get the Hard Rock experience we paid for -- not that they cared much after checking out their view. Staff was awesome, especially the concierge. Toiletry bottles attractive but impossible to dispense. Only one robe per room and ours had a rip in the logo. At night, there's an awesome vibe in the lobby. It is not near the Hard Rock Cafe but great location."
"We booked this hotel as it was the best value on line and we booked direct and got even a better deal. We did not realize how great the location was until we arrived. The hotel room was clean and a view down North Michigan Ave topped it off.If you need something see Sheila at the concierge desk.Don't want to use a taxi to get around, then this hotel is your hotel. Close to everything one needs."
"The Hard Rock Hotel is in a great location in walking distance of many Chicago attractions including the Merchandise Mart. The rooms are comfortable, stylish, and have great views of the city (King City View). Hotel and bar staff are welcoming, friendly and provide excellent service. They play a great mix of contemporary and alternative rock music in the common areas, and offer live music several nights a week in the bar. The hotel is pricey, but it is a good value for Chicago. A fun thing about the hotel, each floor is themed after a different rock star, we stayed on the Jimi Hendrixx floor this past visit."
"Stayed here for 2 nights while on business. Great location- I liked that there was a Walgreens and lots of restaurants within walking distance. The lobby/ hotel bar/ restaurant had a fun atmosphere. Live bands every night. Very upbeat feel. Got a free upgrade to a city view room. It was great! The room was very spacious...had kind of an apartment feel to it. Beds were SUPER comfortable. Very pleased. Not 5-star, but a solid 4. Would definitely stay again."
"I had high hopes after a tremendous stay last time. This visit turned out to be much more average. Maybe I was spoiled last time with a nice king room that overlooked Michigan Avenue. This time I was stuck in the back of the hotel with no view and a very average room. The room had the feeling of being a bit thread bare. There was a constant draft blowing through that made it virtually impossible to get the room temperature comfortable. The bathroom floor was not especially clean. The bed was comfortable. I ordered room service and it was very prompt but the burger was pretty average. Staff is always helpful and eager to please. Love the location and will definitely stay there again. I will just ask for a room facing Michigan Avenue.


Room Tip: Ask for a room facing Michigan Avenue as high as possible.

Wife and I spent 3 nights at The Hard Rock hotel in Chicago and had a wonderful stay. Our room was a corner room on the 9th floor and we had an amazing view from our room. The restaurant in the hotel CHUCKS food was very good and the service was as well. The city of Chicago was very clean. You did have a few panhandlers asking for money but living not far from NYC it didn't bother us at all.The RED line train was just a few blocks away and took us back and forth to where we wanted to go (Wrigley Field).Nearby restaurants that we chose to eat at were very good as well. We had deep dish pizza at Giordano's and dinner one night at Pizano's one night which was excellent. Did not eat at Morton's Steakhouse but it's right next door to the hotel. We loved our stay and will definitely go back one day and next time bring the kids as there is a lot to do with the kids in Chicago.
"The hard rock hotel is a fantastic place to stay. The building is beautiful standing out from the Chicago skyline with gold against green. The inside is very hip and cool. Every floor has a rock star theme. The service was very good, and the staff were helpful and accommodating. We were able to valet till 3-4pm the next day. This allowed us to see more of the city! Amazing time and would love to go back!"
"When we arrived to our room, it was disgustingly hot. We immediately turned down the thermostat. After a while, the room had not cooled down, so we called the front desk. We were told to turn off the fan and the room should cool down. Approximately two hours later, it was hotter than when we arrived. We again called he front desk. They said they would send a maintenence engineer up immediately. When he arrived, he said that the A/C in the whole building was not working. He couldn't fix it, but he could help us open the windows. I had friends in from out of town. I wanted to show them a great experience, but this was far from it. I don't consider sweating my make-up off while getting ready to go out on the town a great experience... Or being up all night because of road noise... Or listening to the party in the room next door to us, until I called security at four a.m."
"My Fiance and I have stay in Chicago at least a dozen times. We travel every year for a hockey tournament in March. This is our third year staying at the Hard Rock and every year I wish they would book someplace else. Location: Cons* I find that the location is too far south for me. I prefer to be a little further north on Michigan Ave.* Also at night there isn't much open, this arear seems to be close to the financial district and therefore restaurants are not open very late here. It's only a few extra blocks to get to where the action so it's not a big issue. Proits still on Michigan Avenue, shopping and dinning is all within walking distanceRooms: Cons* The walls are VERY thin - we heard everything from our neighbours! Even the washroom which is not what I want to hear first thing in the morning. * The beds are very uncomfortable - both my finance and I have a sore back everytime we leave. Pros* The rooms are fairly spacious for Chicago.* Rooms have always been clean, well maintained as well. Service:Cons* NonePros* Very friendly all around, from the valet parking, front desk, conceirge, security, room service, maids, even the maintnance staff.Overall it's not a bad hotel, however given the selection in Chicago you can definately find something better for your money."
"We had a groupon for a few nights here which cut the costs down considerably. The rooms themselves are nice and have a cool musical touch. We lucked out on the room view (overlooking Michigan Ave). The building itself is beautiful - both inside and out. I wish our room had a bathtub (standing shower only) but even that was pretty nice too. One thing I hated was the minibar/fridge with the attached sign ""motion sensing"". If you take something off, you're automatically charged for it (a pretty common practice). The fridge however had no room whatsoever for your own drinks (completely stocked with pricey beer/beverages) so we had to rely on the ice bucket. You'd think WI-FI would be an included convenience in this day and age (and is in most places I've stayed at) but unless you book directly through the hotel, internet access will set you back $15 per 24 hours...per device! If another groupon came up and we're in Chicago - I'd stay here again...but may be pickier about the room I get."
"My husband and I make a habit of visiting Chicago regularly (Go, Cubs!) and I was led to try the Talbott Hotel based on great service-focused reviews. Despite having an already high impression, we were thrilled to see the Talbott exceed our expectations!! By far, the friendliest and most helpful staff I've experienced, worldwide. When they found out our visit was to celebrate my husband's milestone birthday, they upgraded our room (free of charge) and then sent up a thoughtful note and small box of delicious truffles to help him celebrate! Not at all necessary, but a beautiful example of how eager this Hotel is to go the extra mile and give everyone a special and memorable stay. Beautiful decor reminds me of growing-up overseas and everything was nicely updated and very clean. I also appreciated the surplus of towels and pillows already provided in the room. The location also cannot be beat - 2 blocks off Michigan Ave with all the best shops less then 5min walking distance. We will return to Chicago and are excited to stay again at the Talbott Hotel in the future. We've already recommended to all our friends and family!"
"The Talbott Hotel is a true gem. Could not ask for a better location and having a wonderful restaurant attached worked great for breakfast and drinks at the bar. The staff was friendly and professional...very genuine and caring. Everyone from the concierges to the doormen were so helpful and went the extra mile. The rooms were beautiful and elegant and I loved having two sinks in the bathroom. There were a couple of nice chairs to sit on and a mini bar that we did not use but the prices were actually reasonable. This will be the Chicago hotel I will stay at going forward.


Room Tip: we were on floor 6...a little dark with buildings close by...might be brighter on a higher floor, no...

"If you like a great location, warm friendly staff, and comfortable rooms, you will love the Talbot like we do. We always stay in a suite which gives us an enormous beautiful bathroom, bedroom and large sitting area. There are some small rooms with small bathrooms so if that is a problem for you just note that when you reserve your room. We are within walking distance of some of the best restaurants in Chicago, and fabulous shopping! Whenever we return after being gone for the day, everyone greets us. The concierge is extremely helpful and knowledgeable. We love the Talbot."
"The Talbott has for years been one of our favorite hotels and the location is perfect for us. It's always clean, comfortable, and very quiet. However, the past couple of stays have lacked a bit in late night room service (re: kitchen). During the most recent visit some items were forgotten at delivery, though the kitchen did make good on it. The note, chocolates, and room category upgrade were very much appreciated for my birthday weekend. This hotel has very friendly & helpful staff, especially the doormen and concierge.


Room Tip: Street-view rooms in this hotel typically allow for more light.

"I stayed here for four nights on business. This is a great hotel. A+ and 10 out of 10 on all levels:Welcoming and friendly staff. Cannot stress how pleasant and accommodating the staff all were. Great rooms with overflowing amenities (Molten Brown toiletries, Keurig, Apple TV, etc.)The towels are amazing - seriously. Room service was great. Food was handled by Mercadito the restaurant attached. It is a Mexican restaurant. Guacamole was incredibleReally a top-notch place hidden on Delaware Street near the John Hancock bldg. Not pretentious like some of the bigger-name brand hotels and not so hip I felt old walking in (i.e. no club music pumping on the speakers). And no nickel and diming customers here (free wifi, no ""resort"" fee, coffee in room, and great concierge)Great location too. Two blocks from the Red Line subway. Took that in from O'Hare and door to door was 45 minutes (and $5).I will definitely stay here again when I return to Chicago. This is a well run property on top of its game."
We have just returned from a two night stay at Talbott. what a great hotel! It is very well located and the staff are super friendly. We had booked a king room which wasn't ready when we arrived. Once the manager realized that the room won't be ready by 3 he upgraded us to a 1 bedroom suite instead of asking us to wait. Really enjoyed our stay and wouldn't hesitate to book our next stay in Chicago with them.
"Just returned from a three night stay at the Talbott Hotel in Chicago where we meet up with long time friends from California just to enjoy the city. We had a fabulous time and it all started with the perfect accommodations and service we experienced at the Talbott. We arrived in Chicago at 9:00 AM after an overnight train ride from New Orleans (trains are not what they used to be) and with little sleep from the night before you can imagine our relief and delight at check-in to find our room available. I had called a day ahead to inquire if it might be possible to check-in early and they said they would try and sure enough they did, off to a terrific start. We had a quiet room on the 14th floor (1408) at the back of the hotel and it was perfect, large, well furnished with two great arm chairs, excellent full sized desk, desk chair and keyboard which connected to an Apple Mini and the large flat screen TV on the wall. Free Wi-Fi which was easily connected. The bathroom was large, double sinks, my wife was very impressed with the brand of shampoo, conditioner, bath gel and the Terry Cloth Bathrobes. There was an easy to use in the wall safe at eye level, why don't all hotels do that? My wife's only comment was that the towels were too large (bath sheets) isn't that a little like being too rich or too skinny? Needless to say we were very impressed with our accommodations particularly at the price point.This hotel accepts dogs and I must admit that before staying here I had my concerns, maybe the rooms would smell or be worn but neither was the case. Other than riding the elevator with some very unique canines I would not have known there were any dogs in the hotel. It gave the hotel a European flair that was kind of fun. I would be remiss if I did not also mention how polite and helpful the front desk staff was during our entire stay. Room service was prompt and friendly. The major kudos go the Concierge staff, all three that we meet and made our Chicago experience one we will long remember and have assured we will return. Roana, Gene and Tim delivered expert advice and made every reservation requested, dispensed perfect directions and helped fully coordinate our three days.We did not eat in the hotel so I can't comment on the food but the bar looked cozy and active with a young attractive set that filled it every night. There was a wonderful French like cafe two doors down called Le Pain Quotidien where we had an excellent breakfast each day. The staff pointed out a wonderful grocery store half a block away where you could get any basics you needed and then some (Lindt Chocolate) . Gibbon's Steak House was two blocks away, Hancock Center and The Water Tower Mall were three blocks away and the Miracle Mile of Michigan Ave. was two blocks away, you get the idea, perfect location. Can't wait for a return visit to the Talbott and Chicago, we loved every minute. (I don't hold the Bears against them, they can't help it if they are not Saints)"
"We arrived very early on our 30th anniversary day, about 9am and they let us check in early and they upgraded our room as well. The crew at the front desk was professional and very friendly. The location is great because its walking distance from so many great things in downtown. Dwayne, ""the"" bellman was fantastic with his help and just a great gentleman. Class people, class hotel; you will not be disappointed with your stay at this fine establishment!!!"
"This is the second time we have stayed at the Talbott Hotel in Chicago and I am sure we will stay there again on our next stay in Chicago. From the first phone call to make a reservation it was a positive experience. We got a good price by calling the hotel direct. We arrived in the morning thinking we would just leave our bags, but they had a room ready for us. We had requested a street view, we got it. The first room we were shown had a perfumed air freshener smell and we were prepared to open the window to air it out, but before we knew it the bellman had arranged another room for us without the air freshener smell, very much appreciated because we both have allergy problems. The room has excellent temperature controls, and a very comfortable bed, so we slept very well. The bathroom, closet, furniture arrangement is all thoughtfully arranged for a comfortable stay. We travel a lot and this is one of the best hotels we have ever stayed in. They have a concierge to help with sightseeing and buses which we used on our last visit but did not need this time. It is just an excellent hotel. We recommend it highly."
"Stayed at the hotel for a week, for a business trip and I couldn't be any happier. The hotel location is great, just a few minutes away from the magnificent miles. The staff was extremely friendly and helpful, rooms were large and comfortable. The complimentary wi-fi deserves a special mention: it was the fastest wi-fi ever seen in a hotel, way faster than the majority of home internet connections. If you need a strong and reliable wi-fi for a business trip, in addition to a great hotel and service, this is the place."
"There is a very good reason why the Talbott hotel keeps getting excellent reviews. A high quality hotel with a wonderful personalized service. I called the day before my arrival to see about upgrade possibilities and was able to upgrade to the one-bedroom suite for a very interesting price. This room is wonderful with a living room, great working area, luxurious bathroom and separate bedroom. Everything you can expect from a top hotel, you can expect at the Talbott; robes & slippers, nice large towels, quality products from Molton Brown, impeccable turn-down service with a good size chocolate on your bed, a good quality mattress, complimentary wifi and a great restaurant. The highlight of my day was spoiling myself with a breakfast at the Mercadito restaurant. Delicious food, great setting and wonderful service. My only regret was that I did not have the chance to sample their cocktails in the evening. The location is fantastic close to Michigan avenue's shops and around the corner from all the restaurants you can imagine. Anywhere I needed to get to was no more than a 10 minute taxi ride away and when you come back you will be greeted outside the hotel with the smile and warmth from the bellboys that you will experience throughout your stay at the Talbott."
"With a small but very efficient lobby, furnished in a traditional style, this hotel is enhanced by the most welcoming staff from the moment one arrives.Our room was generous, with traditional furniture that had all the technology that make it an up to date facility.The front desk staff, the concierge and the doormen are forthcoming and aim to help and please, a wind of fresh air that is not seen frequently today.The location of the hotel is very good, close to restaurants and shopping. Rooms are quiet and our bed was most comfortable.A commendable hotel."
"I've stayed at the Talbott twice in the last year. Both times were fantastic. The hotel staff is the friendliest in the city, the rooms are gorgeous and clean, and the location is perfect. I've been very impressed with how advanced the technology is in the rooms while still keeping the traditional old world charm of the building. I really can't say a single negative word about this hotel. I'd highly recommend the Talbott for romantic getaways or business travel."
"From our welcome at valet parking to the entire staff, this is a top drawer hotel. We have stayed at numerous Chicago hotels and have decided this is now home base. This is a historic/boutique property, so there are no Tarmac-sized rooms, but the rooms are beautifully appointed and there has been no oversight of amenities. We are grateful to the Historic Hotels of America for alerting us to this jewel!"
"Stayed at the Talbott House for our very first trip to Chicago. Found a great price for it and the location was excellent. Our king sized bed was very comfortable and the housekeeping outstanding. At the front desk, Brian Smith greeted us warmly and sincerely each time we left/returned. He made us feel like friends, not guests, and I hope he gets recognized for his wonderful demeanor.I have already recommended to a friend this wonderful establishment."
"I was curious about what make tripsadvisors reviewrs give this hotel 5 stars, so we found a very nice package that included wifii and breakfast for an excellent price, so we booked here for a stay of four nights.Since arriving the staff at the front desk were really nice an friendly and the check in was really fast an without complication, they gave us our breakfast tickets an explain us the hours of the restaurant.We went to the 13 floor to a really nice, clean and big room with a nice decoration, and although we didn't have a view to the street the view was not so bad as we saw part of another building and the courtyard I think of the Waldorf Astoria. The room as mention has a coffee machine and decent ceramic mugs to drink you coffee. Also the bathroom toiletries were really nice and the bath towels were really big and white, also exploring the different buttons on the wall we found that you can heat the bathroom in order that it is not so cold when you take your bath or shower.Also what I found really interesting was the little ball with the artichoke that look really nice, and unfortunately as we were not spending lot of time I could not use the vase that was on the nightstand table, but I think it is a nice detail if you want to bring some flowers to your room.It is located really near from the Mag MIle and two block from the nearest red metro station.The hours of buffet breakfast are from 6:30 in the morning until I think 10:00, and the selection of food was really limited as there were scramble eggs, bacon, sausages, fruit macedonia, and chilaquiles, and that was it. I think there should be another option for people like me that does not like eggs and didn't want to eat a lot of carbs, maybe a little bit of yogurt for the fruit. You could order orange or grapefruit juice and coffee or tea. Also when you asked for a toast they gave exactly that one toast.What is really nice about the hotel is the people that works on it, that are really nice, friendly and helpful. The day that we were checking out it took us about five minutes to check out and be on board of the taxi that would take us to the airport.On our next stay on Chicago I will gladly stay again in this hotel."
I took my daughter to Chicago for a small get away. We stayed at the Talbott based on reviews I had read and the price. We were very happy with our stay. The location was great and the staff extremely friendly. I'm one of those people that does not really enjoy hotels - primarily for sanitary paranoia & I am completely freaked out at even the thought of bed bugs! Our room seemed very clean and I felt comfortable (at least as much as I can). I will definitely stay again!
"We a family of 3 adults have travelled to USA 4 times in last 8 yrs from Australia have just spent 4 nights at The Talbot and can honestly say this is the cleanest, friendliest hotel we have ever stayed in.The doorman, concierge, waiters and reception stafff always have a smile and nothing is too much trouble for them. Location is perfect and cleanliness is exceptional. If I had to give a negative it would be to have more selection one on buffet men, there is only scrambled egg, bacons, sausage and hash but being a vegetarian my that left egg and hash for more me, by adding mushrooms, tomatoes and baked beans to breakfast buffet I would give a perfect 10/10 for this hidden gem ****"
"This is the best hotel experience I have ever had. The front door staff (Charles and Dwayne)welcomed us on day one and every time we returned to the building. Tim in concierge took such good care of us and our girls on the American Girl package. Front desk took care of every need that we had. Rooms are spacious with a sitting area and table. It really felt like a second home to us.


Room Tip: Ecofriendly and near Michigan Ave.

"My friend and I recently stayed at the Talbott for a girls' weekend with our young 7 year old daughters. We selected the full American Girl package and it proved to be beyond our expectations. Chef Concierge, Roana B, was extremely helpful and we were absolutely delighted with all the extra special personalized services and care that was put into making our stay special for us and our daughters. Without giving away the surprises, I highly recommend The Talbott for the American Girl experience. You will be creating memories to last a lifetime. The location is ideal to Michigan Avenue and the city is easy to navigate with plenty of dining options nearby, including a Starbucks and Le Pain Quotodien on the same block. For the AG store, make call ahead and reserve a personal shopper (we loved Tracy), it's an invaluable free service that makes sure you give your child the best store experience."
We recently stayed at The Talbott for the weekend of our daughter's Chicago wedding. Our group included immediate family from both sides of the wedding party. We can not say enough about the warm caring service of the entire Talbott staff. So friendly and helpful. Genuinely interested in and happy about the wedding. Their kindness added to the beauty of the weekend. We have to mention especially sales manager Jenny Fiala who set everything up for us and doorman-exemplar Dwayne who was like a loving helpful father to us all. I was not surprised when I heard that The Talbott is a family owned hotel. We felt like they were part of our family. The Talbott a beautiful boutique hotel that makes you happy to be staying with them. Thank you to all. We will be back!
"A wonderful 3 night stay. We were a group of 8 including 3 senior citizens . The hotel wasImmaculate, accomodating , the beds were super comfy and the staff is top notch. The location was convenient to amazing dining, shopping and places of worship(it was Palm Sunday). Dwayne at the bell stand is very knowledgable and gave excellent recommendations. Truly a beauty of a boutique hotel. Service at breakfast was a bit slow and uneven--something to keep in mind if you are on a schedule. Beautiful fireplaces in hotel provide a great way to warm up and enjoy a drink. This was not our first visit and will not be our last.

"The hotel is within max. 5 minutes walk of red line subway however the main places of interest of the city are easily reached on foot. The hotel room also was fabulous with Jacuzzi bath large sitting area - only downside is as with most hotels the lighting is poor but bathroom is fine with plenty light. The breakfast which was included in my room price as a special was good, staff friendly & helpful. A plus was the free membership of the gym & spa at Bloomfields shopping Mall.Top marks from me."
"Faultless stay in this lovely hotel at an exceptionally good price. The location in Chicago simply couldnt be better - a close walk to everything we wanted to visit. Two minutes to the Magnificent Mile, John Hancock Building, Water Tower etc, ten mins walk to the lakefront and ten mins walk to the river and Michigan Avenue Bridge. Wonderful room - huge, fantastically comfortable bed, great bathroom, Frette linen, Molten Brown toiletries, coffee machine and mini bar in room, loads of storage, nightly turn down and pillow chocolate service. The hotel foyer is small but special with leather Chesterfield sofas and roaring fires. But the most wonderful thing about this hotel is the impeccable, but warm and friendly service. We were greeted by name like old friends every time we came and left and special mention must go to the excellent Brian on Reception, and Bellmen Duane, Charles and Gary who always took the time to ask genuinely about our day, or give us advice and directions. Gene, the concuerge was also very lovely and helpful. In fact you couldn't fault a member of staff here - they really go the extra mile to make you feel welcome and relaxed. Whatever they are getting paid it should be more as they really make this place stand our! I was going to book the Four Seasons or The Langham and I'm so glad I didn't - this place is an absolute gem and deserves every one of its reviews on here. If its your first visit to this wonderful city do go up the Hancock building - we went to the Signature lounge in the daytime and night and both times the view was breathtaking. Another must do is to take the architectural boat tour - we got on at Navy Pier - I never could have imagined it would be so interesting and awe inspiring. I can't wait to return to this city and this hotel again."
"We stayed here 4 nights during a recent conference and found it exactly as described in other reviews. Staff is warm and professional, the location is great for metro access as well as many restaurants and shops. Easy walk to the lake. It's a charming ""small"" place that immediately feels welcoming. Our room was very comfortable and clean. The breakfast buffet that came complimentary with our room was fresh and good, but it did not change during the time we stayed. More variety would have made it that much better. We definitely would come back here again!"
"This was a stop on our road trip to look at colleges for my little sister! This hotel surpassed the cost that we had to pay! It was luxurious, so much so that my mother who has not stayed in luxury hotels felt uncomfortable.Checking-In was smooth and easy. The front desk was friendly and helpful. This was a trip for a family of four with two grown daughters. It was spacious and the location was fabulous.This may be silly but I loved the shampoo, conditioner and soap brand they used. It smelled great and didn't leave you feeling too dry. One thing I did not like, was that to use the gym you needed to walk to the nearby Equinox, which would be fine if it were not so cold. It is nice to have the convenience of a gym in the hotel.

"My friend and I took our 14 year old daughters to Chicago for Spring Break. I searched and searched for a hotel and finally settled on the Talbott due to location, cost and the friendly front desk person when I called information. The Hotel had a special so we booked a double queen at a great price for the 4 nights we were staying. A week prior to our visit I got a call from the Hotel asking if we wanted a complimentary upgrade to a one bedroom suite. We jumped at the chance, more space, bigger bath area, etc.The night before we travelled (by train) a family emergency occurred which resulted in us having to take my friends 12 year old along. When we arrived at the Talbott and informed the desk we had an additional party, they jumped right into action and had a rollaway in our suite practically before we got up stairs. They brought up a refrigerator, additional towels and pillows and simply made our arrival smooth as silk.Throughout our stay we were treated with great care and genuine friendliness. The desk, housekeeping, the doormen, the concierge all were helpful to a fault. We could not have been treated any better, kids and adults alike.If you are traveling to Chicago, you cannot go wrong at the Talbott Hotel. You are two blocks from Michigan Ave. and the Water Tower. Easy walk to Navy Pier. Easy walk to Lincoln Park. Red line one block away. The L 4 blocks away."
"We decided to come to Chicago with our son and grand-daughter for a long weekend during spring break. This Hotel is fantastic. The staff is wonderful, the Boutique Style of this Hotel built in 1927 is very classic with beautiful mahogany paneled walls and ceilings.The location is great, close to everything you could ask for regarding restaurants, clubs,shopping, and all types of entertainment. Very safe area, with everyone walking to almost all destinations. If you ever have interest in spending some quality time along the Magnificent Mile in downtown Chicago, the Talbot Hotel will not disappoint you. If we come back again, this hotel will be our preferred hotel in the area. Superb...5 Stars in our book."
"Lovely Hotel clean and spacious room well appointed. I also felt safe traveling alone to start. Stayed in the executive king suite very nice size room with an oversized bathroom. The lighting in the bathroom was nice too. There even was a switch to turn on extra heat as needed. The staff was always attentive and friendly.

"We booked this hotel online through a travel site. Loved the reviews we read.Overall this hotel lives up to the hype. It isn't a big hotel. Very cozy though. The staff shines, from the bellmen, concierge, cleaning service and the front desk personnel. Everyone was always very friendly and helpful.Our room came with two free breakfasts each morning of our stay. The food served was fine. Basic scrambled eggs, bacon, link sausage and fresh fruit. Location of the the hotel is great. It is in the Gold Coast area of Chicago. A very short walk to the Hancock Building, Michigan Avenue, Lake Michigan...etc. The hotel has classic styling with some modern touches in the rooms, like the Apple computer that runs the entertainment system, and flat screen TVs.Overall I recommend this hotel and will certainly entertain staying there again in the future."
"Found this hotel online and took a chance on it as a last minute booking... hotel was classic and beautiful (it's apparently pretty expensive so we got a deal finding it last minute). Hotel was centrally located to everything we wanted to see - walking distant to subways - perfect location and very nice staff!

"We decided to splurge for our anniversary and chose this top rated (TA) Chicago hotel. From the very moment we pulled up in front we knew we were at a luxury hotel. I had decided to self park and the friendly bellmen kindly suggested one of the 3 garages within 2 blocked. (Garage was excellent also)The intimate lobby of this hotel felt more like entering a friend's home than a hotel lobby. The desk clerks quickly located our reservation and were most generous in upgrading our room for our special occasion.The deluxe king was beautiful and every detail was well appointed. The marble bath with gold trim was stunning. We had planned to go out for breakfast the next morning but the complimentary hot buffet allowed us to sleep in and further appreciate our excellent accommodations. We will certainly remember the kindness of the friendly, engaging staff. What a delight. Wonderful memories are made in places like this. We hope to return next year. You will not go wrong staying here!!"
I just love the old world setting of the lobby and the rooms. It's also so conveniently located - just 2 blocks away from the Magnificent Mile.Gary's welcome was excellent. He showed us how to run stuff in our room.Housekeeping services the room twice a day.The concierges were helpful in getting us restaurant reservations and helping us find places around the hotel.I will recommend this to friends and will happily stay here again.
"We were bowled over by the welcome at the Talbott. Every member of staff we met went the extra mile to make our stay special.. Add to that welcoming lobby, stylish rooms, comfortable beds, free Wifi and great location and you have the perfect city stay.I'm only sorry that I'm not a regular visitor to Chicago so that I could become a regular but if you are going there I can't recommend it enough."
"I came to Chicago in September for my sisters wedding. I stayed at this hotel, not having ever stayed at an hotel in downtown Chicago. This hotel is very far North. Very close to all the trendy shops, Water Tower, and a lot of fun places to eat. It is not a huge hotel. it is small and quaint and quiet. I loved that about it. The room was perfect, it was clean, the bed was clean, the bathroom clean, excellent. My one complaint, is that I did feel like I was in a Trip Advisor Commercial, because my view was a brick wall. I had to laugh in order not to cry. It was pretty depressing. I asked for another room, but they could not accommodate me. Because of this brick wall, the room was dark. They could not bump up the light bulb in the room, because they could not change it. I needed light, they brought me in 5 lamps, and in order for the light to shine from those lamps, I have to remove the shades. I am not joking that room was dark. I was going to a wedding, I needed light in my room, to make sure everything looked good on me. I was disappointed that they would not move me to another room, but I do understand this is not a big hotel, so they probably did not have another room for me. I get that. They definitely came though with the lamps, and that helped me a lot. There is paid parking at this hotel and that parking facility is very close to the hotel. They gave you a discount on the parking, but it was still expensive. I don't know if I would stay at this hotel again. I would maybe be closer to downtown Chicago. This was more far north than I wanted to be.


Room Tip: Make sure you do not get the room facing the brick wall.

The Talbott is a great hotel in a prime location just a half block off Michigan Avenue. The staff are all so helpful and friendly. Last stay we couldn't reach a favorite restaurant so we called the hotel contregeri who made the reservation for us right away. Our room has always been so nice and clean. They also have a nice bar and restaurant reachable from their lovely foyer area. I highly recommend The Talbott.
"The Talbott hotel is a real gem! Coming in from the December cold to a warm, inviting lobby with its 2 fireplaces was wonderful. Charles the doorman is so friendly with his ever present smile and Arielle at the front desk was friendly and welcoming as well. The hotel has an old world charm with its wood panelling and decor, so if you're looking for modern, this is not your hotel. The rooms are spacious and the beds and bedding are super warm and comfortable. A big plus is how quiet they are. We slept so well and did not hear any noises from the floor at all! The location is incredible, being just blocks away from Michigan Avenue and many other attractions. We even walked to Lincoln Park Zoo, a longer walk but definitely doable. The only negatives are a lack of hair dryer and mini fridge in the room, but those are minor inconveniences. We forgot something in the room and it was mailed to us right away at no charge. We would not hesitate to stay here again, it has a wonderful ambience and was a great experience!"
"I will definitely be staying at the Talbott again next time I am in Chicago. I went last weekend with a friend for a girls weekend away and we could not have asked for a better hotel. The staff was more than friendly. Both Gary and Jerry were helpful and friendly! This is a full service hotel with great attention to detail. You can't beat it for the price! The location is great as well. It's very close to shopping, restaurants and most of what we had planned. The beds are comfortable and the rooms are spacious. We didn't have one complaint. It was a great place to be from beginning to end."
"My boyfriend and I visited Chicago for one night as part of a 12 day US roadtrip. We managed to get the Talbott hotel for a great price through a Black Friday deal and I'm so glad we did.Everyone was friendly, the concierge service so incredibly helpful and the rooms were beautiful and even turned down in the evening with a chocolate on the pillow. The only thing that let down the hotel was the bath tub itself which was a bit outdated but nonetheless impeccably clean.Thanks Talbott we will be back for sure!"
"We always stay at the Talbot and have been for years.The Talbot is a unique experience. It removes you from the hustle and bustle of the big name hotels in the area. It is literally 60 paces from the Sofitel and a few more steps to designer shopping, restaurants etc. To me It is the best location you could have in Chicago. You are a a couple of blocks from Michigan Avenue and great shopping to east. To the north you are a couple of blocks from Lou Malnati's Pizza, the best deep dish in Chicago, or Gibson's Steak House to name a few. The shopping in the area is boutique based with Department stores thrown in the mix down the Miracle Mile. If you are or have a doll collector in the family, American Girl is just a few steps away. Whether you are here in the summer of winter it is a great place. Peaceful, quiet and relaxing. When you walk into the hotel it is an instant calm unlike the hustle and bustle of the loud convention style hotels. The staff is extremely personable. The doormen are polite courteous and respectful and just plain friendly. The atmosphere is a throw back to the elegance offered in premium hotels in past decades. Two Fireplaces flank the entrance and are as inviting as their sitting area is warm. Quality furniture and detail in each and every room. 42"" televisions and in the Suites you have access to a Mac Mini which runs TV and Internet. Regular rooms are well appointed. King Suites include a beautiful Bedroom, Separate TV Lounge/Meeting room with Desk and pull out couch. Bathroom has both a tub and separate shower with his and hers makeup/shaving sink or vanity areas. A feature i really enjoy is the separate heating unit that can be turned on in the very large bathroom to make it more comfortable when getting out of the shower. All totaled I am guessing you have about 800 square feet including the main foyer entrance area. Very comfortable. It has been recently upgraded. I prefer the old decor, but honestly this new decor is equally as nice. The in suite decor is far from dull with room accents and appointments in every room adding the decorators touch and feel to each room. The Beds and pillows are not worn. They are plush, comfortable, clean and always refreshed.Bottom Line Great Hotel, Great Value, Great Location and Great people. Do yourself a favor and stay at the Talbot.

"Loved our two night stay at the Talbott. It's such a luxury to stay in a family-owned place; the quality of service is on a whole other level. The decor is sumptuous without being fussy. Our room was large and comfortable. From bellman, to front desk, to concierge - everyone was great! We walked everywhere - downtown shopping, the Art Institute, the Gold Coast, Lincoln Park. I will try and stay there every time I am in Chicago."
"The Talbott Hotel is a very European experience - - small, well-decorated and maintained public spaces, a genuinely interested and attentive staff, and big, comfortable, and nicely decorated rooms. It is not the Ritz and isn't trying to be. This is a welcoming, low-affect place that instantly feels like ""oh, this is a nice place and I am glad to be here"". It is great for walking to shopping and dining, especially since the hotel restaurant can't seem to get going. That's actually okay, because there are plenty of good places to eat within two blocks in every direction."
"Stayed here two nights ago with my wife for our second anniversary. We are a bit younger and possibly not the hotels main age bracket of clientele but we were still treated very respectfully.The room was gorgeous and we had a nice view facing to front of the building. The room is very modern, but it still retains a cosy homey feel. We got some drinks from the bar that were very well made and delicious. Unfortunately I do have to say that I have a complaint about the hotels restaurant Mercadito Fish. We went for breakfast and I ordered the Spanish omelette and my wife the eggs benedict with salmon. When the food came the hashbrowns we both received were greasy and cold like they had been cooked 30 minutes before and the salmon on my wifes eggs was without a doubt old. We are not really picky eaters but the salmon was nauseating and she sent it back. She got the pork with her eggs instead and unfortunately that came back and was over 50% gristle. On top of the fact that most of the pork was inedible, it too tasted old. My omelette was fine but after sending her breakfast back once already we were just annoyed and wanted to go back to our room. For a 30 dollar breakfast it was annoyingIf the breakfast was anywhere else it would not have been a big deal but for a hotel that is so nice, it took away from the rest of our experience a little bit and left us with a bad taste in our mouth as we checked out.Overall the good outshined the bad and the hotel was beautiful, but I would not recommend the restaurant based on my experience."
"Myself and boyfriend were on holidays in Chicago from Ireland. We spent 5 nights in the Talbott Hotel and I can not fault one thing! The bedrooms are fab - the bed is super comfy, the rooms are huge and clean and they are cleaned daily with a turn down each evening. The hotel staff are so friendly and go out of their to assist in any way. The cost of accommodation was so reasonable considering how amazing the hotel is and for such a central location. It is about a 5 min walk to Michigan Ave - Water Tower end. I still can't get over how reasonable it was! I can't wait to go back! Ten out of Ten!!"
"My wife booked the Talbot for a weekend getaway before Christmas. She toldmewhat it would cost. When I saw the location, I was amazed and didn't expect much. We were there to shop anyway. When we got there I was more amazed and when we got to the room,I said ""this can't be our room,"" but it was. I've paid 2-3 times as much for hotel rooms that were nowhere near as nice. And the staff was great. I can't imagine coming to Chicago and not staying here.

"We've stayed at the Talbott the last several years for a winter weekend getaway to Chicago. The Talbott is a charming, intimate boutique hotel. The experience begins with the doormen, who greet you with a warm smile - Charles always greets us with a friendly ""welcome back."" The bellman are accommodating and prompt - Perry always makes sure our bags are in our room within minutes of our arrival. The desk staff and concierge ensure all your needs are met. The same staff have been at the Talbott over the years we've been coming, a testament to the stability of the management.The rooms are warmly decorated and recently renovated. We've stayed in king room and one-bedroom king suites. We prefer the space of the suite, which has a large bathroom with tub, shower, and two sinks (one with a dressing table). The living room has plenty of space for the large sofa, two stuffed chairs, and a large desk. The Talbott is a short walk from Michigan Avenue and Oak Street shopping, Rush Street restaurants, and many other Chicago amenities. Yet, the Talbott is just off the main streets in a (relatively) quite location.

"The weekend after Christmas, my wife and I stayed at the Hotel Talbott in Chicago. The hotel was clean and elegant, with a great location with a very quick walk of Rush Street and Michigan Avenue, but what really set the hotel apart was the incredible staff. From the moment we were dropped off at the curb, every employee of the hotel was friendly and willing to go beyond what I would consider the call of duty. I mentioned in passing that it was my wife's birthday, and they sent up a card and a box of truffles thanking us for spending the special occasion with them. I do not have a single complaint about the hotel, and I do not hesitate to give it my strongest recommendation."
"For our long weekend trip to Chicago, I was hoping to find a hotel that I wouldn't have to pay $300-$400/night and would be close enough to walk to most of the sights along Michigan Ave. We had a great stay at The Talbott. The staff was very friendly and helpful, the location was perfect, and the rooms were just right for our needs. We spend very little time in our rooms when we travel, so it is just a matter of a good jumping-off point and comfortable accommodations. We were traveling with our nearly-adult children, so I booked two rooms (a king and double queen), and they conveniently located us around the corner from each other. I had seen so many review comments about Dwayne, and now I see why. Gave us great ideas on places to eat for breakfast and lunch. The location is 2 blocks from the John Hancock Building and 360 Chicago, and is perfect for Michigan Ave. shopping. You won't go wrong by staying here. Highly recommended.

"My wife and I stayed at the Talbot the weekend of 12/26/14-12/18/14. Overall, it was a positive experience. The doorman quickly helped my wife out of our cab and had our luggage on a cart before I paid the driver. He welcomed us with a warm, enthusiastic greeting and ushered us to the front desk. We arrived appx. two hours before check in but this was not a problem at all. This was when things interesting.  The bellhop took our luggage from the doorman and said he would be happy to take our things to our room once check in was complete. We had reserved a standard king room and decided against the $60 per night upgrade that was offered to us. We were handed our room keys and told where our room was by the very friendly and efficient receptionist but the bellhop had vanished. Not spending for the upgrade so not worthy of bellhop service? I picked up our luggage from the cart and headed up to our room. When we opened the room we decided that the upgrade would be worth it. The room was small and the view was of a wall and fire escapes of the property next door. We called down to the front desk and requested the upgrade after all which was handled easily and our new room keys were waiting for us by the time we reached the lobby. So to was the previously elusive bellhop. Hmmm. Everyone else at the Talbott was wonderful. The front desk people always said hello when we were coming or going and the doorman was quick to hale a cab or assist with directions if we were walking. We did not eat in the restaurant, but I did have coffee there this morning and again I was met with warm greetings. The lobby has rich wood decor and two fireplaces surrounded by furniture that beckon you to sit, relax, and enjoy the space.  The Talbott is closely surrounded by taller building so if you want a room with a view, this would be a poor choice. The rooms are quiet though and kept very clean by an attentive housekeeping staff.


Room Tip: if you want anything other than a view of a fire escape, request a room that faces south or onto Del...

"Needed a break from our routine, so we took the kids (14 & 17) for an overnight stay in downtown Chicago. Used Trip Advisor to aide in hotel selection and as usual we were not disappointed! The Talbott was warm and cozy. The staff was friendly and welcoming. Dwayne was particularly charming and helpful. Very clean, quiet, and comfortable. Easy access to tons of shops and restaurants. Able to park a block away for $41.00 after validation from the hotel (parking not my favorite part of visiting downtown Chicago as we spent over $100.00 for parking over 2 days between the Shedd, Navy Pier, and the hotel). We would definitely stay there again next time!"
"The Talbott is home away from home. From the minute you walk in there is an inviting atmosphere that makes you feel like you never want to leave. The hotel was decorated for be Christmas holidays, with two fireplaces. The fireplaces and lounge area around them were great to warm up with a glass of wine. The staff is superb, very accommodating. They were able to accommodate my very early check in. Gene the concierge was excellent, was extremely nice and had great suggestions on places to go.The hotel has an old worlds charm, loved all the wood finishes and the vintage decor. The rooms are cozy, and very comfortable. They have Apple TV and also control the in room computer. I found this very helpful. The Keurig machine was an added plus, very easy to use and convenient. Overall a great experience and great hotel. Can't wait to come back. Definitely my home away from home when I visit Chicago."
"My wife and I spent last weekend at the Talbott. We could not have been more pleased. The location is close to everything on the Gold Coast. What really sets the Talbott apart is the welcoming atmosphere provided to guests. Gene the concierge was the best and the front desk (Rebecca) was always prompt and courteous.Everyone, including the maids, greets you with big smiles and are so welcoming. Being the Christmas season, the lobby seating by 2 fireplaces was tastefully decorated and was a welcome spot to rest with a drink after hiking the Michigan Mile The room was quiet and comfortable. . We hope to return as soon as we can! I promise you will love your stay here. Scott and Becky Webb Indianapolis, In"
"I'm giving the Talbott a Super A+ This review is to give you information you might need. The other reviews can do the raving. I would only be contributing to the current array if I did the same.The Talbott is located on one of the most prestigious streets in the Gold Coast. It's only a few doors down from the Four Seasons and literally across the street from the Waldorf Astoria. There is no better place to stay. It's one block from the John Hancock building and the 4th Presbyterian Church (their 4PM Jazz Service is recommended). Very, very safe. There is a restaurant attached to the hotel as well as a very nice bar. The bartender poured my Crown's stiff. I tipped stiff. Soon, I was then not stiff. The lobby has gas fireplaces where I enjoyed coffee and the paper every morning. Quite comfortable and intimate. Very classy decor. Guests will be impressed. The TV in our room had an Apple MacMini attached to it (aluminum body with CD slot) so you can surf the net on the TV while you kick back on the awesome comfortable bed. The shower had great pressure and stayed hot every minute, every day. The bathroom was super clean and had an illuminated magnifying mirror on an articulating arm, hairdryer, toiletries, everything. Ours had two sinks which we found to be very helpful when getting ready for dinner, or to go out. The linens on the bed and in the bath are top notch and super clean. Luxurious is the descriptive word best used. Room service personnel are the nicest we've ever known. The rooms are kept clean (as is the entire hotel) and they turn the beds for you and leave chocolate. Mmmmm, chocolate.The bathrooms have fans in them! Even the Four Seasons' we've stayed in don't have fans in them. I don't know why so few do. Personal time doesn't need to be community time, you know?The valet are gentlemen. Their execution of duty is superb. Sorry Ritz, none of your guys have ever helped us like that. It was their manner; the way they made you feel important. True class, each and every one of them. Bravo!Room service was quick and quiet. No fuss, just excellence. Again, Bravo!As for the desk staff, I give them a super A+ too. Every single one acted as if we were the most important guests every minute we were there. I was impressed with them as professionals as they handled everything for us perfectly. We have found through our travels that the front desk is the vital driver of an uncomplicated experience in a hotel. Again, Bravo!Finally, the price. Excuse me, but you're in Chicago. The Gold Coast of Chicago. You WILL pay. But you won't pay a lot at the Talbott! You can go across the street and pay four times as much if you wish. We choose to stay at the Talbott. So, has this review made you realize your search is over? Have you not been convinced? Go ahead, read more reviews of other hotels. Do more research. Waste more of your time or trust me and everyone else: STAY - AT - THE - TALBOTT. Capeche?"
"My night at the Talbott was a gift and a gift I'll take with me for years. Every staff member was exceedingly kind and helpful. I felt like they were the parents, aunts, and uncles I'd see on TV in some glorious imaginary TV land. From Terevius who helped set up the reservation to each doorman, reception person, cleaning person, I felt pampered at every step. The bed was so cozy I passed on breakfast just to enjoy the coziness another hour. I rarely visit Chicago, but the opportunity to stay another night at the Talbott almost has me booking another trip, just to stay in the Talbott Hotel!

"My family and I recently stayed at the Talbott over the Thanksgiving holiday. The rooms are spacious, clean and well appointed. The staff are very helpful both with responding to requests such as asking for a small refrigerator for the room or getting a bathroom repair. They are also very helpful around getting around Chicago and giving suggestions to make the stay more fun and comfortable. I would stay there again in a heartbeat. The location can't be beat!"
"My husband and I visit Chicago several times a year. this past weekend was our first experience with the Talbott hotel, and I'm thrilled to say we've found our ""go-to"" hotel.The staff are incredible. They clearly love their jobs, and it shows through exceptional service. The cosy old world charm is lovely and particularly magic at this time of the year. The rooms are spacious and comfortable, the room service very good, and little touches like an entertainment system which allows you to play your own movies and music are terrific.From Gary at the front door, to Bryan at the desk, the awesome location, and Pizanos around the corner, the whole experience was exceptional.

"We ended up booking this trip 5 days in advance because we were not sure we were going. Found it online and when I saw the price it was too good to pass up so I thought I would just take my chances. All knew was that the location was pretty good. Well that was an understatement. Location was amazing. Two blocks from metra station, steps from great shopping in every direction, around the corner from Michigan avenue and the Water Tower. Lobby was warm and inviting. We only ate at the restaurant for breakfast because we were heading to Evanston for the day but it was quick and good. Service was excellent. Room was plush and well appointed. Loved checking out the Apple TV. Bathroom was on the small size but it is Chicago so I don't think it mattered. No great view out the window but for the cost and everything else The Talbott had to offer who cares? Greatest accidental find ever. Next time I head to Chicago I am checking back in at The Talbott."
"The Talbot is right off Michigan Ave in chicago along the Magnificant mile.

"This hotel is much more personal and intimate than the typical big city hotel. The ambiance is fantastic. The desk staff greets you when you arrive ""home,"" and it has a warm and friendly feeling. The quality of the rooms and the service were outstanding. I was here on business, but I was sorry my spouse wasn't with me to share the excellent experience. The location is fantastic, steps from Michigan Avenue shopping and surrounded by quality restaurants in close proximity. It was such a nice experience that I want to go back with my spouse for a vacation! I tried the onsite restaurant for breakfast and I wasn't disappointed. I will definitely stay here again as my first choice in Chicago the next time."
"I had an extra day on a business trip, so selected The Talbott based on other great Tripadvisor reviews. In addition, compared to other downtown hotels, The Talbott was more affordable. I drove to the hotel, which was an interesting experience in itself. Thank goodness for great directions on my iPhone! At the entrance, Dwayne explained that valet parking is $58, or self-parking is about $10 less. So I self-parked, which wasn't too difficult. The hotel was luxurious, my room was extremely comfy, and the staff was so helpful and friendly. I had a marvelous time walking around town. Was very close to shopping, food, and the trolley tour, which I enjoyed the next morning. Took a taxi to Navy Pier and rode the Ferris wheel, even though it was very cold. (November) I had a great 24 hrs in Chicago, mostly due to the hotel's great location and super-comfy-ness. Can't wait to bring my family here so we can enjoy all the museums and other touristy stuff. I would definitely love to stay at The Talbott again! By the way, be sure to enjoy Garrett's Popcorn at the Water Tower or Navy Pier. Amazingly yummy!

"If you want to get away from the vast conference hotels in Chicago then The Talbott is for you, a small boutique hotel with classic charm and a personal touch. Rooms are large with comfortable beds, great linen and a substantial bathroom with free standing shower and a tub, albeit small. Our only disappointment was the changes made to the bar which has lost its uniqueness, gone is the oldie worldie warm personal feel that lends itself to this hotel, having said that it won't stop is returning. The Talbott is perfectly situated, minutes from the Magnificent Mile, Hancock Tower, Frog, Gibsons, The Backroom and an array of other great restaurants, bars and attractions. We look forward to our next visit.


Room Tip: High floor and go for an executive.

We just left this faboulous hotel after a 4 days stay. This was the first time for us and we truly enjoyed it! Location is fantastic.The bed is super comfortable and the room ( we had a deluxe king) was big and super clean.The staff was super helpful and nice to speak with. A special mention has to go to Dwayne ( I hope that the spelling is correct) and Tim the Chef Concierge ( whenever you see a golden key you know you are in the right place).Thank you again for your welcoming we really felt like at home and we hope to come back one day in the future.THANK YOUTommaso & Sonia
"Very nice hotel located near everything you would want to do. Room was very clean and spacious for a downtown hotel. The staff was very friendly and accommodating. The bar was a good place to catch up with business friends, the bar staff had a great sense humor and mixed some fantastic drinks. I would advise trying to get a room on one of the top floors, its hard to get a great view in a town of skyscrapers all around. I stayed on the 11th floor not much of a view but it was very quiet. There are several place around hotel to eat and shop."
"Thank you Tripadvisor travelers for sharing this outstanding hotel selection! With so many positive, glowing reviews we were prepared to be a bit disappointed. To the contrary, The Talbott exceeded and surpassed all our expectations! From the moment we arrived, we were warmly greeted, checked in without delay after our flight and led into a tastefully appointed room on a low floor as requested. We loved the Apple TV which welcomed us by name when we powered up, along with the super-comfy bed and pillows. The Talbott has thought of everything you might need (or have forgotten) from the magnified wall mirror in the bathroom (had I known I wouldn't have brought mine!), extra supply Frette towels, qtips & cotton balls and the golf size umbrella in the closet if needed. Loved the Molton Brown toiletries and the Keurig single serve coffee machine. Let me not forget the outstanding and professional staff who are eager to assist in any way they can. Ideal location near shopping, sights & restaurants. Simply LOVED LOVED LOVED this hotel and will definitely be back!"
"We decided to give this hotel a try after reading the reviews on tripadvisor. We were in Chicago for my husbands 50th birthday and this hotel was perfect for us. Personal service is given at every turn. The personnel know your names and are constantly looking to exceed your expectations. This hotel does is right. It has a great location, close to museums, shopping, tours, restaurants, and walking along the lake. We are looking forward to returning to the Talbott. Thanks for a great time!"
"We chose this hotel based on reviews here. We were not disappointed in the least. Dwayne greeted us at the door like we were long lost friends. He made our stay exceptional and is the only doorman I have ever hugged in my life! He is the heart of this hotel. Rebecca and Zi at the front desk were super sweet and we kind enough to upgrade us to a suite. Everyone who works here loves their jobs you can tell by their attitude and demeanor. The room was huge, clean and quite. The maids do a great job. The towels are the biggest I have ever seen and are replaced in some cases twice a day. The turn down service is nice, who doesn't love chocolate before bed. We had two climate controls for the main room and bedroom and both worked very well. This hotel is just outstanding in every way. Stay here and Dwayne will make your stay the best ever!"
"stayed here for 2 nights this week, and was impressed with the hotel, the staff, rooms are large, big flat screen, juccuzi tubs, room safe, in-room complimentary imac computers, desk and comfy exec chair. The hotel has no restaurant but there are a ton of wonderful places to dine with a bloclk or two radius. One suggestion to the hotel would be to change out the seating in the launge, they have to be the most uncomfortable stools I have ever sat on. You need something in button and leather with high backs, and a proper brass foot rail to match the hotel. It will pay for itself in nom time as guests will hand around to drinl. Recommended."
"Typically when I go to large cities, I tend to stay in large chain hotels with a proven recommendation. When we went to Chicago, I took a gamble and went with a Tripadvisor recommendation to stay at the Talbott. I was leery, but we got a great deal on it, and the location was perfect. Man am I happy that I made this decision. I've traveled to over 150 cities in 14 countries, and I think this is my favorite hotel. When you walk into the lobby, you are immediately greeted by at least two people who could not seem happier that you were there. I can't describe the smell, but they pipe in some air freshener that just puts you immediately at ease. From a basket of fresh fruit daily on the front desk to DVR access in the rooms, the Talbott has really thought of everything to make your stay perfect. For being in the middle of the city, the noise level was shockingly low, and the area felt very safe. My entire stay felt like it was tailored specifically to me, and I would go back in a heartbeat. I know that I have focused a lot on the physical attributes of the Talbott, but the staff really did make the experience as good as it was. They remembered us by name when we came in and out, and there was nothing they couldn't help with.

"I consult Tripadvisor often but have lately been lax in posting. But the Talbott was such a fantastic hotel experience that I'm compelled to add another rave to the many already on the site. Upgraded on arrival from a standard king to a spacious suite for our 3-night stay, everyone and everything at this hotel was top-notch. Great attention to customer service, luxuriously comfortable and quiet lodgings, good location. Would recommend to anyone and will definitely return."
"My husband and I stayed here during a working weekend and even though we didn't have a lot of time we thoroughly enjoyed our stay. From the moment we pulled up to the minute we left everyone was so helpful, from the doorman to the housekeeping staff. We had a lovely quiet room and the recommendation to a great cafe was spot on. We would recommend this hotel for anyone who wanted to be in the city but also truly enjoys some peace and quiet after a long day."
"Well, maybe NOT so hidden- a GREAT location on Delaware- close to EVERYTHING and about a block away from a beautiful little park! We enjoy the boutique hotel concept and the Talbot did not disappoint. For a weekend rate of $325/night- not bad for Chicago. The staff is really personable and helpful. Elevators were QUICK and while there was NO VIEW on the 14th floor, the rooms were comfortable with mini bars and decent in-room coffee. Room service very prompt. At 11pm when we returned to our room- we wanted to indulge in some late night TV and found it not to be ""working"". Front desk sent up an engineer immediately who found a broken cable. It was replaced quickly and we were in business! Intimate bar that can be really quiet or ALIVE with young adult banter. Bartender and his staff work like a well greased machine, but very friendly and very interesting and HELPFUL! A wonderful experience all the way around!!!"
"Stayed at the Talbot for a week early October and delighted with our choice. High quality accomodations with luxury fittings. The beds were the most comfortable we'd ever slept on and the linens top-quality. The towels were uber-soft, plush and in plentiful supply. Every evening when the maid came in to turn-down the bed, she replaced any used towels so that we had fresh towels twice a day- a first in my experience.  The room was spacious and traditionally decorated and the bathroom was spacious with two basins and the deepest bathtub ever! Generous Molton Brown toiletries were replenished daily. We were given daily $15 vouchers towards our breakfast in the restaurant downstairs - large selection of pastries, juice, fruit, eggs, bacon etc. served at table and the voucher usually covered the entire cost. On arrival Dwayne gave us the low-down on the locale with useful hints on a nearby supermarket where we could get our juice, water etc. He also told us that we could empty the minibar/fridge to make space for our own supplies and once we put all back as it was there would be no charge for this. The air conditioning worked perfectly and as it was quite warm while we were there we appreciated this. The Hotel is ideally situated close to the Magnificent Mile and Old Town. The Bar and Foyer area are pleasant, again traditionally decorated and a nice spot to pause and scan the complimentary newspapers.We had pots of hot water brought to our room to make our own tea with our own teabags (irish) and were not charged for this service, again much appreciated. We had a very spacious double room with two five-foot canopied beds, a desk area, armchair and a huge flatscreen tv. There was free Wi-Fi in the room. There was lots of storage and coffee-making facilities. There was a secure safe, an iron and ironing board and a very good hairdryer. We could not have asked for more and The Talbot Hotel will be our first choice when next visiting Chicago. Highly recommend.

"In town on a business trip for 3 nights. The staff were incredibly helpful and polite. The obliged my request for a corner room on a higher floor. I stayed in 1207 which was a very nice and large room. It had a sitting area and large king bed. The bathroom was very well appointed too. The hotel is smaller which made getting in and out so easy. There is a nice bar attached to the lobby. The location is awesome. Three blocks from Michigan Ave. shopping and you pass the Rush St. restaurant district with Gibson's etc. Although this was a business trip I will be bringing my wife back here soon. Thanks to the fine staff at the Talbott!

"During our weekend at The Talbot we found the hotel to be inadequate and out of date. It has no service elevator so after waiting 5 minutes for an elevator to come, it was filled with housekeeping staff and a cart filled with garbage bags. On another occasion we shared the elevator with housekeeping staff and a cart filled with glasses and coffee cups. The housekeeping staff was slow and sloppy. On our first day we returned to find a pile of dirty towels on the floor of our bathroom, below the fresh ones that replaced them. On the next day we did not return to the hotel until 5 pm and found that our room had not been serviced and there was no housekeeping staff in sight. The front desk staff was very pleasant, but to check out they do not put a bill under your door or offer an electronic option. You have to go to the front desk which means there is a very long line on Sunday morning when everyone is trying to leave. The hotel's location is great, but we wouldn't stay there again because for that price there are many other options that would be much better."
"Stayed for 5 nights at this wonderful hotel - our 25th Wedding anniversary trip that had been 6 months in the planning including a stay at The Talbott. Fantastic staff, great location within easy reach of all of the shops and restaurants.

The location is perfect, the staff is delightful, the atmosphere is lovely and inviting, and the rooms are great. We were treated kindly throughout our stay, and we enjoyed the attached restaurant for a drink as well as breakfast. Both were perfect. I am so glad that we found this spot, and I look forward to returning again soon!"
"After being referred and reading the reviews my friends and I knew this was the place we had to stay for our girls trip. We were greeted with smiles outside while arriving to the hotel and at the front desk. Our rooms were ready and Perry showed us to our room with our luggage. He explained every detail about everything in our room and even made recommendations on where to eat and shop. He was great!The rooms are space-ish and so are the bathrooms. We loved the double sinks and hairdryer. If you are staying at this hotel the following are in walking distance for your convenience: Tempo, Tavern on Rush, Gibsons and Mich Ave.The reviews are true! This place was absolutely fabulous and worth the stay."

I really enjoyed a grand stay at the Talbot hotel. I was extremely pleased even though it was an all expense paid trip through my profession. The location is great in the heart of what appears to be their downtown district. It has easy access throughout the city with its public transportation close by. It has a reasonably priced bar and restaurant on premises which are both great staff wise and menu. it's obviously an upscale hotel so don't expect cheap pricing. That's why I did say reasonable. The staff seemed to be real great especially Dominique.
"We stayed at The Talbott for a long weekend just to get away. It was one of the highlights of the trip. The service was something that we really appreciated. The front desk staff was cheerful and helpful and a delight to speak with. The room was spacious and comfortable and well appointed. They provide an apple computer with a wireless keyboard which we found to be very convenient when planning our visit.The location is great. Shopping, dining, drinking and sightseeing are a short walk away. We walked to Navy Pier to watch the fireworks on Saturday night.Great place to stay, you won't be disappointed."
"We chose the Talbott Hotel for our recent trip to Chicago based on other TripAdvisor reviews, and we could not have been happier with our choice.The hotel is close to Michigan Avenue and the Red Line trains. We walked or took the train for our entire stay, with the exception of taking a taxi to/from Union Station.The entire hotel staff was very friendly and helpful. We used the concierge service multiple times and received great restaurant recommendations.Our room was spacious and clean. The two things that stood out for my husband and I were 1.) the shower head was high on the wall so that the water wasn't hitting my husband in the chest. You would be amazed at how many hotels have shower heads very low and 2.) the towels were large enough to wrap around yourself and tuck in the end. None of those short little towels that barely cover anything!!The hotel also has free Wi-Fi, which I guess is not common in Chicago. They also have an Apple tv and keyboard, so you don't technically need to bring a computer to stay in touch. They also have an electronic notification system for housekeeping to let them know if you don't need room service for the day, and a ""smart"" thermostat.Overall, our stay was fabulous and I would stay at the Talbott again."
"This hotel is just wonderful - very friendly and helpful staff from the moment you arrive. I can't recommend it highly enough! The room was fantastic - lovely and spacious and a beautiful bathroom. First time in Chicago and we booked through Expedia in the UK. It was great value for money as I would expect to pay much more for a hotel of this quality. Apart from the staff and the rooms, one of the best things about the hotel is the location - easy to get to the L on State Street, close to Michigan Avenue and there are lots of places to eat and drink around the area. Believe every good review you read about this place because it really is the best!"
"We found The Talbott after eating breakfast at Bice in previous years and decided to try it this trip to Chicago. The hotel staff was friendly. Parry was especially helpful. The hotel is clean and quiet. The rooms are up to date, spacious and very clean! The big negative was the view out our window was a wall of a building, which is disappointing when staying in downtown Chicago. Our room was next to the elevator and we never heard a sound, which helped us get a decent sleep each night."
"So much good has been already written about this wonderful hotel, I am tempted to only say amen to all the 5 star reviews. Everything about the Talbott is outstanding, but the staff is the one area that stands out above the rest -- they are exceptional. Everyone we came in contact with was friendly, helpful and kind. It is apparent they like their work and they appreciate their customers. The hotel location, A+; the cleanliness and attractiveness of the rooms, A+ and the rate per night, a great deal compared to other high end properties in Chicago. A special mention about the gentlemen at the Concierge desk -- simply top notch. Well done Talbott!!


Room Tip: We loved our Parlor King. Spacious and elegantly appointed.

"We visited Chicago for the first time for our anniversary and stayed at the Talbott on the recommendation of a friend for three nights. What a find! This is truly a fantastic boutique hotel situated in the Magnificent Mile area which offers excellent sightseeing, shopping and walking tours. The staff was friendly and accommodating, the concierge service first class, Mercadito restaurant dining very good, the rooms clean and well appointed and the location perfect.We will stay at the Talbott on our next trip to Chicago and will definitely recommend it to our friends."
"I took my goddaughter (14 yrs old) to Chicago for one of our city tours we choose each year as we explore great cities in the US. The Talbott met all my expectations and more. The rooms were larger than most you will find. We had a double queen room that was spacious and well appointment with WiFi on the television so we didn't even have to pull out our computer. The bed was just right with lovely comfortable bedding and pillows that were not too soft and just enough support and dust mite free (not pink eyes in the morning). The location was wonderful with easy access to within walking distance of two major restaurant neighborhoods, weekend outdoor market, an awesome little grocery store and the magnificient mile and the hop on hop off bus. My goddaughter particularly like the near by outdoor gelato and juice bar near Carne's restaurant just 2 blocks away. The staff were very friendly, personable and accomodating. The concierge made all our reservations and even got our boarding passes in the middle of the night and printed and delivered them under our door. We had showers on our last day and though it was wonderful trying several great restaurants in the area, we popped into the seafood restaurant in the hotel and had a very good meal before heading to the airport. Enjoy, eat and relax."
"I picked the Talbott on the basis of the reviews I read here, and we couldn't have been happier. Our room was spacious, nicely appointed and immaculately clean, with very comfortable beds. My daughter and I liked the make-up mirror in the bathroom, and we all appreciated the plush towels and bathrobes. We were on the top floor but we did not have a view. That was not a major concern as we didn't spend a lot of time in the room. The concierge was very helpful in providing advice; we particularly appreciated her tip to visit the top of the nearby John Hancock building rather than stand in line at the Sears Tower. Somehow it came up in our conversation that I'd had a birthday recently, and soon a card and some chocolates were delivered to our room. Each time we entered the hotel the desk staff welcomed us back and asked how our day had been - and they were sincere about it! The location of the hotel is very convenient. We would most definitely stay there again."
"I booked a trip to Chicago for my husband's 40th birthday. I chose the Talbott based on Trip Advisor reviews, and was not disappointed. The staff was lovely, they recognized my husband's birthday with an upgrade to a beautiful suite, a birthday card, and a small gift of chocolates. The front desk staff, bellmen and housekeepers were uniformly kind, friendly and helpful. The room was incredibly clean and comfortable, provided robes were thick and comfy, and the TV even included a linked computer for web browsing. The location was great--only a couple of short blocks to shopping on the Magnificent Mile, the John Hancock Building, and the American Girl Place (if that is your thing). There is also a CTA Red Line stop a few blocks in the other direction. Easy access to the Loop, it is walkable in nice weather.I highly recommend a stay here. My only suggestion is that the hotel improve their website--it was hard to tell what the amenities were from the website only."
"Dwayne and the rest of the team at The Talbott Hotel were fabulous! We traveled to Chicago to celebrate my dad's 60th birthday, and we could have asked for a better place, staff or suggestions from concierge and other staff members. We were walking distance to the metro and fun activities. We received recommendations on great restaurants, blues clubs, and other activities (besides baseball, because we already had tickets to both Chicago teams' games). Thanks so much to the staff at The Talbott, and especially Dwayne!"
"I stayed here for nine nights in July 2014 as part of two months' travelling in the USA. It has to be the best hotel I've ever stayed in. Great location. I walked happily to most places I wanted to visit, feeling safe even at night. Good public transport took me further out of the city. You really don't need a car here.My room (at the back) was quiet and extremely comfortable. Everything worked. The service was up to old world standards for the serious traveller - no do-it-yourself technology here; while the internet, television and office technology were bang up-to-date. My plaudits to all the staff - who seemed to enjoy working here - and especially to the concierge who ensured I missed nothing I would enjoy. I left here to go camping in the deserts of Utah and Arizona, well-prepared and rested before the trek. I wish I could have found somewhere as perfect to recover afterwards.I arranged the stay at a bargain price at the last minute, and felt guilty that I had paid so little for so much."
Had a wonderful stay at the Talbott. The Hotel is charming and the room very well appointed down to the Molton Brown lotions and soaps which were yummy. Everyone was helpful and friendly. The location is perfect for strolling the tree lined streets and looking at Chicago's architecture. I hated to leave. This will be my go to place whenever I am in Chicago.My only suggestion would be more plugs near the bed for charging devices. Can't wait to go back!
"We stayed a full week in Chicago and couldn't have been more happy staying at The Talbott. Our deluxe king suite on the 14th floor was very well appointed; we particularly liked the large flat panel T.V. which included a fully operational Mac computer; this gave us access to anything we wanted on the internet, even our Netflix account! The furniture was a bit dated but the king bed was very comfortable and the bathroom had two sinks with a shaving mirror which my husband really liked! The staff at the front desk and elsewhere were just so friendly and helpful. We didn't eat at the adjoining restaurant but did have some drinks there; the rates were typical Chicago downtown rates...quite expensive. We enjoyed breakfast at the newly opened ""Le Pain Quotidien"" just down the street at the corner of State Street or at the Tempo restaurant just over on the next street on Chestnut. What we enjoyed the most about the Talbot is its location being so central to everything. Close to the magnificent mile, Oak Street Beach and then to the Red ""EL"" line and buses which can lead you to the Chicago River south or to Wriggly Stadium north...We thoroughly enjoyed our stay.


Room Tip: Rooms higher than the 10th floor and at the back of the hotel are quieter. Corner suites are larger...

"For shopping and restaurants you can't beat the location of the Omni. We have stayed her on several occasions and always love it. The staff is extremely accommodating and the suites are great since they offer space over and above a normal hotel room. Beds are big and cushy - lots of pillows. Good black out shades if you want to sleep in. Nice big bathroom. The restaurant (676 - formerly Cielo in the old days) is very convenient and has great service. LOVE the Bar - and it has a fabulous view over Michigan Avenue. A nice touch is when you come in the front door - they always say ""welcome back"" - and honestly, you do feel welcomed.


Room Tip: High Floors, corner suites on the Michigan Avenue side of the building - some have lake view.

"Our room (and I think most of the rooms) had a separate sitting room with a sofa bed. There was a small fridge in the bar area also. They had a heated indoor pool. The bathroom was a little on the small size with a tub/shower combo. Everything was very clean. There also was an area with multiple outlets by the bed that you could recharge your devices.We had breakfast in the dining room and both the service and the food were great. The hotel is located right on Michigan Avenue and you have all the wonderful shops steps from your door. Also, everyone at the hotel was very welcoming.All in all, a very nice and welcoming hotel in a great location"
"The rooms are beautiful. We enjoyed our stay. The location is perfect for shopping and sight-seeing. The meeting rooms for conferences are very nice and the food they provided during the meetings was good. My only issue was booking my stay with a corporate credit card. Even if you take the card with you, they won't let you use it without a form filled out from your institution. Had I known that in advance, I would have had it done. We would stay here again, for sure."
"AH-MAZING! We chose to the Omni to host our family and ourselves for our wedding and the were truly wonderful. I shopped around for reasonable quotes and the Omni was the only hotel that gave us a great rate. We worked with Emily to help us set up everything for the wedding and she was truly wonderful from helping us pass out our hotel bags to last minute details with the wedding. She recommended a great company for transportation and set up a nice itinerary for our guests so that our day would run smoothly. She was extremely accomadating through everything and even left us a wonderful surprise the night of our wedding! We also held a brunch at the 676 restaurant that was absolutely delicious! The rooms were absolutely beautiful, clean, and spacious. The staff were extremely friendly and very accomadating in whatever we needed! Thank you Emily and everyone else at the Omni for making our weekend so special!!!!!! An absolutely wonderful experience!"
"Right on Michigan Avenue & Huron, this Suite Hotel is absolutely fabulous. I requirested a suite on a high floor, and got a corner unit on the 25th floor. The hotel has just been redone again (2nd time in 10 years) and is absolutely beautiful. The service is absolutely incredible, I always get a great rate by calling corporate reservations, and I would simply not stay anywhere else in Chicago but here. Walk the Miracle Mile to your hearts content. When you've shopped until you can carry any more, take it to the hotel, and go back out and go the other direction on Michigan Avenue. Absolutely incredible.

"We had an amazing stay. Not one complaint at all. The minute we got there-early by the way, the valet started out so helpful and friendly, they were our favorite staff to deal with so friendly/helpful w ideas on places to go. The concierge were super friendly right when we walked in my daughter got a bad w coloring activities. Counter staff at check in were super friendly they sent up the housekeeping to get the American Girl stuff set up quickly since we were several hours early. My daughter was super surprised w AG package and loved the cookies & milk at check-in and candy set up when we returned that 1st evening. the Breakfast in morning was amazing.. Organic & fresh foods great chooses and staff so awesome. The pool & fitness area was good. The room was updated and clean-no outside noises to disturb us.. We will definitely pay the lil extra for this amazing hotel when we visit again. Definitely get the breakfast & valet included package it was the best.. If you also join the OMNI club membership for free you get some great perks as well.


Room Tip: we were on the 21st floor so no outside noise and could see the lake from room.

"Cons: 1.asked for a room with a view when making reservations didn't get one was stuck facing a wall.2. Toilet sprung a leak had to have maitnance in the room several times and move rooms at 2am b/c they could fix it3. The room we moved to wasn't as nice as the previous room but had an amazing city view ( was told no rooms with view were available when we checked in)Pros 1. Locatio. Location location!!! Wow talk about a mag mile experience you won't soon forget2. Courteous, professional staff 3. When our toilet broke maitnance came within minutes of calling the front desk 4. Great small pool and gym5. Very large rooms 6. Upgraded recently 7. Amazing breakfast just perfect with beautiful views of the mag mile8. Not only did they move our room when the toilet broke they refunded us 100% without me even knowing they did that and gave us a complimentary breakfast and bottle of wine!! Would return over and over"
"We stayed here for our anniversary, a fact we noted on our reservation in the ""comments"" box. Immediately upon checking in, we were congratulated and given an upgrade to an amazing suite. Later, when we came back from dinner, we found a note saying that we should call a number to get our ""complimentary amenity"". When we called, the in-room dining service brought us a bottle of champagne and a small box of chocolates. This was truly above and beyond. Either of these touches, on their own, would have been more than enough, but putting them together really impressed us. Beyond that, the hotel was beautiful (including a lovely view of Michigan Avenue) and the location is very convenient to everything we wanted to do. The room itself was great, and the bed was very comfortable. Everyone from the staff that we interacted with was very friendly and eager to help, and the overall experience was wonderful! I would definitely recommend to anyone visiting Chicago, and would be happy to stay here again!"
"We stayed at the Omni for one night, it was a perfect location to just about everything you want to do. Staff was very friendly. We got the parking and breakfast package, it was worth every penny.. The breakfast buffet was one of the best I have ever had, friendly staff and wonderful food.. The room was larger than I thought it would be which was very nice.. You will not regret your stay, we will definitely be back.

"This hotel offers outstanding service and comfort to both business and family travelers. There are three lobbies and one needs to transit from the lobby elevator to the tower elevator but after some initial confusion it all becomes clear. Professional staff was attentive and courteous. Room service and amenities were also spot on. The best in shopping was just outside the door on the avenue. I slept like a baby, and I rarely do when on travel.

"My daughter and I utilized the American Girl package offered at Omni Chicago. We had an amazing experience with a wonderful room and friendly and efficient staff! It was truly a magical experience for my daughter! She felt like a princess! And the valet parking, clean room, online check in and express check out made it a stress free stay for mom, too. We can't wait to go back for a longer weekend!"
"We just spent 3 nights at the Omni Chicago and could not have been more pleased with our stay. The hotel is in a perfect location, the staff and service was excellent, our rooms were nice, and the food was very good. We needed a room that was comfortable for our family and five and there were very few options available to us, bu the Omni seemed to fit the bill. Having stayed at other more expensive hotels in Chicago, I was surprised by the price of the Omni. After staying, I would not hesitate to recommend the Omni to anyone, whether traveling with family, for business, or just a couple looking for a getaway. The staff was attentive without being in the way, the food was awesome and the rooms were very, very nice. After reading some the reviews, we were a little concerned about outdated rooms, so I requested a room with an update and was pleased to even see this information in my notes when I received an email confirmation. Our room was updated and perfect for us. We did the parking and breakfast package which was an awesome value considering our family of five received a $30 food voucher per person, per day ($150 total - good for breakfast buffet or room service), and free parking ($67/night) for only $97 more per night. We ate the buffet every morning, including the special Easter buffet, and the food was very good. We also had lunch one afternoon, which was also excellent. I would not hesitate to stay at the Omni again. My only negative is even being on the 18th floor, you do hear a lot of street traffic on Michigan Ave. (sirens, horns, etc.), but this is to be expected in a city on a busy street, so this is certainly not a downfall of the hotel, just something to note if that bothers you!"
"This is a great location, just off of the Magnificent Mile, close to shopping and restaurants within walking distance. Very friendly staff - curb bellhop was extremely helpful in giving directions. Rooms are suite-style, which is nice for multiple guests, with privacy doors for the master sleeping area. It smelled really good as we walked in and the rooms were clean. We checked in a bit early, so my double bed preference was not yet available, so they gave us a king, with a pull-out. The pull-out wasn't overly comfy, but I made my husband sleep on it, while my teenage daughter and I shared the king-size bed, which was very comfortable. Pillows were really comfy! Window ledge was a bit dusty with a few cobwebs, and our view was mostly apartments on Huron St., but overall a nice room. Very quiet in the hotel. Sign up for the Select Privileges, as you get free (non-alcoholic) beverages brought to your room for 2 guests every morning, even at the lowest (gold) level and wifi privileges. The mini bar was not cleaned out when we got there, but the staff took care of it right away. I would stay here again."
"We arrived on a Thursday and were able to check in early. We left on Easter Sunday. Our room was on the 20th floor, with a view of the skyscraper windows next door. The location is excellent - right on the magnificent mile of Michigan Ave, so the shops, Water Tower Place, and the John Hancock are all within easy walking distance. However, parking is valet and $67 per night (plus tip), and sirens and car horns kept us up at night. Bring a fan to reduce noise and help you sleep. We used a fan app on our phone. Starbucks and drugstores are all within walking distance. The area seemed safe and while there were people begging on the corners, police were often stationed in the streets. Maid service was great, and quickly provided the extra items we requested. Turn down service provided milk and cookies for our kids, which was nice. Our room had two double beds and a pull out couch. I would have preferred queen-sized, but that wasn't an option.There is no fan in the bathroom. The only mirrors are also located in the bathroom which made it difficult for the four of us to get ready. It would have been easier had there been a mirror in a bedroom or in the living area, but no such luck. FYI - bring your own hair dryer as the hotel hair dryer was small and a slow performer. The pool and hot tub were small and overcrowded. The pool was only four feet deep. Lots of people with little kids in the hot tub, even late at night. We were traveling with our two teenage boys. They went swimming but we skipped it as there really wasn't any room for us, which was disappointing. We were really looking forward to a hot soak after being on our feet all day.We ate dinner at the hotel restaurant, 676, but it was expensive and more gourmet than for those with little ones. The portions were small and despite paying $185 for four of us, we all left hungry. Side note on the streets - apparently Chicago decides to close certain street access to Lake Shore Drive (LSD) depending on the day of the week. We found out that one can't merge onto LSD from E. Chicago Street during the week, only weekends. Streets aren't always marked, either. Get directions and ask specifically if there are any closures depending on the day..."
"The Omni brand typically stands for quality, luxury, and excellence. This Omni is very outdated, although it is possible they have begun renovations since we were there. Only hotel I have been in the past decade that had an old RCA TV in the bedroom instead of a flat screen. So out of date that nothing showed up properly on the screen because they are formatted for normal TV of our age. Most egregious and unforgivable though was that when we first got to our room, I walked into the bathroom and there was a cigarette butt lying right in the middle of the bathroom floor. Of course that makes you wonder ""what else have they missed?"" staff was barely apologetic, didn't offer to move us to a new room or anything, and when we called the head of house keeping up to explain our concern, he simply shrugged his shoulders and said what do you want me to do?? You just expect so much more from the Omni. With the other quality hotel options on the Mile, there is no reason to stay at a hotel that charges way above the modeling of its rooms and clearly has questionable housekeeping practices."
"My best friend and I decided to take a quick birthday / girls getaway trip to Chicago. Neither one of us has ever been. From the time we entered the hotel the entire staff made us feel welcome. Our room was newly remodeled & very cool! Best thing was the concierge (Mr. Amiri Hayden) - his suggestions on dining, social, shopping, etc. made our trip fabulous. We wanted to ""not think"" on this trip and just enjoy a new city. He basically arranged our entire three days there and everything he suggested was fantastic. He introduced us to a city we now both love and cannot wait to get to see more of. And, trust me, we will be letting Mr. Hayden plan our next trip too! So if you want to have a trip where you can just relax and go with the flow, you are in good hands when you stay at this welcoming hotel - ask for Amiri Hayden and you won't go wrong! (P.S. Their breakfast buffet has the best bacon ever!)

"Our stay over a Saturday night was very pleasant with a few exceptions. Rooms are clean, well maintained, nicely decorated and comfortable. Staff is very friendly and helpful.The hotel is in a great location for sight seeing and restaurants.On the down side, we were place in a room surrounded by families with children so there was a lot of noise both late in the evening and early in the morning. The outside noise from Michigan Avenue is disturbing as ambulances are arriving and leaving the near by hospital all night. Service in the restaurant is a problem.Nice hotel, but beware of some of the pit falls!!!


Room Tip: Rooms not facing Michigan Ave. would be quieter and higher level rooms would be preferable.

"Bedroom facilities on the surface looked clean, modern and its location on Michigan avenue is a plus. But the toiled stank of drains when we arrived, obviously hadn't been flushed and cleaned for a while. But the most terrible thing was that the hot teach/coffee maker myst have and a little but of standing water at the bottom whig had gone moldy/slimy. My husband made the tea (obviously expecting this had been cleaned (he mistake) and then when we drank the tea - I vomited badly 10 minutes later and my husband felt terrible. I was really sick for the rest of the day and as I write this the day after - I still have bad stomach pains. Thanks OMNI Chicago - get some proper cleaning staff - that was disgusting! When I called the front desk upon leaving (they had charged me for wireless without letting me know wireless was extra - watch out for that one - that was refunded) the woman did not call the manager over the fact I had thrown up due to the insanitary condition of the coffee maker and she seemed indifferent. Had i worked there and received a call like that from a customer - I would have been horrified and ensure that the customer realized we identified this as an unacceptable issue. Her reaction made me feel like this happen all the time. Worrying!"
"I'll make this short and sweet. I defy you to find a friendlier staff and better accommodations in Chicago without spending $500/day. You can't - this place was excellent. The staff consistently went out of their way to make me feel like I was the only person in the hotel. The room I was in had just been remodeled in a very tasteful contemporary style. Very clean, very modern, very comfortable."
"I have stayed at the Omni three times now and always for business. I am usually staying for only one night and barely have any time in the room aside from sleeping. This last week I was there for two nights and I had some time during the day to explore the neighborhood a little bit take advantage of some of the other amenities. I personally like Omni because I always have a consistent experience across locations and they are very reasonably priced for the quality compared to other competitors. I love this location because - 1) there is a clean, well-equipped gym, 2) the staff is always super friendly, 3) every room is a suite and 4) it is very centrally located for business and tourism (you have the original Pizzeria Uno/Due within 4 blocks walking distance). For the value, I think it is a great choice instead of a pricier Hilton or boutique chain and I also think the quality is higher than a Marriott or Sheraton.The only reason I did not give this 5 stars was because I went out to dinner on my second night there and when I came back, housekeeping did not shut my door properly after turning down my room. While it was not obvious that the door was open, anyone could have gotten in. That's a problem for me especially in a larger city. Also, I had some receipts laying out that they threw away which I needed for record-keeping purposes. My opinion is, if it's not in the trash, please don't assume it's trash and throw it out! I notified the front desk of this and they were very apologetic and confirmed they would speak to the team to reiterate these things which is all I really wanted to have happen.I will definitely stay here again. Another plus - the bed and pillows are VERY comfortable.

"We stayed at the Omni on a quick weekend trip to Chicago. While the room was a bit on the tiny side it was very well appointed and had an amazing view of Michigan Avenue. We were literally 5 minutes from shopping, dining, and the riverfront. The hotel has a very nice gym and it's claim to fame is a swimming pool on the 14th floor. Originally built as the Medinah Athletic Center this swimming pool is where actor / Olympic athlete Johnny Weismuller trained. (Think Tarzan) This hotel has charm and history to go along with it. I had a mild ""haunting"" experience there and thought that was pretty cool. We ate in the lobby bar and the Michael Jordan Steakhouse which I will review separately. Suffice it to day that many celebrity restaurants don't have a very high quality and rely on their name alone. The Michael Jordan Steakhouse was better than any I have ever visited! From the service, to the food, to the Restaurant Week specials that we enjoyed the place was top notch!! I will select this hotel again without a question.


Room Tip: If you enjoy the hustle and bustle of a busy city then a room facing Michigan Avenue is a MUST!

"We traveled to Chicago for a fun weekend before Christmas to catch a college basketball tournament and to Christmas shop. The Omni Chicago was the perfect choice, as it is located in the heart of Michigan Avenue close to prime shopping, landmarks, and excellent restaurants. Everything was beautifully decorated for Christmas and was within walking distance; we only caught a cab to and from the airport and to the United Center. The best meal we had during our visit was at the hotel's restaurant 676. We arrived late our first night and ordered room service. It was one of the best burgers we've ever had. We also enjoyed the bar our last night and breakfast the morning we left. Excellent quality and service each time. Customer service was top rate, and we loved the doorman. He greeted us with a smile each day, and congratulated us on our team's victory (Go Tar Heels!) when we arrived back from the United Center. Will definitely stay again!"
"I only have lovely things to say about our stay at the OMNI Chicago: Shaun (woman) in reservations started out my experience with FANTASTIC customer service, when I wanted to pre-order a bottle of champagne to be sent to our room she even inquired as to what we were celebrating (so very thoughtful); from EVERY bellman's smiling face; to the courteous and friendly front desk staff who went above and beyond to take care of us and extend our stay twice when our flights were cancelled due to a blizzard; the conscientious housekeeping staff, especially the turn down service maid; to the restaurant staff who were always there to clear a plate but never intrusive (and what a marvelous Sunday brunch - kuddos); we especially LOVED the hot coffee and tea delivered every morning as part of the select guest service - what a nice treat. both of our rooms were simply lovely and the extra space was wonderful. Thank you to everyone who made our trip one of the best excursions ever. It was truly appreciated. I do not usually gush, but seriously... it's justified."
"The customer service at the Omni was top-notch. My issue was with the hotel room itself. I had reviewed online and saw where the Omni had received several good reviews and was considered 4 stars. Based on this, I decided to stay there. The beds were very uncomfortable and the television in the room appeared to be from the 1990's. I had to pay an additional $7.99 for my daughter to watch Disney shows. I would not recommend."
"Our family has stayed at the Omni on many trips to Chicago and prior to the most recent trip, I really had no complaints. The hotel is undergoing some much needed remodeling so I requested one of the ""new"" rooms. The room has new carpet; new lighting; remote control blinds; and finally, the tube television in the bedroom is gone. I did not like the remodel - the new lamp near the couch looms over the person sitting there and is very odd. The remote control blinds are nice but the control panel requires the use of a flashlight to find it. The bedroom seems to be darker. The bathroom is very bright but so was the old one. There is no coffee table and it was replaced by a very small ottoman. The small table under the tv is gone and the refrigeration part of the minibar does not work. All of that aside, the room that connected to ours had small children that started crying continuously, beginning at 4:02 AM, until 7:30. The hotel was not busy so I still wonder why we were placed in that particular room. We were moved to one of the old rooms on the 25th floor. The shade behind the bed was broken and was fixed twice. The HVAC unit only had one temperature (neither hot nor cold) so we had to keep one of the windows cracked. The minibar refrigerator was broken and the first replacement refrigerator was broken but the second one worked fine. The complimentary internet service is spotty and very frustrating to use. Not all was bad, however. My wife ordered room service one night and the food was excellent. The service at the Omni is outstanding and all of our issues were resolved at one point or the other. We will probably stay there again, maybe. The location is the best in Chicago, especially for the Magnificent Mile, and there are many great restaurants nearby."
"We had stayed at this hotel a few years ago and was very pleased to see that it was still receiving favorable reviews. The room rate had an option to include parking which made it a very good deal considering the overnight valet rate was over $60. Hotel was very clean, pool was very nice, and the staff was great. Only issue was that while it was very cold outside, our room was extremely warm. We had to use the A/C all night because it was uncomfortable. Would still stay there again, but the heat was an issue for us."
"When planning a trip across the US, which included a 36 hour train journey from Montana to Chicago, we wanted somewhere to relax and overcome the ""cabin fever""of a long trip. We knew we would be feeling tired and needing serious bathroom time after the journey.In picking the Omni we chose well. Our room was lovely with great views out to the lake. The hotel pool and fitness center were superb and the staff were incredibly helpful. The location just off the Magnicient Mile was perfect for shopping and sightseeing, Highly recommended.


Room Tip: Pick a room facing the lake

"The Omni is a nearly great hotel. The best thing and the worst thing about it is the location. Great in that it is very centrally located on the Magnificent Mile. The worst is that it is a difficult check-in and check-out if you are driving a personal car. The front door is located about 100 feet off of Michigan Avenue on Huron Street. Huron is a one-way street heading West. No way to approach the front door without navigating the Michigan Avenue traffic and then having to deal with the crush of taxis and Ubers trying to pick up and drop off passengers at the Omni. The next hurdle is dealing with the street level lobby and then the third floor front desk. The hotel needs more car valets and more bellman. Checking in on a Saturday afternoon at 3:00 p.m. during the holidays was, to put it mildly, quite stressful. Once we were checked in however our stay went smoothly up to the time we checked out.My family and I had the Presidential Suite on the 25th floor. The Fam included four adults and four children. The rooms were very nicely appointed, spacious, clean and very comfortable. I thought it odd that the master bath did not have a whirlpool tub but that was but a minor inconvenience. The beds were very well appointed and very comfortable. Everyone had trouble signing on to the hotel wifi but we worked that out with the Omni tech people. On the surface the physical structure suggests you are in a four star, solidly built hotel. Well decorated and well appointed. For this Christmas in the City family weekend I normally book a suite at the Palmer House Hilton on the executive level but that hotel was booked. The Omni, on the surface, appeared to compete favorably with the Palmer House, until we went to bed. From 10:00 p.m. through 2:00 a.m. we were kept awake by various doors closing in the hallways, voices from adjoining rooms and party revelers reenacting scenes from the Hotel Paradiso, a favorite Italian comedic farce.On our last day, Sunday, we had the bellman come up and we checked our bags with him. We then checked out and went to the theater. We returned to the Omni to get our vehicles and our bags. One would have thought this process should go fairly smoothly. In fact, it was the worst experience we had while staying at the hotel. It took over an hour to get two cars and our bags and leave the property. It is never good when your last experience at a fine hotel is a negative one."
"This hotel was not a top choice previously when visiting to Chicago, but it will certainly be a future consideration, in large part due to its location. Outside of the annoying way in which you have to enter the hotel, the staff was very helpful and knowledgeable. A room upgrade despite not having previously visited was great. The rooms were decent sized with blackout curtains and the height of our floor kept out noise. The bed was perfect though. For a quick one-night stay, this hotel was perfect, while also offering a very convenient location."
"The staff at this hotel seem very committed to being friendly and helpful. From the doormen to the desk staff and the housekeepers, all our interactions were great. The room was very clean and comfortable. (Maybe we had one of the newly redecorated rooms?) Biggest disappointment: Given how meticulously clean most things were, there were two HUGE glaring failures. 1) Next to our door as we checked in were 2 dirty glasses. During the 3 days we were there, NO ONE moved these. In fact, one day several other dirty dishes were placed there by someone yet still they remained in the same location right next to our door as we checked out. It's disappointing for this to be the welcome to our hotel room. 2) The pool area was atrocious. The pool deck was soaking wet with very large collections of water everywhere. Grime and assorted loose hairs were all over the deck as well. And for some reason, a collection of press-on nails had been removed by some guest and left next to the pool. Perhaps the nails were a new thing when I walked in from some rude guest and maybe they were cleaned up shortly thereafter, so I'll forgive that one, but why was the rest of the pool area so dirty?! If you ignore these two problem areas, the rest of our stay was great! The room was nice to use as a base for exploring Chicago. It is in a great location right in the middle of the Magnificent Mile. Staff were helpful when asked. If you are a Select Guest with Omni (and I don't know why you wouldn't be) you get free internet and free morning beverage delivered to your room, and cookies and juice were dropped off for our children on the first night. All in all, a pretty good experience, but so close to being a step above."
"First the good: The doormen are very helpful and polite. The hotel entrance is clean and modern, and it has a great central location.Now the bad: We were assigned an Accessible room (even though we didn't need one). The floor had a slight skunk smell. There was garbage in the bathroom bin. There was brown bubbly water in the toilet. There was only decaf coffee. There were only cheap foam pillows. The closet door frame was not attached to the wall and the door wouldn't close so I had to force it back into place so I could shut the closet door. As it was an accessible room, there was no room to hang coats in the closet. The carpet was ""bubbling up"" from the floor. The bedroom TV was an old 24"" tube tv with bad picture that can't be fixed since the remotes don't have that option. The mattress was so springy it was almost trampoline-like. The front desk gentleman was chewing gum...I've stayed at almost all of Chicago's higher end hotels and this has been my biggest disappointment so far. Basically, by the end of the trip I felt really bad for anyone who would actually need an accessible room since they would be guaranteed such a substandard experience. Needless to say, I won't be back."
"Check in time was at 3, I was unable to get into my room with my luggage until 5-5:30 missing my New Years eve Dinner, my room charge was $179 and they charged me $371 after I spoke with the desk and made sure on the price and even my invoice reflects the $179 rate and then they authorized a hold of $666 which is still on hold as of 1/6/2015. The staff was not understanding and did not offer me any choices or corrections to these issues."
"Wonderful Anniversary Weekend with the wife. Could not have chosen a better hotel or location. The entire staff was courteous and polite. Room service exceeded our expectations. They left nothing to be desired. Our first stay at an omni hotel and wont be our last. You may have many choices on the magnificent mile but this place will dazzle you. I read several reviews online of people who expect perfection when they themselves are not perfect. Little things happen in life and you smile and move on:-). My magnetic key didn't work twice when we came back to our room. No big deal, I called down and I swear before i got off the phone someone was getting off the elevator with another key! My wife was glad we stayed and would have stayed another night if we had the time. Will definitely return in the summer with kids!!"
"My family needed two suites, and I requested a quiet portion of the hotel, because I need quietness to be able to sleep. We were placed on the 23rd floor, in a section that had not seen renovations yet. When we arrived, I noticed several glasses outside the door, in the hallway. One of our rooms was reserved as an American Girl Two Doll package, but when we arrived, only one doll bed and all of the things that accompany that package was there. I called, and housekeeping brought up the second set of American Girl doll things (a doll bed, doll robe, and other doll-related items). I should not have had to remind them that we paid for the Two Doll package. When the housekeeper left, she didn't notice the dirty glasses that were in the hallway, and still did not remove them. The concierge did take the trouble to deliver some petit fours with my daughter's name written in chocolate on a plate, as a birthday treat, and those were pretty.Overall, I felt that the hotel staff really did make an effort, if they were reminded to do certain things, but I was disappointed with some of the guests, and I suppose also in the failure of hotel security to remain on the 23rd floor. Let me explain:There was a certain group of guests in the room adjacent to one of ours that very frequently yelled amongst themselves in their room, and they were easily heard in our bedroom. They were prone to loud, angry arguments. This group also spoke very loudly in the hallway, even at 10pm, 11pm, and midnight. One of them repeatedly opened and shut her door, about ten times. I poked my head out and asked her if she would like me to call someone to assist her, and she informed me ""I was just checking the lock"". Our neighbors, combined with various groups or individuals who would loudly talk in the hallways, as late as 3:30am, made it very difficult to get to sleep or remain asleep. I didn't call the front desk every time someone was loud, but I did call about five times in one night, especially about our neighbors. Finally, after someone was literally yelling (yes, YELLING) in the hallway, right outside our door at about 3:30am, I asked them to please just tell the security guard to camp out in the hallway of the 23rd floor, because honestly, by the time security makes it up to the 23rd floor, the offending party has usually ducked into their room. After that, I didn't hear anyone in the hallway.My daughters and I got very little sleep, and so the hotel comped us with four free breakfast buffet vouchers. The breakfast buffet was really good, actually. They offered a custom omelet bar, and the cook also make a sunny-side up for one of my daughters. They had large croissants, bagels, English Muffins, melon, pineapple, yogurt, sausages and bacon, really good red potatoes, cereal, and several other items. Further, gratuity and tax were included in the vouchers, so it was completely free.They also have excellent breakfast room service choices. I had the caramel apple french toast, which was great. My family enjoyed everything they ordered, as well.Here's the thing - I had requested a room in a quiet part of the hotel. I absolutely got the opposite. It was very, very noisy, but that was because of poorly behaved guests. The rooms were not bad, but the carpet was wrinkled and was fraying at the edges, and the toilets didn't work very well. One of the toilets kept making water surging noises for several minutes after each flush, and then one time the handle simply wouldn't flush. It didn't do anything at all.One last thing - this is one of the hotels that partners with the American Girl Doll store, and so their clients include a lot of kids. They should have the Disney channel, but they don't.


Room Tip: You will still hear the ambulance sirens on the 23rd floor.

"Our family of four stayed one night, New Year's Eve. We booked through Expedia, which rates this hotel 4.5 stars. The location is great, right on Michigan Ave. the hotel was fine, but not 4.5 stars, in my opinion. Since it is billed as an ""all suite"" hotel, I expected there would be ample space for our family. When we arrived, we were told we had a room with one king bed, and since we booked through Expedia, there wasn't anything the front desk clerk could do about it, which I understood. He offered to send a roll away up and assured me it would be big enough for my 8 and 10 year old children. Our room ended up being a single room with a king size bed, two chairs, and a desk. No different from any other basic hotel room, and certainly not what I would consider a ""suite"". The rollaway arrived and it was a twin. Long story short, it worked out for one night. Had it been a longer stay, or had I paid more for the room, I would be upset."
Great first impression! The valet and front door staff our the friendliest I have ever experienced. Not just when we arrived but every time we left or entered the hotel. Front desk was friendly but seemed to be understaffed. Line at check in but not a long wait. We called the front desk during our stay a couple times and was put on hold for quite a few min. (no answer at concierge desk) and another time after multiple tries never got through. The room was nice I would say average. The size was great for the 5 of us. Room service staff was great but the food could have been warmer both days we ordered breakfast. Overall a pleasant stay with a very convenient location to everything we had on our agenda.
"Amazing stay, we came to Chicago to celebrate our daughter's 10th birthday at American Girl--was just perfect all the way around and can't really express how impressed we were with every staff member we encountered. We are already planning another family get away to Chicago just because our experience was so great! I'm a hard traveler to impress and I was completely surprised at how awesome the complete experience was for us and our kids. Kudos to you!"
"Very disappointed overall . Location is exceptional, front desk courteous but the following were concerning : Hall carpets worn , patch work on hall wall paper terrible , guest room tv outdated and dark picture (bedroom area) , towels had holes , furniture upholstery outdated , found previous guests food in fridge , hair dryer missing , precious guest shopping receipts under Ottoman , robe missing belt , and bed side telephone doesn't work --Room service milk shakes were great though and again location is perfect for dining on rush street or shopping on Michigan avenue"
"We always enjoy staying at the Omni on Michigan Avenue. I suggest becoming a preferred guest. There are perks like getting complimentary tea or coffee delivered to your room every morning. I usually reserve on-line and get a ""parking and breakfast"" package, which seems to be a good value if you have a car with you. The breakfast buffet is always enjoyable. I like to request a corner room. The service is wonderful and everything is clean. Great location in the middle of Michigan Avenue."
"The hotel is a great place if you want to shop. Walking distance to The Art Institute The King suite needed a few upgrades but was fine. We ate at the restuarant for one night and it was ok. There is a great breakfast place e.leaven just about a block away if you want a good bagel. There is a great Italian deli with bakery about a block away.


Room Tip: Michigan Avenue for view but a little noisy with traffic

"The hotel was clean and very spacious. Great location, walking distance to almost everything. The bed was not very comfortable but the hotel itself was good. The staff was friendly and helpful.I would definately stay here again. The only thing I didn't like was the overnight parking rates. I know it's downtown Chicago and most things are a little pricey but when you're staying at the hotel, parking shouldn't be so expensive. It would have been cheaper to park in private lot."
"First of all; remember this is an ""expensive"" city & not your hometown hotel; expect a little ambient noise of fire engines etc--get over it. Or don't come to any metropolitan area...Overall I give this Omni high grades (not perfect-nearly so though). I want clean; it was. I want courtesy & not fawning or obsequious service; got this too. This is near luxury with reasonable rates.The Sunday morning brunch is a reasonable $30 & an extremely reasonable $14 for our grandsons too. Restaurant has expansive view of Michigan Ave from the 4 th floor perspective. We also had some nice drinks & Cognac the evening prior with nice price point."
"This is our first time at the Omni Chicago but we always enjoy our experience at an Omni. Top notch service and you should definitely become a preferred guest. You can't beat the location right in the middle of the magnificent mile, we walked to the American girl doll store and other stores several times throughout the trip. I would have definitely given it five stars except I booked the room for two adults and one six year old child yet there was only one bed in the room. We had to pay an extra $20 for the roll away bed for my daughter. It seems if they ask the number of people and ages when you book they should include the accommodations in the price of the room. Also, I had been watching the price on the Omni website as I wanted to book the American girl package but when I went to actually book the price had been raised over a hundred dollars for all the rooms. I was able to go back to Expedia and get it for much cheaper. I would expect to be able to get the cheapest price on the Omni website when logged in as a preferred member."
"Stayed at the Omni Chicago from December 19th thru the 21st and it was the best stay in Chicago I have encountered. I have been to Chicago many times, but this is my first stay at the Omni and I look forward to many more stays. The hotel and staff are wonderful. I un-expectedly received a tray with 4 delicious cake samples for my birthday free of charge and it was just so special. When in Chicago...by all means stay at the Omni. Thank you."
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. If I hear that phrase one more time from the staff 'm going to throw up. Terrible. Worst hotel we have stayed at. We moved three rooms in a four day stay. Beware the cold and drafty rooms on the building corners. We were moved from 816 to 817. From cold to colder. We were then moved to 1415. Less cold but terrible shower. Could not control the hot water. Scalding is a problem. For all our trouble we were given a $100 Omni gift certificate. Only good thing about this hotel is the location and the front door staff. Never be back!
Nice location in downtown Chicago. Only negative is there is renovations going on and if you get a room close to a floor under construction it can be loud and wake you before planned. Staff was very friendly and front desk and doormen were great. Also room service was rude when bringing cookies and milk to our room for the kids as we were not told the delivery was suppose to be between 6 and 8. And we asked for it at 830
"We had a wonderful trip with our family; two adults and a 15 year old and 17 year old. The bell staff, parking and check in staff were excellent and interactive. When we arrived back after having dinner there were milk and cookies delivered for the kids. They at first thought it was corny but quickly devoured them....Two TV's was definitely a plus so that all could watch what they wanted when we were in the room. Many plugs available as well as closet space to house our many items we brought with us in our car ride. We had a great day of shopping and fun."
"What a great place, the rooms are great. The room we had, had a living room separated from the bedroom and bathroom, three rooms total. The bedroom had a king size bed, two end tables with lamps, telephone, clock and extra electrical outlets attached to the end table for easy access. Also has a TV, dresser drawers, closet with a safe and robes. The living room has two chairs a table and lamp, a writing desk and chair, a bar area with a sink, coffee maker and ice box filled with goodies (at a cost). The service from the moment you check in is great all the way from the doormen to housekeeping. Just to let everyone know is that they are upgrading all of their rooms they should be finished by March/April 2015. Can't wait to come back and check it out. Just a suggestion join their club you get great services for free.

"We had an upper floor suite for our three day stay at the Omni. It was well furnished and very comfortable, plus had a nice view. Wi fi was free which is always good. Valet parking costs an eye watering $60 a day, but you can self park for $37 a day in an underground on the next block, and the pedestrian exit from the parking is directly across the road from the Omni. The menu in the hotel restaurant looked a bit limited (we don't eat beef), but being tired on our first night we ate there and were pleasantly surprised with the quality of the food. The hotel is well placed on the Magnificent mile and close to a lot of high end shops and there are lots of restaurants close by just one street back. Its easy to get around Chicago by bus and worth buying a 25 hour pass for the buses overhead train, which you can get from the Wallgreens shop near the hotel.


Room Tip: Higher floors will have a view

"This Omni continues to lack good management. Fortunately, the staff is wonderful (especially in the 626 restaurant & bar, and Mirham the doorman) which is why we return. The food & beverage is very good. The rooms are a bit weary & dreary but I understand that renovations are underway. Unfortunately, on our recent visit my request for a renovated room was ignored even though I am at the highest level of their loyalty program. The Select Guest loyalty program is no enticement to stay at an Omni."
"Hotel room was showing wear. Carpeting in poor condition. Furniture beat. TVs old. Room needs to be updated. I really like Omni Chicago. Staff is always friendly. Great location. We were initially given a 9th floor room and our reservations were for an upper floor. We changed rooms to the 18th floor. This was OK, but still not an upper floor. It was really difficult to raise and lower the window shade for the window over the bed (we had a corner room). I am 6'2"" and my wife would not be able to raise and lower without standing on the bed."
"Just finished a 3 might stay at the Omni Chicago, I chose the hotel for the location close to Michigan Avenue (Christmas shopping time), River North for the restaurants, and still accessible to the loop for my meetings. Excellent customer service, nice room, furnishings, the on-site restaurant for breakfast was excellent, used the fitness center and it was big with high quality machines. So the two problems were the internet service (I had to change rooms to get connected, and then it was slow and somewhat intermittent.) The other challenge was that the windows were drafty, and the furnace ran almost full time trying to heat the room. I finally figured out to pile the pillows against the curtains to keep the draft off the bed. Not sure if this is a problem in all the rooms, or just my King Suite, which was on the corner (what I had.) I would stay again, but maybe not in the winter.


Room Tip: My room faced south, and despite being on a low floor was quiet.

"Found a great deal through Travelzoo that includes room, parking and $30 voucher for $189. Considering the normal rate of over $250/night just for the room, I was lucky to have found this awesome deal! Being my first time in Chicago, I had no idea what to expect in the windy city. After searching through many hotel choices, I liked the Omni because it was one of the few hotels that offer a room with living area and a spacious bathroom. Most of the hotels in Chicago only had very tiny rooms with rates over $200/night. Omni hotel is located close to Miracle mile where you can also find lots of popular wine bars, restaurants and tourist attractions. If you plan on going to Chicago for business, this is a great hotel for ease of public transportation and location. The bar inside the hotel offered one of the best cocktails and desserts you can enjoy after a long day of walking around the city or after work. Service is top notch and overall everything was clean, well kept and quiet. The only downside was having to deal with small TV's in both the living area and the bedroom."
"This was my second time staying at the Omni Chicago. All the rooms are suites which I like & the staff is always pleasant. The recently upgraded the furniture in the lobby & my only suggestion would be to upgrade the rooms. The carpet was coming up in ours. The room was clean & beds were comfortable so that made up for it a little. Also, just thought the quality of the food didn't meet the price but hotel food is usually overpriced everywhere you go."
"We were greeted by the most friendly doorman! A great way to start your vacation. The bellman inside was really nice, as well. Gentleman at reception wasn't very friendly, but the woman on the phone when inquiring about wifi was so kind and helpful. Concierge was knowledgeable and enjoyed the pub he recommended. Our room is very comfortable and roomy, too. Beds were amazing, slept so good. Room clean, no view for us, but spent little time in room. Would definitely come back!


Room Tip: Ask for Michigan Avenue view!

"It has the best location just in the middle of Michigan Avenue and that was my principal reason for staying there. Rooms are very comfortable since they have a separate living room with TV. We had a bad situation when checked in since they assigned us a room on the side of the building where they did some maintenance work that day and we had no water in the bathroom and if some water came out, it was sooo dirty. After some time trying solve the problem, we had to move to another room and gave us that night free of charge. I will never understand why assign rooms where they know may have some problems and make guests go thru all this when they had empty rooms in other areas where maintenance did not affect them. It was my birthday and my husband pre-ordered a bottle of champagne to our original room for that night and by the time this ordeal finished, it was too late and we just went to sleep and had to celebrate the next day. After this, everything continued fine during our stay."
I've stayed here several times and am always impressed. The rooms are large with great views. The staff is professional and friendly. Service is spot on and the property is clean with attention to detail. Excellent location on Michigan Ave. What more can I say. Great fitness center although it was pretty warm for my run this morning. I really like this hotel and will continue to make it my first choice when staying in the city.
"We stayed here for two nights for a ""stay cation"". We had a fabulous experience. Immediately on our arrival, the bell staff presented our 4 & 6 year olds with complementary backpacks filled with crayons, activities, a few other surprises. Our kids were ecstatic! On our first night there, our kids were presented with milk & cookies before bed. What a fun treat! The room was very spacious and clean and we had more than enough room for all of us. The pool was fun and our kids loved it. Room service was excellent and the quality of the food was very good. The location is great - we made it easily here from OTC and loved being in the center of everything. We were very pleased with every hotel employee we came into contact with and loved feeling like they were happy to have our family as guests. We will definitely be staying here again!"
"Not what I'd hoped for esp since Oprah's guests used to stay here. The bedroom in our suite was freezing no matter how high we set the thermostat in the sitting room. There was old toothpaste on the sink bowl from previous guest & the sink water ran rust colored due to previous issues w/the mini fridges on that side of the bldg. Mini fridge was warm....never got cold. Pocket door kept falling off the hinge. This room def needed some new paint. Our room never got refreshed on the 2nd day even after having called to have it done. Had to call for more towels & toiletries. There was an issue w/our gift card upon check in for the room package we chose. Took 24 hours to resolve a piddly $10 gift card changing it from iTunes to a Starbucks. Parking is very expensive, but we used it. Location is perfect & customer service is very good, but will not stay here again or recommend."
"I have stayed at the Omni on and off over the last 20 years and my most recent visit over the Thanksgiving weekend was somewhat of a disappointment. The lower level, concierge level, and dining levels look great - crisp, clean and well maintained. The elevators and corridors are very tired and need to be renovated. Our room had a great view of Michigan Avenue, but it was in the same condition as the corridors..very tired. Housekeeping must have taken the weekend off because this room was scummy...a point I made to the gal at the check-in counter, but she offered no concession. We were in room 801 and I would like to thank the families traveling together in room #'s 803, 805?, and 809?...it's nice to have your own, personal hotel corridor to run around in..isn't it? I felt like like I was at a motel where there was a gymnastics or softball tournament going on. Doors propped open, kids running from room to room...good times for them, I'm sure. When I spend nearly $800.00 for two nights of lodging, I expect more than what I can get at a motel on I-94. Make no mistake, you are paying for the location...Disney, Cole Haan, Nike, etc. right across the street. I just expected more from the Omni. Given the vast number of choices available in the city, I won't be returning to the Omni for our annual summer trip."
"We stayed at the Omni during the Festival of Lights. We got a great deal through another website that included a $30 food voucher per night. the hotel furnishings are outdated and a little worn/dirty, but the overall room was satisfactory. We used our food voucher the first night in the hotel restaurant. Very pricy food in my opinion but tasty and we had excellent attentive service. Our server took the time to explain each item on our dish and came back an appropriate amount of times to check on us. After the food voucher, our out of pocket was still $80. Breakfast is not included so be prepared to pay $25 each for the limited buffet. The work out facility was pretty good. Maintenance staff was seen both times we were there -- cleaning and making sure equipment was working. We received turn down service which was a nice surprise. our second night was not great. the guests in the room next to ours had a loud party. we could hear/feel the vibration of the base music in our room. They were smoking something strong; you could smell it before turning the corner to the hall. people were constantly knocking on their door well past 1 a.m. the hotel has a 10 pm quiet policy which obviously they do not enforce. Besides the loud party and the absence of a sofa in the room, we had a pleasant experience. would possibly consider this hotel again."
Omni Hotel always make me feel very welcome. Its location in city is perfect and level of service is excellent. In addition the restaurant serve great food. A pleasant experience with their loyalty services being excellent. The ability to order complementary morning beverage always work great and useful for international travellers as me. Rooms are old and in need of renovation which will happen now to my understanding but layout and equipment in rooms are very good.
"The hotel is a little bit old fashioned, but has style and a certain cosy atmosphere. The staff is extremely friendly and caring. The room had space enough and was astonishing quiet, although facing the lifely Magnificent Mile. As a select guest we had free wifi and got a warm or cold drink for free every morning. The Pool area and the Fitness center were clean and quite okay. The view from the restaurant and bar on 3rd floor is amazing. Many fancy shops, museums and really spectacular restaurants are located within walking distance. Valet parking is very expensive, so we parked our car at a self parking on Rush Ave. The shuttle bus for the McCormick Convention Center took off just across the North Michigan Ave. Great location both for business and pleasure !"
"This is my first review ever... because our stay at Omni Hotel is worth taking the time out of my day to applaud them on a job well done. My family and I stayed at Omni to celebrate my daughter's 3rd Birthday with hope for a great view of the Magnificent Mile Lights Festival. We are extremely grateful that they were able to accommodate our request for a room with a view. Additionally, the Hotel was very inviting towards families as they greeted my daughters (3 and 4) at arrival with cute book bags with goodies. Later in the evening, staff surprised us with a complimentary birthday cake, card, milk and cookies. The room was clean and spacious. The in-room dining was exquisite and delivery was prompt. Thank you for the kids cups, which made dinner fun for my kids. We will definitely return and highly recommend the Hotel! It's the small details and friendly staff that separates this Hotel from the rest. Hands down best in class!"
"This has always been my preferred hotel when I come to Chicago, either on business or vacation. I have never had a bad experience here. My only comment is that the restaurant menu is rather limited. On the PLUS side, in addition to PERFECT LOCATION on the Miracle Mile of Michigan Avenue, it is directly across the street from the downtown Chicago APPLE STORE. I have been an Apple Computer user since 1978, and on two occasions in the last 10 years I needed some help and could simply walk across the street and get the problem solved."
"The appearance is not inviting since the ground floor lobby is small and one needs to take a lift (elevator) to the reception on floor 3. Here the staff are friendly, efficient, helpful and the reception area is comfortable. Rooms are good. On this trip I was upgraded, but on previous trips (not reported in TripAdvisor) standard rooms have also been nice. Everything is laid on in the room, but my regular grumble in the US is about paying fro WiFi. Otherwise this was without fault."
"Rooms need to be updated, which is in the works I believe, but carpet is old and worn, bathrooms need to improved and TVs need to be updated and reception needs to be improved. Food service is average and needs to be brought up a couple of levels. With that said, staff is very friendly and looking for ways to serve. Location can not be beaten for a downtown hotel but you have to be able to handle the traffic noise from the street below. A good place to stay if the price is right but it will be better when renovations are complete."
"I stayed at this hotel in November 2014 for a business trip. The staff accommodated my request to have a room on a high floor with a view. I highly recommend joining their loyalty program. If you are not a member, you can register online or at check-in. The benefits include the following: early check-in, late check-out, morning beverage of your choice, shoe shine, pressing for clothes, and upgrade options. The membership is free and the benefits are worth signing up for the program.The in-room dining was great, especially breakfast. I was disappointed with the prices, but when compared to other hotels in Chicago, they are nearly the same.If you are in Chicago, I recommend this hotel.


Room Tip: Rooms that are higher with a view of the Great Lakes or Michigan Avenue are great.

"I can't say enough about the wonderful staff at the Omni. The bellmen,reception desk and concierge all provided wonderful suggestions, service, directions and helpful information for us as weekend tourists. However, our room was a shabby suite. Carpet was worn and torn in spots, two small chairs and a desk comprised the ""living room"" area. To say the least, we were disappointed in the lack of decor. Having stayed at numerous Omni hotels we expected better."
"Granite the rooms need some updates, old t.v. in the bedroom, sitting room... chairs vs. couch etc. but overall rooms are fine. The views we had in our room were outstanding with a small view of the lake through the buildings.The location and the welcoming staff makes the Omni in Chicago a very good choice in downtown hotels. Sign up for there rewards card and get turn down service, free wifi and a beverage of you choice delivered to your room in the morning,.

"From the first moment we felt welcomed. The staff at the door, front desk, ( Nicky was so very nice), and house keeping, ( yes, we got 15 extra hangars!) made for a great stay. The staff at the door was very good in pointing us out to where we wanted to go. One time they were concerned that we wanted to walk to Second City. We did and it was just fine. On our return, they asked about it!This hotel is in a great location. The suite was well laid out and there was a lot of storage. The bathroom was a good size. Only complaint was the toilet made a weird noise. We were on the 23rd floor and street noise did not bother us at all.

Very welcoming staff and helpful concierge. Check-in was very timely the room was very lovely. The turndown service was amazing and the young lady who did the turndown service was just the most friendly and wonderful person ever. I highly recommend this place the location is perfect and the staff goes far and beyond. I shall return and stay here again. They were also very accommodating and was able to put me in a to bed sweet when I booked a king. Just a loss of words for great service.
"I am a frequent business and personal traveler and this hotel was so impressive. it is immediately apparent what the hotel's #1 priority is - the customer service was impeccable. Every time we walked into or out of the hotel, we were greeted. After the first day, the bellman remembered me, my office address and hailed a taxi for me every morning without me having to ask. We received (free) bottles of water every morning and evening. The staff could not have been more accommodating, the location is perfect - right in the middle of awesome shopping, restaurants and bars and the bed was super comfortable. I know at times, the room rates can get high, but, I often travel to Chicago for work and pleasure and will stay at the Omni when I can (when the price is right). Most other hotel chains should take lessons in customer service from Omni."
"We went to Chicago for a long weekend with two kids under 7 and two grandparents over 70. The staff are so friendly and nice, and greeted the kids with cute complimentary backpacks. After a long day of travel, we were greeted with low fat organic milk and cookies in the room, the perfect snack for our kids. In addition, we found the room cleaner, quieter, more spacious, and better decorated than we expected."
"Stayed Sept during IMTS Show, hotel itself is well situated downtown, good access to pretty much everything you need. Room was a King Suite, small for a suite room but well appointed, nice bathroom, bedroom and living space. Was extremely quiet during the night, not sure if this is time of year or like this always. Relative to other hotels with equal facilities this is very expensive, we ended up here as a result of booking late and grabbing what we could get, rooms were North of 250 a night, restaurant was expensive, bacon/eggs/coffee/toast at 30$ for breakfast, that really small bottle of wine on top of the mini bar, 35$. Nice hotel, comfortable stay, just be aware of price point."
"This is a small all-suites property well located near Michigan Ave and very close to many favorite restaurants. Comfortable as it is (and it is comfortable) the staff is the reason I look forward to stays there and try to book there. Always very friendly and helpful. this stay I managed to leave cash and credit cards in the safe (YIKES!). Glenn retrieved for me, sent via FedEx to my next destination, and totally relieved my mind that all would be well. I was very sick during the stay and the young lady who brought my tea was very concerned and offered to bring more tea or honey--whatever I needed. Because I was so sick I stayed in the suite a lot--really comfortable bed. It was actually a good place to be sick. Very very comfortable. When I was feeling a bit better I ordered room service--excellent eggs--which is very hard to do for in-room dining."
"We stayed over Labor Day weekend. Check in was efficient and quick. Rooms were large, beds comfortable. The room was very quiet. We slept great. The location was fantastic, took the train from the airport to a stop a few blocks away, and location on michigan ave means you are right in all the action. The rooms were a bit dated, but that wasn't a huge concern for us. Maid service twice a day meant it was very clean. Would definitely stay again."
"We stayed here for a conference and was very pleased with everything.We had a room on the 17th floor, quiet and great view.We had a flat screen TV and not one problem with the bed or anything in the room.The service we had was always great, the staff was more than friendly.Yes, the parking was outrageous, we used Spot Hero and got a great price, with a very short 3 minute walk to the hotel.We found that the elevators were never a problem for us.Probably the only drawback for us was the terrible price for wifi, which we did not use."
"We stayed 4 nights at the Omni on Michigan Avenue, lobby and bar/restaurant very nice. Rest of property could do with an overhaul. While rooms are suites they are really not much larger than an average bedroom with a wall put in. Strange set up with elevator to lobby on 3rd floor and then another to the rooms. Fair enough, but when elevators were very busy no public access to stairs down, had to be escorted by staff. With lots of other options in the area would not choose to return to Omni."
"This was our second time to stay here. It is a good location to visit the sights in Chicago. They are nice rooms and the hotel has a restaurant, bar and concierge. We had the bed and breakfast plan so we did eat at the buffet. It had a good selection of fruits, breads and other breakfast items including an omelet station. The concierge was helpful for the stay last year and we also had some help from them this time. Be sure to tip them! The hotel will undergo a remodel starting in December and it is about time the rooms were freshened up. They will also be relocating the thermostats as the current location just below the vent will cause them to shut off too soon, not a good situation if you are trying to cool the room. The relocated thermostat across the room will solve this problem. We would stay here again."
We stayed here for 4 days for a wedding so the rate we paid was good. The excellent service starts with the excellent doormen and check-in personnel. Everyone is extremely pleasant and helpful. The cleaning staff keeps the hotel and rooms spotless. We thought the room was lovely and in good shape. A couch would have been preferred over the 2 chairs but not a deal breaker. The location is excellent and staff. Easy to get cabs to get around. Easy walk to the Navy Pier. Would recommend to others for a nice stay and good rates.
"Sure the location is great, right on the heart of shopping and dinning. The staff was very friendly and helpful. the room, however, was dated, oddly distributed and uncomfortable. There was a single bed (not even a king!) and a separate sitting area with 2 chairs in front of the TV (no couch). The shower door was hard to open and close. There was brown water coming out from the shower head (yuk!) and our trash wasn't emptied on a daily basis. I understand that for a big city like this location comes at a price, but when you label your establishment as 4 stars it really is disappointing."
"I was recently in Chicago on business and stayed at this Omni for 3 nights. An all suite Hotel, in the heart of it all. Great location. I was not familiar with Omni, have usually stayed at Hiltons and Marriotts, I would say that this Hotel is a step above the big chain Hotels. Rooms again are all suites, nice to have a separate area to work. Front office staff were attentive, friendly and helpful. Very nice amenities, i.e. you can order a cup or two of hot coffee delivered to your room when you wake up, complimentary. Room service had a nice menu and I believe good value for the dollar. I believe they will be doing a rooms renovation soon. The spaciousness of the rooms are great. My view was of an empty building, I could see right into the office space, so I am sure they could see right into my room. Kept the curtains shut when I was in the room. We had a meeting there, the facilities and banquet staff were considerate, quiet, respectful of our meeting. And the food was well presented and nice variety. Very nice meeting rooms. The meeting room overlooked Michigan Ave, it can be a little noisy, especially with the afternoon street entertainment, we had the Blues Brothers one afternoon for a few hours. Had an hour one afternoon to myself, so ran over to the new Eataly, just 2 blocks away. Which is fantastic. All in all, will be back."
"I recently stayed at this hotel for 6 nights during a business trip. I was not getting a room at my regular hotels and my agent booked me at the Omni. I was pleasantly surprised by the hotel.The pros:- the check-in and check out were swift.- the rooms are very spacious, with a seperate bedroom and a living room and decent sized bathroom.- rooms have 2 TVs, a coffee machine, a sink and generally all the amenities that a good hotel should have. The AC was adequate and kept the room at the right temperature.- the hotel has a very lively bar and we enjoyed spending couple of nights there. - the gym at the hotel is pretty good and they also have a small swimming pool attached.- the location of the hotel is quite perfect. Its right in the centre of Michigan avanue with all the shops and restaurants. All major sights in downtown Chicago are a mere 5-10 mins walk, including the lakefront beach.- the staff, concierge were very helpful and smiling. The wifi throughout the hotel was strong. A few cons though:- the rooms while being spacious, are a bit dated, especially the bathrooms. The tub was a bit old and the fixtures clearly need an upgrade sometime soon.- The 2 lift system, one to get to the lobby and the other to get to the room can get a bit annoying at times.- Given that its in downtown Chicago, doesnt have much of a view except that of surrounding buildings. Overall, i was quite impressed with the hotel and would clearly recommend it to the others. Dont go expecting a 7-star luxurious property. Its a very good hotel thar tries hard to please its guests.

"The Omni Hotel on Michigan Avenue and Huron was perfect for our first time visit to the city of Chicago. The staff from doormen, housekeeping, front desk, concierge, and management could not have been more pleasant and guest service oriented. This exceptionally clean and well-appointed all-suite hotel offers a bedroom area with television and a separate sitting area divided by two frosted glass doors with television, 2 cushioned chairs and ottoman, wet-bar and sinks with granite counter tops, desk and a foyer area. You can rent a small refrigerator for a nominal fee of $15.00 per week. That was a great investment because small local grocery stores are within walking distance of the hotel. Hint: have them lock the mini-bar and remove all snacks and temptations to nibble on way too expensive goodies. We had 3 rooms on the 23rd floor facing the city view. The hotel is not tall enough to facilitate a lake view, but we could not complain. Our family had traveled to Chicago for our son to ask his girlfriend to marry him at Buckingham Fountain and to our surprise and pleasure; a complimentary bottle of champagne was left in the room for us to toast the occasion. The front desk and housekeeping staff also went above and beyond when our son and his intended arrived from Orlando with suitcases and clothes that were soaked from Southwest leaving them on the tarmac uncovered during a storm. At 1:30 a.m. housekeeping took all the sopping wet clothes, dried and folded them to be returned to his room 1 hour later at no charge. Now that is how a hotel should handle a stressed guest through an issue that was not even their fault. The words catering and caring fall short of how the housekeeping staff on the 23rd floor demonstrates their skills in hospitality.Our beds were comfortable, turn down service on weekends, fresh linens and towels every day, and the time lapse between phone call to front desk and housekeeping responding was always within 15 minutes, even with 3 refrigerators for our rooms. Elevator services and speed were not an issue at the Omni. Quick and reliable service means we never stood and waited and waited and waited. The concierges were friendly and knowledgeable, even for our unusual questions; hence our excursion to the Buck Town area proved he knew exactly what we were looking for.The Omni is located within a few blocks of great restaurants and the stroll back to the hotel is a great way to take in the sights and work off a good meal. The garden sidewalks almost make you forget you are in the heart of a major city. Beautiful, just beautiful. Chicago is a city that makes out-of-towners feel welcome! Our thanks to Patrick Hatton, General Manager for the Omni, and his assistant Tabitha and all his staff. Every great run hotel starts with great management and Mr. Hatton does a spectacular job. We will be back!

"Great service! Would always recommend Omni Hotels. If you want a room with a view you may need to request that (we did not have). We used text to retrieve car and it did not work. Staff always extremely helpful and willing to accommodate. Food was delicious in the restaurant. Location was perfect. We will use Omni Hotels whenever possible due to the incredible staff and service. Always clean rooms, friendly welcome, and great memories."
"I arrived to find 1 valet working while 10 stood around, no bell service to carry bags, and to top it off they screwed up my reservation. When I brought this to the attention of the front staff they seemed sort of apologetic, but the attitude was very smug and very much made me feel unwelcome.After an hour I finally did get to speak with a manager who rectified some of the issues regarding the reservations, but the damage was done at that point. Dinner was missed, my wife and kids were upset, and I started wondering why we hadn't stayed somewhere else. Frankly, I felt as if I was being discriminated against because I was white and professional. The rooms and facilities were nothing exciting, I would put them on par with a Hilton Garden Inn (not a dig at HGI, but the price ranges are drastically different).Better accommodations and MUCH better service are to be found in Chicago. If you're planning a trip I would look elsewhere unless it was an incredibly cheap rate and your expectations are low."
"The location on Michigan Ave. is perfect for visitors to the city. Nearby shopping and restaurants all within walking distance. I appreciate the all suite aspect of the hotel. Although we traveled without children, I would definitely choose this hotel as family friendly. The staff were efficient and helpful. The hotel is a very good value. Would reccommend asking for a suite on a high floor and facing north for the best views."
"When we requested a lake view they said they didn't have many. Needless to say we were delighted with a narrow slice view of Lake Michigan through some buildings! Close to many attractions and the shops on the Magnificent mile. We had the breakfast buffet which was wonderful; omelets, toast, pastries, fruit, etc. Walked to Bobby's bike rentals and the river tour! We found a trader joe's nearby (buy a reusable shopping bag as a Chicago souvenir). There is a swimming pool with two outdoor deck areas with chaise lounges. My only complaint was that the mattress pad felt a little crinkly through the sheets, my husband didn't notice."
"Stayed at Omni 3 nights last weekend. Great location for tourist: close to shopping, attractions, and CTA (train/bus). Spacious suite with 2 double beds, large bathroom, and living room. TV in bedroom and living room. Comfy bed. Would have given 5/5, but decor needs refreshed (our rug was rippled, wallpaper peeling a little).Excellent hotel staff: from check-in (they had a feather free room ready!!!), to complimentary wine in honour of our special celebration, to cleanliness throughout hotel. SPECIAL SHOUT OUT TO CONCIERGE MARCUS, who was so helpful and patient.Would recommend this to couples or families or solo traveller, and will definitely look at Omni hotel in other cities based on this experience. 4.5/5

"I walked by this hotel for 10 yrs and never thought of it as anything other than the ""official hotel of the Oprah Witney show."" I moved away a year ago and was back in town on business. My company put me the Omni and I was pleasantly surprised. (So much so that I've since stayed at another Omni in Houston -which was great!). I had a king room with a separate living area. The bed was comfortable, the pillows soft and abundant. The living area was spacious with 2 club chairs, a desk and a wet bar. The bathroom was large. My only comment to the hotel staff is turn the TVs off. The maid staff turns the TV on, tunes it to the hotel channel and leaves it on after they leave. It's left on for hours until the guest returns to the room and turns it off. Huge waste of electricity."
"This is a well located hotel for those visiting the city as tourists. Possibly not so well located for business travellers as it is two thirds of the way down the Mag Mile and therefore well outside the business district.That said the rooms are large. We had two genuine suites. With TV in both the lounge and bedroom.Staff were friendly and helpful and very easy to get too and from everything we wanted to see and plenty of food options in the area.The only factor holding back the fifth star is that wifi is a chargeable extra, which I think is very out of date, and there are not enough charging points in the room. Ended up unplugging lights to charge up phones, cameras etc. I would certainly use this hotel again."
"I stayed for a week in a deluxe suite (queen size bed). The room was on the 8th floor and thus a bit dim (the photo on the webpage is certainly a bit sugarcoating). However, cleanliness was excellent as was the quality of the matress, so the stay was quite comfy overall. All the staff was very friendly and helpful. The breakfast buffet in the restaurant was excellent. Overall I would certainly recommend the hotel."
"Love this place for traveling with family. Usually we stay at the Drake but being a historic hotel, the rooms are small and the hotel is not extremely family friendly. This place is 100% family friendly. Extra space in the suite was a great perk. Staff were always super helpful- especially the bell hop and the people working downstairs at the entrance. They even gave my children bags with goodies to keep them busy! Beds are comfortable. Bathroom was large. Wet bar as a nice perk! Just wish they had a mini fridge at no extra cost. Will stay with family again!

"Chicago was our first spot on this year's holiday. I chose the Omni because of the overall reviews, its situation right on the Magnificent Mile but mainly because our family of 5 could share a suite; this is relatively rare particularly in big cities where room size is often at a premium.The hotel was in a great spot - we were able to walk to Bobby's Bike Hike and then back from the CAF boat tour which meant that sightseeing was easy and we could also take advantage of the shops that were close by. Yes the bedroom was a little tired in places and the TV in the bedroom was pretty old but hey we were in Chicago in wonderful weather to enjoy this great city and not to sit in our room watching American television. We don't usually eat in our hotels preferring to get out and try smaller restaurants. We had planned to have breakfast in Sunny Side Up before our bike tour but were up so early that it wasn't open. We therefore took breakfast in the Omni in the fabulous 4th floor dining room overlooking the street. It was first class and well worth the money and the staff were delightful. We would definitely stay again if the chance comes up.

"All the good reviews talk about the only good thing about the hotel, the location. It's awful. It takes 10 minutes to catch the 2 different elevators required to go to the room. Broken security locks in the room, awful decorating, and what I think is a 21 inch tube television, which I cannot see from the bed very well. I am checking out today and going to find another hotel. Badly in need of a renovation, I've stayed at many great Omni Hotels."
"We spent 4 nights at the Omni Chicago in July. Hotel was very nice and great location! Staff was very friendly and accommodating. Request a corner room on a higher floor. Lots of windows and great views of the city. Walking distance to Navy Pier, Lou Malnati's pizza, and great shopping everywhere. Taxi to O'Hare was about $40. You can take the train, but it's about a 4 block walk from the train station to the Omni. Rooms were a little on the small side, but we didn't spend a lot of time in the room so it was fine. Sirens are sounding frequently, but that was expected in downtown Chicago. I would stay at this hotel again!"
"Vacationing in Chicago and stayed at the Omni Hotel. The service at this hotel was excellent for us. The front desk staff was extremely courteous and helpful. Checking in only took a matter of minutes. Our room was comfortable and quiet. The front door staff was awesome!!! They were so friendly and always willing to help us with recommendations or directions. Whenever we return to Chicago, we will definitely stay at the Omni again! Thanks for helping to make our vacation a great one!!"
"Spent 2 nights with my entire family at the Homewood Suites on Grand Ave. From the time we arrived, valet staff is awesome, to when we checked out, we had no problems. Check in was speedy and the express check out saves lots of time when you leave. The breakfast and dinner were very good. More than enough selections and plenty of food. Wish the seating area was bigger since so many guests take advantage of the free meals. Also slows the elevators down during meals times since there are only two of them. Pool was great for the grandkids, plenty of towels and was never crowded. Rooms were plenty big and beds were comfy. For the price I would totally stay there again."
"The Homewood suites on E. Grand provides a fantastic value in a tremndous location. Just a block off the Magnificent Mile, the hotel is conviently located to some of Chicagos best dinning, shopping and siteseeing. The only issue we encounted was the lack of space avaialble for the breakfast service and the seeming inability to keep dishes and silverwear available. Other then that, it was an excellent expereince and value. The rooms were clean, the hotel was quite and the facility is is pretty good shape."
"Spring Break trip with the kids. The location is superb, very close to most of the big things most people would want to do and centrally located for everything else. The rooms are fine in size for 2-4 people, families larger than that should bring sleeping bags. The breakfast buffet was a bit lacking this time, they food ran out constantly and the pancakes/french toast were okay at best. There is not nearly enough seating to accommodate the crowds for the breakfast and dinner meals (but then again, it's ""free"", so...) Only having two elevators is probably the biggest problem, the waits can be a bit excessive at times.The room are very clean, in room kitchen is nice and the staff is very helpful.

"We stayed here with our 2 year old son and it was perfect. Great location because you can walk to restaurants, bus stops, all of the shops, and Navy Pier is about a 20 minute walk away. There is a cool indoor rooftop pool. The hotel room was a bit outdated, but it was clean. We had a great view of the city lights from our window. We got a park and stay package, and the valet were always so helpful and friendly. The complimentary breakfast is ok. It worked well for us because we could quick scoot to the lobby for bite to eat and head out for the day without having to think about making breakfast or finding a restaurant for breakfast. Get there early though. It can be quite busy. Overall this was a great value considering location and the extras like indoor pool, complimentary breakfast, valet."
"From the moment we arrived at Homewood Suites downtown, the Valet was very accommodating making sure we were at the right Homewood and also making sure to let us know he would take care of us. The staff was very pleasant and helpful. The room had an amazing view of downtown! My two children were in awe from the moment we arrived. Our room was very clean and roomy, and my daughter was treated like a princess with the American Girl package that I booked! Breakfast was ok, and the dinner reception was very good. If there is anything bad I can say, it could be that the dining area could be a bit larger to accommodate everyone. There were people standing and eating. Other then that, everything else was simply perfect! Thank you Homewood for helping make a perfect and memorable spring break getaway, and for all your assistance in helping us figure out how to get around! Definitely will be back!"
"We stayed for 2 nights, one of them being a week night, so we had a great dinner that night. Breakfast was wonderful both mornings. The hotel was crowded, so there was some chaos at breakfast, but we worked thru it. The rooms were nice and we had lots of space even in the smaller room. We didn't cook, but having the kitchen came in handy. The pool was ok, and I really missed not having a hot tub. The staff was friendly, and very helpful. The location was perfect for spending time in downtown."
"My family of 5 was able to stay at an excellent rate each night in a Homewood Suites room with a glorious view of downtown Chicago. There was breakfast included every morning, dinner Monday-Thursday nights, full kitchens in every suite, courteous service from the staff, and a swimming pool on the 19th floor with lovely views. Starr Stovall who works the front desk has an award-winning personality and noted details that made me feel so very welcome. This hotel is in the BEST downtown visiting location! Everything is within about 4 miles. There is shopping, food, bars, and attractions galore within a moment's walking distance of the front door. Valet parking can be included in the nightly rate at a cheaper price if you get the special parking inclusive package. Don't drive while you are here. Take a cab. We found this to be the cheaper of the options for most local hot spots. Do: *Ask for a mattress foam topper if kids sleep on the hideaway sleeper sofa. *Save $ by eating breakfast. *Get a room ending in 13 or 15, or a corner room for a good size and best view. *Get a room on an upper floor for the best view. *Become or use the Hilton Honors program to rack up points for travel. Don't:*Take the subway over a cab to travel in downtown (especially if you are a bigger group.) The subway cost more for our family of 5 than the cab. *Expect the world's fastest elevators. I would recommend this hotel and will likely return the next time I visit Chicago."
"Stayed one night, good to fair room. The room was huge and fully equipped, it just seemed in need of a coat of paint. The pool is small and not very warm so the kids opted not to swim. Breakfast buffet was what most chains serve up these days. There were long lines to be seated and ran out of forks and plates. The one good thing was the beds. Both the pull out sofa and the king bed were super comfortable."
"An absolutely great place to stay. It starts with the valet parking and bags crew. A very welcome greeting, followed by efficient check in. The hotel staff is friendly and helpful. The rooms are clean and ready when you arrive. Special requests are always met. The twelve o'clock check out time eases stress. Dollar for dollar you would have a difficult time topping this place. We love it and visit at least 6 times a year."

"My family and I stayed at the Homewood Suites for the third (and final) time while attending an annual conference for my mother-in-law. This is our 14th year in a row traveling to Chicago and staying for the conference. We stay for a week each time soooo... that's two rooms for a week each. When we call to make the reservations we are directed to a central Homewood Suites department. When we asked to be placed in two adjoining rooms, we are consistently told ""Yes, we have marked your record and will make that happen"" but each time we are told that the reservations department is disconnected and they don't really know. To go further... last year we had an issue with this property, mainly a person checking us in who had a very bad and condescending attitude. We didn't understand why he was so unpleasant, each and every time we went to the front desk for anything whether it was change for the laundry, to buy something from the convenience shop or to ask a question about places to eat. This year was no different. We phoned the front desk when we were about 2 hours out asking if it was ok for us to check-in early since we were arriving earlier than the normal check-in. He said that it shouldn't be a problem but they couldn't guarantee it. We arrived and again it was Mr. Unfriendly (I am pretty sure his name is Rev or Michael... we had two cranky people this year). When we got there it was almost an immediate attitude towards us and he even said to my husband in a seriously rude tone ""We had this issue with you last year and I told you the same thing then""... when all my husband had said was... you said we may be able to check in a bit earlier if one of the rooms were ready and we were just wondering how much longer you thought it may be"" (paraphrased). He welcomed every single person checking in with ""Welcome back Mr. or Ms. so-and-so"" Not only did he not welcome us back but he was PO'd at us before we even walked in.A few days into our stay we had run out of clean towels (sick toddler - you do the math) and I had called the front desk in the evening for additional towels. An hour later, I called down and said that I could just come to the front desk and pick them up, it wasn't hard for me to do that. The same cranky guy was nasty and made some comment about being patient and the towels would arrive. When they did arrive a super friendly guy with what I suspect to be maintenance brought the towels and I told him about the situation with the cranky guy. He apologized profusely and said that it wasn't the first time someone had said he was rude to them and that it happens all the time. That same person came back to our room a few minutes later and said he couldn't find the hotel manager because he was going to tell him about the situation but he talked to the cranky guy and told him that he had offended us (again). He also brought us a few snacks and bottles of water. GREAT CUSTOMER SERVICE. Someone needs to speak with that guy at the front desk and require him to take customer service classes. He is the sole reason this property will be losing our business for all future visits... remember... that's two rooms for a week each for many years to come. I hope management is listening because the maintenance, housekeeping and door men are incredibly friendly but the two men (Rev & Michael) honestly need some hospitality training.

"Stayed at Homewood suites on business. Stayed in 4 different rooms over a month. My review is based on years of travel experience and i do pay attention to various things some might not.I think overall, this hotel is a decent option, especially for the price and location it offers. If price is not an issue, there are plenty of options around that i would say could be better. What i like:- hotel is part of Hilton, so you get your points- location is pretty decent- Front desk staff is friendly. check-in process takes about 5 min (if no line). One evening i flew in and was stuck in the office very late. I called, and they were very nice to inform me that my room is being held and they are expecting me.- the property offers free breakfast, which wasn't bad. Nothing fancy but had enough options every morning.- the rooms are spacious and offer the kitchen/fridge setup that might be usefull for family traveling and saving on restaurants. The bed is comfortable with plenty of pillows. TV had decent channel line-up. Free wi-fi was ok, not super fast, but workable.Not my favorite things:- The hotel tries to follow ""GREEN"" policy where if you leave the towel on the floor, they will exchange it for you. If not on the floor, they will leave it. I like this policy, unfortunately, the staff, who is nice, but didn't really follow that policy. They were exchanging any of my towels that were used but hanging.- As i was here during cold period, i actually used the thermostat/heater. Their system, in all the rooms i stayed, is just bad. It doesn't truly maintain the proper temperature. I don't want to get into many details here. The main thing, when it is cold in the morning you have to change a few degrees higher. Then it stops working in 15 min, and you have to do it again.- As it relates to above, the bathrooms do not have a heat element and are cold. So, you will need to warm up the room (where it will get really warm), just to have decent temperature in the bathroom.- The closet space is ok, but the shelf space is very limited in the room. If you are traveling as a family, might need to keep some stuff in the suit cases to have space.- Its been a long time since i have seen rooms with no in-room safe. This might be important to travelers. - the hotel still offers a smoking room, luckily on a dedicated smoking floors. My co-worker got a smoking room, 6 cans of air fresheners and 24 hours later, he still couldn't get the smell of smoke of his clothes.


Room Tip: If you are not a smoker, make sure that you request a non-smoking floor. Otherwise, you will regret...

Went on a business trip and stayed here for a little over a week. The room location was great with a view of the Lake and a 2 minute walk to Michigan Ave. Room was comfortable and clean. Hotel is quite large and there are a lot of amenities it has to offer. I normally prefer a smaller quieter hotel in the area. That is my only real disappointment is that it is too busy for me. Restaurant serves good food at hotel prices.
"I searched and searched and searched for a hotel in Chicago having never been. I came upon this hotel by accident as I was researching. I was very surprised and pleased with the value of the hotel. I had no idea what I had found until I arrived. The location is absolutely perfect with so many great things to do within walking distance. Another great surprise was the delicious complementary breakfast. This is not a Holiday Inn breakfast mind you. This is a full hot breakfast buffet. What really sold me on this hotel was the availability of having this suite. In the outer area, the sitting area, my son could stay up and watch TV late and I could go into the other room close the doors and go to bed early if I needed. This was a great set up for our family. I highly recommend this hotel and the next time I come back to Chicago, this is where I'll stay."
"My sister and I stay 3 nights annually to shop and enjoy the city. Awesome location across from Shops at North Bridge. It is surrounded by Eatily, Joe's, Shake Shack, and numerous shops and restaurants. We've never used the valet service, but the doormen are helpful, pleasant and knowledgeable about nearby offerings. The rooms are large and fully stocked; just a call to the front desk has always gotten us quick service with anything extra we need. The beds are SO comfortable! The bedding/bath towels look fresh and new. The housekeeping staff keep the rooms and common areas free of debris and are readily available. We have moved the dates of our annual trip to include more weekdays to take advantage of the complementary dinner. As another reviewer stated, the selection is pre-determined, but I've never been disappointed with the quantity or quality of the items I've eaten. (Certainly, it's a savings of well over $50 for my sister and I to use for shopping instead of eating!) Breakfast is also good to start our day. 4 stars instead of 5 are due to a couple of things: the pool needs a little more regular attention (floating debris the last time we tried swimming), the WiFi is spotty at best, and the rooms, while large enough, are in need of some updating. Carpet & kitchen cabinetry show signs of wear. Some re-grouting wouldn't hurt in the bathrooms, too. Thank you for a dependable place to call home when in Chicago!!"
"We stayed here Thanksgiving weekend to celebrate our 15 yrs together..We were surprised to find a nice bottle of wine, along with a nice note in the room on arrival. We were very impressed.. We found the staff helpful and pleasant.. Check-in was efficient. The rooms were spacious and very clean.. The bedding was extremely comfortable... Breakfast was crowded but with lots of choices. This property is in an excellent location for taking on Chicago by foot or public transportation. We would definitely stay here again.


Room Tip: City views from upper floors were great!

"Stayed here after a great stay at the Homewood Suites in Harrisburg.We took the Subway / L from Midway Airport so we didn't need to pay for parking.I was happy with my week long stay but there are few issues that we came across. Breakfast & Dinner were busy and at one point there was a wait. We adjusted our routine so that we came early to avoid the busy times. Elevator was also slow and busy every time we went to use it. Everything else was great. The bed & room was great size, WIFI was adequate, all the staff we spoke to were nice. Breakfast & Dinner had a nice varity."
"We stayed here this week and I must say, spend a little more and stay at the Embassy Suites. The rooms are much larger for more than two people. This room was very cramped, but we wanted to try a different Hilton this trip. The breakfast and dinner was average, the staff were very nice.The pull out bed in the very cramped living room was very uncomfortable. The dishes were dirty with lipstick stains on them in the cabinet. The king bed was very comfortable, love the pillows.

"The first impression at the ground Floor is somewhat mixed, as you have to take the lift to the 6 Th Floor for the reception. However the personel is very helpfull and the Suites are big with 2 Panasonic flatscreens, a full kitchen and place to work and relax.In the morning there is a free breakfast with varying composition of good quality and fresh ingredients. And there is a good strong coffee, quite exceptional in the US.The rooms are quiet and clean . At the reception drinks and even Bread can be bought, nice service when you are on business in a big city.On one evening I used the free dinner service with free drinks, even beer , and this appeared also of good quality and just what you need on a cold november night in Chicago.

"I went with a group and every time we need support from the crew of the front desk they were rude and careless with our problems.The reservation was wrong, they missed packages delivered and they don't pay attention to the guests.Location is good, rooms clean and concierge helps a lot. But the front desk is terrible. The space of the breakfast is also small for the size of the hotel.Next year I will come back but this hotel lost my group."
"The Homewood Suites is the place to stay if you are traveling as a family. They offer a full breakfast and dinner many nights. The meals are included for up to 4 in a room. The suites are small, a bit run down, but very comfortable. The staff couldn't be nicer. The location is very convenient to Michigan Avenue, walking to the river and lake and public transportation. The breakfasts were very good, offering lots of choices including hot and cold meal choices. However, due to the large number of families with kids there was a wait, or you had to bring food back to your room. The hotel is very quiet. My husband and I stayed at the Homewood Suites over Thanksgiving which might explain how crowded it was. If you are traveling as a couple, you might consider a different hotel that is a little less hectic, especially during holidays or school vacations.


Room Tip: Ask for a corner room on a higher floor away from the elevator.

"We stayed here recently for. Family Thanksgiving trip. Overall we were happy with the service and rooms. The rooms were definitely no frills, not as nice as some other extended stays that we have stayed at in Chicago, but the location is great. One issue that could be a deal breaker, though, was the breakfast and dinner service. The lines were horrible, which can be hard to deal with when small children are involved. We continued to have this problem no matter what time we tried to eat. Most of the time there was no place to sit and most food items were empty. Still up on the air as to whether we would stay again, as the good piece is very important to us with small children. With that being said, it was a holiday weekend and very busy."
"Little worn and dated interior, but comfy bed, and AMAZING Views of the downtown, Wrigley Building, Trump Tower. THREE big windows in the corner king suite of this building. From a person who is not from the city, this was a real treat, the views we had. Pretty quiet and no issues with it other than that the morning of the marathon, there was a strange noise that started around 8:30am. Very loud, like a plumbing or HVAC noise, don't know. We left right after that. If I had been sleeping in, I would've been mad, but we left, so I didn't care anymore. The location was great for the marathon, went right past the building. Included breakfast, hot, but nothing to write home about. I ate it anyway because I am always hungry :) Also, even with only having my mom and I on the trip, it is really nice to have the two room thing, so worth it! fridge, sink, separate room for tv or looking at city, etc. Location very very convenient. If you have money to spend, Joe's seafood/steak place on the corner, excellent! Also, I guess they have dinners during the week. we weren't there then so I can't vouch for it, but nice to have it offered.

"Got a good rate for my corner room and was very happy. Breakfast had many choices though I like just yogurt with fruit. The dinner that is included with your room Mon. -Thurs. was good and they had free wine and beer too. Came in handy to have dinner early when we had to get ready for the theater. The staff at this hotel is excellent.

"I only have positve notes for this hotel:-great room (we had a magnificent view from the 34th and 35th floor)-very clean, laundry service quick and not too pricey-breakfast absolutely satisfying-great staff (especially Nicole from the front desk- she was so friendly and kind and always eager to help!) -great location!!!

"It was a nice hotel in a place where you want to be located. Like a tiny 1 bedroom with a small full kitchen, large bathroom that's separated (sink outside the door). The furnishings were out of the 70s and both loveseat and chair were uncomfortable in the living room. Hard to bend around to see the TV, but being near everything it was nice to have a kitchen with tiny dining table. Lobby is on the 6th floor and the service is lacking. Not that bad, just not there."
"The location is perfect, in the heart of the city at walking distance from all the good stuff that Chicago offers.The room has good space, it is like an one bedroom apartment with a little kitchen and a living room.The windows are sound proof, you can't hear anything from the streets.The only reason for the four stars instead of five was the shower. The water doesn't come with much pressure, but I could live with that."
"I have not posted a reveiw on tripadvisor for some time but I felt compelled in this case. Everything about this hotel exceeded our expectations. All of the staff that we met were helpful and friendly, the room was spacious and very clean. Sure the furniture in the living area of the suite is a bit worn and dated but this is such a small thing in the overall scheme of things. Breakfast was plentiful and tasty, and we are well travelled and have stayed in many hotels over the years. The Managers reception on the weekday evenings was a very nice touch and appreciated. The pool was a welcome respite after a full day of walking and touring this wonderful city as it was extremely hot last week. It also has a wonderful view as it is on the nineteenth floor. The location is superb, basically within walking distance of just about everything that is a must see and do in Chicago. We are already looking forward to our next visit and would definitely stay at this great hotel again. I highly recommend.


Room Tip: We had a fantastic view from our room 1707.

"I just came back from my first visit to Chicago. Had no idea about location when making the hotel reservation, turned out it was right in the middle of it. Very centrally located footsteps away from Nordstrom Mall and other shops on Michigan avenue. There are tons of restaurants around to choose from.The hotel itself usually good since its a Hilton. Had some mixed up reservation issue upon checkin which was resolved immediately. The staff is very friendly and help.The rooms, I booked a suite, had a small kitchen area for selfcatering, with fridge, oven and microwave.The room maybe not huge, but still spacious enough. One thing some of the rooms allow smokers to stay at the hotel and smoke in the room. Of course they also offer non smoking floors.There is also a free breakfast buffet included, not a huge buffet, but enough basics to get started into the day.The hotel can easily be reach by train from Ohare airport and as I said before, everything is walking distance."
"Great hotel. Very close to everything in the downtown area. The managers reception serves beer and wine as well as dinner. I did not like the eggs at the complimentary breakfast (but I may be picky, others seemed to be enjoying them). The hotel staff was very friendly during check in and recommended things to do in the area. The conceriege was also very helpful and knowedgeable. They will help you choose a place to eat or call you a cab. They also provided very fast efficient service with our bags while they held them prior to our check in. The hotel is also secure. It requires a key after 11pm to use the elevator (to stop any non-guasts from coming into the hotel). I really appreciated this feature. The magnificant mile is only 1 block away. We walked to Shedd aquarium and it only took about 20 minutes. It's a nice walk. You walk through the sculpture park (the bean), by buckingham fountain, and along Chicago riverfront. If you stay here and are going to the aquarium I recommend walking one direction! Overall the hotel was a good experience!!"
"This hotel is located in the heart of downtown Chicago, literally on the same street as the entrance to Navy Pier, and it's about a 5 min walk or less to Michigan Ave and the start of the magnificent mile, no shortage of shops around the hotel. Not to mention the countless restaurants outside your doorstep. Although we didn't need a kitchenette, it was a nice feature. The free breakfast was also a nice touch. Parking is a bit expensive at the hotel but I was able to park at a public garage down the street for less than $10 a day. I reserved the spot via spothero.com, I'll recommend using this site for parking, even had in and out privileges!"
"Just spent two perfect nights in this wonderful hotel, Ideally situated near Michigan Avenue, Navy Pier, public transportation, everything. Rooms comfortable. Very good breakfast and full evening meal. Nice views from the indoor pool. Concierge on first floor very helpful, breakfast staff friendly and courteous. All in all an excellent stay. Would definitely return.

"The suites are better than average, comfortable beds and reliable cleaning service. Breakfast is also far superior than we had expected the only draw back of the hotel is the elevators. Only two and at peak times they are always full and constantly misfunctioning. Great location however and very friendly staff that gave us some good advice for getting around the city

"The best part of this hotel is the buffet...for breakfast and for dinner. Add that to the friendly service and excellent location and you have a wonderful travel experience. I stayed there for four weeks, and it never got old (except for the being away from home part). The breakfast staff knew me and on one occasion, reminded me to retrieve my newspaper before sitting down.


Room Tip: Ask for a corner suite with a view of Grand Ave. Nice (partial) view of the city.

"We live in Chicago and when we stay downtown it is usually splash out on getting away form the kids. This is not one of those places, but it is a great place for a more Unitarian stay. Excellent location, ample parking so you do not need to valet, ease access to the interstates and the rooms were amazingly clean and large. A surprise given the price, location and, generally, tourist clientele. I would definitely recommend as a place to stay downtown and have already recommended it to another person for a central family vacation homebase."
"The Homewood Suites on Grand is a solid choice for a hotel stay in Chicago. On the plus side: the rooms are comfortable, clean, quiet, and have plenty of space, the kitchenette is a great way to save money, the breakfast is free, and the gym and pool are nice. It doesn't get a five because the decor is dated, the property itself is pretty underwhelming aesthetically, the gym is small, and the breakfast is pretty bland. Regardless, the real selling point is the location. You're in the heart of much of what's great in Chicago - the lake, the parks, up and coming restaurants and easy access to the Red Line to head north to Wrigleyville, Lincoln Park, etc. I would stay here again.


Room Tip: The higher, the better, to be away from street level noise.

"This was my second time to stay at the Homewood Suites in Downtown Chicago. Pros: excellent location, free breakfast, free dinner Monday-Thursday with happy hour, free wifi and kitchenette included in the room. Cons: my room was on the 8th floor and smelled very smokey (7th floor is smoking floor), they only have 2 elevators and you can't take the stairs, so plan on spending 3-5 minutes waiting on an elevator every time you come or go.The gym is also nice, with a great view, but it only has 1 working treadmill (which was fine since I was usually the only person there). It also doesn't open until 6AM but the guard will open it sooner for you need it earlier.Overall a good hotel."
"Excellent location. It's just a few blocks west of Michigan Ave and a block from a red line station. Very comfortable two room suite with a full sized fridge, microwave, sink, coffee maker. Dishes are supplied and there is a dishwasher. A TV in each room. Wi fi was iffy, it would frequently drop. I think that's because we were at the far end of the hall. Breakfast was typical and very busy. Had to wait each morning for a table. Staff were universally friendly. Would stay here again."
"We stayed here for four nights and loved the location and view of our corner suite. The room was pretty clean and high quality surfaces were throughout. The cons of our stay included a loud group staying in an adjacent room. They were loud at 2 am and when we first stepped off the elevator I could smell marijuana in the hallway. Unsure at the time of the source of the aroma, I called security later that night when the smell never dissipated. Security acted on my call and checked several rooms, even removing someone from that adjoining room. I would still recommend staying here, just watch as elevator wait times can be 15+ minutes in the morning. Breakfast was ok, nice to eat something before heading out."
"I've stayed at Homewood Suites in other cities before and was looking forward to the fantastic breakfasts. Unfortunately, we did not find that in this location though. The cooked food was pretty tasteless, there was no mixed fruit, no ""adult"" cereal (other than porridge) and the dining room was about half the size it needed to be. Consequently, there was a crowd almost every morning during our 9 day stay. Many people took their meals up to their rooms.The bright spot was Alejandro, who took pity on us and got us a box of Raisin Bran. Thank you, Alex. The room was fine, as were the fitness center and pool. With this stay, I have spent all of my HHonors points, and since I've only made silver level the last couple of years, I no longer have much incentive to stay at Hilton brands, after a decade of enjoying gold and diamond level."
"Pro's - location, free breakfast, free dinner Mon-Thu, kitchen in room, staff.Con's - dated worn out furniture, too many stains on walls/carpets/furniture, chlorine to the max pool, free breakfast.Only a couple of blocks from Michigan Ave (but you do have to learn how to navigate or you'll walk right under it), river and a nice walk to Navy Pier. The rooms are in need of a renovation as they are a bit dark and the furniture is dated and worn out. Not hard to find stains and discoloration. Nice to have a breakfast but fresh cut fruit is rare and few real healthy choices. Often if you are too early some of it is cold as it needs to heat up in the hot trays (or it sat too long before coming out). Eggs are overcooked before they are served. They do seem to try.At times it just seems that the hotel manager is trying to maximize profit through savings vs. through customers. Stains on hallway carpets should never happen as someone should be patrolling the halls every few hours and bringing out the carpet machine as soon as an issue is found (or treat until morning so folks can sleep). The silverware and dishes are often stained with either food or cheap detergent. The continually run out of trays for bringing food back to the room. Should never happen. Over chlorinated pools are often due to not monitoring them frequently as it buys time. We received a towel so frayed it was laughable. The wifi is embarrassing as it doesn't reach the entire hotel. Who's idea was that? You may need to be close to your door to keep from dropping off. It's a lot of little things that can lead folks to not return. Those with kids will due to the breakfast/dinner but if you are looking for a bright modern room where you are made to feel really cared for, this place isn't it. Also they don't care if you are a HHonors member and what should be provided to your level. If you need to have the food and don't mind a worn out place where they do try, you'll be happy.


Room Tip: All rooms are pretty quite.

"It is hard to find anything good to say about this hotel except to warn you not to stay here. From the worn, dirty furniture in the lobby to mold in the bathroom to the sloppy service, almost any place has to be better. The suite we got was supposed to accommodate 4 adults but the living area was too small to pull out the sleeper sofa without putting a chair in front of the kitchenette counter and climbing in form the edge. There are many other options nearby like the Embassy Suites that are far nicer and the same price. If you decide to ignore my caution and book a room here, be prepared to pay $55 a night for parking and slow internet access. Trust me, there are many, many better places to stay when you are in downtown Chicago."
"We just got back from Chicago and stayed at Homewood. I like the rooms because you have a full kitchen & its nice to have a living room also. The rooms are clean but kind of dated. They do give you a free breakfast every morning. What I did not like was the service we received. They are not very polite at the front desk & the first day there they did not clean the room. When we came back at 6:00pm I called the front desk & told them it had not been cleaned. They stated that housekeeping was already gone for the day, which I have never heard of at any of the other Hilton affiliates I have stayed at before. They where rude & acted like I was inconveniencing them but they did bring us some clean towels. I will not stay there again just because of the people that run the hotel."
"We stayed here for 4 nights as part of our family holiday in the US. I've got to say that for us it gave us everything we needed.It's location is 1 block from N. Michigan Ave (Magnificient Mile) and a short walk to Navy Pier and close to the river. There were lots of good places to eat locally as well.The Suite was clean and reasonably well presented. There were four of us staying in the suite (2 x Adults & 2 x teenage children). We (the adults) chose to sleep on the pull out bed in the sitting room. This we decided would be easier as we would probably be up before our children. This proved to be the case everyday and allowed us then to use the kitchen to make coffee etc without interruption to the children. At first we felt the suite was a little small but I guess as we got used to it we grew to feel it was okay. However, everything in the suite was geared for 3 people. Three mugs, three bowls, three plates and three bath towels. This would seem odd as the room had been booked for four people. The towel situation was resolved in minutes by a quick call to reception. They had the towels brought up in less than 5 minutes.The room was cleaned daily and appeared to be cleaned well.Breakfast was included in the charge but we never used this option. We tried on the first day and the queue was so long we gave up and went out for breakfast instead. We then bought our own breakfast stuff and had it in our room for the following days.The hotel is clearly not designed for catering and I wouldn't consider this location if you were not looking to dine out every night. As mentioned previously there are many very good places to eat very locally.All the staff seemed attentive and appeared to care. We enjoyed our stay here (partly because we love Chicago) and would recommend the Homewood Suites."
"We choose this hotel for the suite rooms with kitchenettes and its great location to public transportation,sightseeing, grocery stores (Jewel-Osco, Trader Joe's, Eataly) and shopping. It definitely was a very good choice for all these things. The hotel is on Grand Ave. in downtown Chicago in the River North area. We were able to get from O' Hara airport fairly easily by taking the Blue Line Train to the Clark/Lake stop and then taking a short cab ride the rest of the way to the hotel. We bought Ventra cards with one week passes loaded onto them the first day we arrived and used them on the buses and trains all week to visit all the sights in Chicago. There is a very close bus stop from Homewood on Michigan Ave. that takes about 5 minutes to walk to by turning right out of the hotel and then taking a right turn on the first street, Wabash, and another right on Ohio St. until you get to Michigan Ave. Most any bus you may need stops at this bus stop on the corner. Michigan Avenue is also known as the Magnificent Mile because the street is lined with wonderful stores. Bus 151 runs up and down Michigan Ave. and you can catch other buses to all the museums, Millennium Park and State Street for shopping and the Chicago Theatre district from this stop as well. The free trolley for Navy Pier stops a few feet from the hotel on Grand Ave...go left out of the hotel and the stop is right before Rush which is the first street to the left. The red line train to Wrigley Field is also one block from the hotel on State Street. Our hotel room suite was extremely clean. We requested a room on the upper floors on the south side of the building because this side has the best views. We weren't able to check in until 4pm and did have to wait awhile until our room was ready. Since our original room wasn't ready (a king studio) by 4 and the room wasn't with the view we wanted, the clerk gave us a different room with a separate bedroom and a great south side view..so it worked out great! The room has a nice larger bathroom and the kitchen was also very nice...except for lacking a few items for cooking (large bowl and colander). The breakfast choices were good, and they were a little different each day. We thought the hostesses in the dining room were very welcoming and friendly towards the guests. I was not as equally impressed with the front desk clerks, who I thought were not especially helpful with directions etc. They do have a smart board right by the front desk to use for information on Chicago, sights, etc. The hotel has a complimentary evening meal each night from 5 to 7 on Monday through Thursday. The meals were just okay...I did not especially like the choices for the main dish, but they do have a very nice salad available each night, with cut up veggies, and they even include a dessert and wine with your meal.We did not use the pool or fitness center but they both looked very nice. They are on the top floor of the hotel. There are washers and dryers available in a very small room on the 7th floor. There is also a very large business center room with anything you might need (three computers, printer, fax, supplies). The only negative about the hotel was a minor one...we didn't always get the number of towels (wash cloths especially and kitchen towels) we needed. You honestly can't pick a better location to stay in while visiting Chicago. We had a wonderful time on our first visit to the Windy City!

"Great location. As travelers of various Homewood Suites venues this lines up with what we expect a Homewood property. Even though we were near the elevator, the noise levels were great and we had great sleep. Close to Eataly, shopping, Chicago Trolley stops,Pool was great (excellent views, great temperature). Kid friendly heights (3.5 feet in shallow end)Valet service and bellman service with our luggage was spot on. Elevators were slow (only 2) so we used the stairs when we could (to get to breakfast/dinner). We were on the 9th floor so we would take the stairs instead. We even took it to the ground floor a few times during busy times. One minor issue was breakfast was extremely busy and certain things like milk, waffle batter not being restocked in a timely manner.

"On the hottest day in Chicago all summer, I received a greeting that was colder than the coldest day in January. The reception desk staff were unfriendly and cold. This was the worst greeting that I experienced in all of my travels for quite a while.The hotel also managed to ""overbook"" because a group did not leave. This caused one member of our party to be sent to another hotel. The other problem was that they had charged my credit card for the entire stay even before I showed up. This also has never happened to me in how much I travel.The hotel itself is well maintained and very well appointed. It is too bad that the staff did not make this a pleasant stay."
We stayed here for one night before we left Chicago. Breakfast and nightly reception was a great value. The location was great because you can walk to Michigan Ave in a couple minutes to shop and dine. The we had a one bedrooms suite with Kitchen which was perfect for two adults and two children. Plus my boys loved the top floor swimming pool and my husband enjoyed the gym. It was a great hotel for a family and would stay here again.

"Our family stayed here mid July and had a nice stay. Pros- the location. It is one block from the red line and bus stop. Staff is friendly and hardworking(especially the bell service). Free breakfast was a nice treat. Rooms were large and clean. The pool is indoors and on the top floor. Also nice fitness center with a great view. Cons- elevators were slow and to few. There were only 2 and one was not working. The first day it was so crowed that we had to carry our suitcases down 6 flights of stairs to the bell desk because our room wasn't ready. When your on vacation, the last thing you want to do is spend extra time waiting for an elevator.Overall it was a great stay. We would have given it 5 stars, but for the elevators."
"I enjoy staying here for our ""stay-cations"", or for our once a month ""date night"". The rooms are very clean and well-kept. The breakfast is absolutely wonderful and the service staff there are all so friendly and attentive. The location is so convenient for when we want to walk to the Gold Coast and do some window browsing. I always ask for a high floors for the wonderful Chicago views, especially at night. I haven't tried the pool lately, so I can't comment on that. All in all, I recommend this hotel for couples.


Room Tip: Higher floors for the quietness and beautiful night view of the city.

"We traveled as a family of 5 to the great city of Chicago, approximately 4.5 hour drive from Detroit.We book the hotel on-line and when we arrive, checked in, but had to wait until 4 pm for our keys. We ventured into the city and walked to Navy Pier had lunch and went on an architectural tour of the city by boat. What a great and informative boat ride.Walking back to the hotel, we came across a Store / Restaurants called Eataly. WOW, food to purchase from all over Italy and 20 stations of made to order food. Wood buying pizza ovens, bakery, cheese are, deli, beer bar, wine bar, gelato, cappuccino bar, fresh pasta, and made to order crepes etc. This place is a must see. A blend of culinary delights to take home and to share and eat right in the store / restaurant! Brilliant idea.Back at the hotel, we were spoiled with a king bed suite. What a pleasure to unwind in our ""space"" before venturing out for dinner. The kids also had there own room just down the hall and that was very convenient as well. The lobby was located on the 6th floor and the hotel above that. We parked the car and walked everywhere and a few times took a cab.This hotel is perfectly located in the centre of the action and was awesome. We will stay here again and look forward to the excellent service we received while there!"
"Location was great, just a couple of minutes walk to Michigan Ave. Close to all the transportation options to get you anywhere you needed to go. Several good places to eat are nearby. The hotel rooms are nice and comfortable, well kept. Ground floor staff was very good, greeted us and informed us of where we need to go for check in and were always there to direct us to our destination or get a taxi service for us. Breakfast staff were very accomodating even quickly opened an extra dining area when the main area was full. We traveled with freinds and family, our group consisted of 4 adults and 5 children under 10, they all did a great job of accomodating all our needs."
"The front staff is friendly as well as the check in staff. I was appalled at the rudeness of the lady running breakfast. She was very rude and not inviting in any way. I saw her talking to some of the younger ladies working during breakfast in a snotty manner, and talking to them like they were below her. I felt terrible for them! The area around the pool was dirty with hair that had not been cleaned up in 3 desperate days I had been there. The window in the living room area had a wad of gum stuck to it. Beautiful views!!!"
"Great central downtown location and good price. Rooms were pretty good too. But when i stayed here there was construction on the ground level and all there was at the ground floor were elavators, took me a bit to figure out that i had to go up to a different floor where the reception was. Felt like some unfinished apt complex. Doesn't feel pleasant to stay where you have to go through the ground floor construction just to get to the lobby, much less your room."
"I was traveling with a group of friends and we stayed at the Homewood Suites in downtown Chicago. It truly was a wonderful stay! The friendliness and helpfulness of the staff was amazing! Alex and Michael at the front desk helped us figure out how to navigate Chicago and were so helpful in making sure we were able to go where we wanted in the best possible way. It was obvious that their goal is to make their guests feel comfortable, welcome, and at home. They definitely succeed and excel at this!The other benefits of staying here are the location of the hotel and included dinner Monday through Thursday. The hotel is so close to many of the attractions and transportation. The Red Line subway is only about a half block away! The food at both breakfast and dinner was great! The dining workers were also very accomodating and friendly!Overall, I was very impressed and plan to stay here again the next time I visit Chicago!"
"This hotel is located right in the heart of Chicago city, a block (1 minute away) away from the famous Michigan avenue and the subway. Our room was very clean and large to accommodate 2 adults and 2 children. Our room had a nice view and was quiet. The bed was very comfortable. Everyone woke up well rested and refreshed. The living room was spacey and had a working utilitarian kitchenette. The room came with a large screen LCD TV. Breakfast was expressed as ""delicious"" by my picky daughter. We particularly enjoyed the taste of fresh coffee which came in three blends (bold, regular, decaf) and fresh fruits. A great bonus was the availability of dinner-like meals in weekdays which our children really liked. The staff was very cordial and helpful. We utterly enjoyed our stay in this hotel and will definitely book again. Bottomline, this is the place to stay if you have kids and need a place in Chicago downtown at a bargain price."
"From the moment we pull up we were treated as royalty, Sal, Amir, Sammy, Demetri and Allen was like sunshine they cater to our every move wouldn't allow us to lift a finger. Hotel staff was very competent and knowledgeable about the area and made you feel like family. Star Stovell was excellent my daughter and myself drove 12 hours to get there didn't realize there was a time change so we were early and tired. Star got us checked in without drama and was very friendly. Star called downstairs for our luggage by the time we got to the room there was a knock on the door WOW! Allen was there with our belonging with that wonderful smile and eager to please. I had to room 704 and 1004 my sister checked in the next day same service was giving. Marcus I call him big guy with the beautiful eyes manager and was very knowledgeable and friendly joked around with us and made us feel like we belonged there, We were greeted every time we traveled in or out. The rooms can use a lot of updating the beds were great. The quality of service we received was worth it but please update the decor and loose the the dirty carpet. The Breakfast and dinner was a nice touch Ivan the cook is Excellent and the whole cooking staff thanks cookie man for the delicious cookies. The whole staff was great can't remember every ones name. but we had a wonderful stay and very grateful for all of you. Close to most of the attractions will definitely stay again.

"We recently stayed here with 2 toddlers. Given that it is smack in the middle of downtown, we expected the rooms to be on the smaller side, which they were. Also a little old. But perfectly clean, comfortable, and met all of our needs. The buffet breakfast was terrific, the hotel staff was exceptionally friendly, and location was fantastic. All in all, a great choice and we would stay again without hesitation."
"Was here for a business meeting for three days. A very well trained and friendly staff made a very positive impression to all. The conference staff really did a great job and were very responsive to our every request. The valet staff was especially great. A good group of guys that were friendly, fast and efficient. Although this might not be a big conference hotel, we chose it due to it's great location. We are going back in one month."
"The location of this hotel was perfect. Right next to Magnificent Mile, and just a 2 min walk from the CTA Red line. The hotel itself though is just mediocre. Nothing was really bad about it, but nothing was great. Simply middle of the road. They advertise free breakfast which was okay, but I've seen better at other suite-style Hilton properties. The free dinner was terrible and very much a ""get what you pay for"" experience. Ignore the free dinner if your budget allows since there other choices abound in the areas surrounding the hotel. As for the room, it was clean and good-sized, but so many little things kept it from being great. The phones didn't work. There is no wired internet access on any floor except 15, no room service, the door to the bedroom was physically cracked and I had to request that someone come fix it (to their credit, they did so quickly), The TVs are average size, but picture quality is terrible, our bedroom closet door was very janky and kept falling off the tracks, no fan in the bathroom. On the plus side the room had very dark shades for a comfortable rest, and the bed was comfortable. It was also nice to have a dishwasher with dishes stocked in the cupboards. The staff was mostly friendly with a few minor exceptions. So overall a decent hotel, but not what I expected for the price or the Hilton brand."
"A very good place to stay. Very conveniently located.....only a few blocks from Michigan Ave., Navy Pier and train line. The suites are large and fully equipped. An enclosed pool is available on the 19th floor. A complementary all you can eat breakfast is offered every day and a light all you can eat dinner Mon. - Fri.( unlimited wine and beer are on the night buffet). A great place if you are traveling with children. Would definitely stay here again."
This was my first stay in a Homewood Suites and I highly recommend this location. The hotel is located just 2 blocks from Michigan Ave and 3 blocks from the river. The Studio suites are comfortable enough for a couple and I love that the windows actually open for some fresh air . Didn't really take part in the free breakfast/ dinner as you are surrounded by great Chicago food options. Staff was wonderful and look forward to a future return.
"Only great comments here. Great choice on our part. Comfortable beds, nice large rooms, great air conditioning, in-door pool on the 19th floor, refrigerator, microwave, cooktop, coffee pot, coffee, tea, ice maker in refrigerator, 2 flat screen tvs, large bathroom, free breakfast, you can bring up to your room, free evening meals you can bring up to your room, including free wines and free beer, and free refills. Great value for families with several children. Hotel is only 2 blocks from the Magnificent Mile, walking distance to the Navy Pier, and walking distance to either the brown line or red line. 1 street over from Rush St. Where you find many pubs and taverns, not to mention the bar & grills across the street from hotel."
"There are some great things about the hotel and some not so great. I was there for work for a week and the first room assigned to me was right across the elevator. I'm typically ok with whatever room assigned, but considering I'm 28 weeks pregnant and already facing issues falling asleep I asked to get a different room after trying to take s nap and not being able to because I hear every beep that came from the elevator. The guy at the desk made a funky face when I asked and then called the house keeping manager to tell him there will be one more room to clean because I was getting moved and then said ""because the elevator is there"" with an attitude to the other guy on the line and hung up. Luckily I did get assigned a different room and hurried to get my things out. In the midst of it all, I left a dress in the room. The next day I asked the front desk about the dress and the lady said she'll take note of it and if found they will put it in my room. Well I haven't heard anything at all nor was my dress returned, so not a happy camper there. Other than that, the breakfast is good and the guys on the first floor are really friendly, however not that great of an experience to where I would want to return. There's too many other hotels in the area that I would prefer to give a chance."
"Just returned from a quick trip to Chicago and loved our stay at the Homewood Suites. Very convenient to the Red Line to catch a Cubs game, great restaurants, the magnificent mile and many Chicago attractions. Great breakfast! Super friendly and helpful staff! Great to have a kitchen, even though we only used the fridge. Yes, furniture is a little worn and the pullout couch needs more padding, but we would all definitely stay again--and in big part due to how accommodating and pleasant every staff member was--from the minute we pulled up!"
"For the price, location and breakfast and dinners!!! it was the best. A 2-room suite, 2 TV's, nice people, close to Navy Pier. We walked just about everywhere. We got Go Chicago card- 5-day pass and saved at least $200. Got 2-day hop-on- Hop-off and 3 boat rides with card.Entered places even though lines with card. This hotel is so centrally located that other than one taxi ride home from a play and a bus trip- walked everywhere- and I am not a walker! (age 68) From airport took red line and got off a block from hotel- on their street- Grand St. Best city I ever went to. Favoritwe building TRUMP. You must go!"
"The staff members were extremely nice! The beds were comfortable, however, the pull out sofa wasn't acceptable. The sofa and chair were very old, dirty, and uncomfortable. The carpet was actually damp in some places and had a mildew smell. The hot breakfast was excellent but on the weekends, I feel like a 7:00 am start time is too late; 6:00 am would be more appropriate. The location is great but I don't plan on staying at this property again while in Chicago."
"Yes, the rugs are scuffed, but for this business traveler who likes to do her own real cooking, it was awesome. Full refrigerator, knives that cut, stovetop, plates, bowls, even a couple of microwave cooking dishes. One block from a Trader Joes and less from Eataly. The atmosphere in the elevator/dining room/halls was like family camp, kids running everywhere, the staff very helpful. The rooms completely quiet, the views out the window of the neighboring skyscrapers uplifting. Neighborhood is in central downtown near Michigan Ave shopping strip, but it doesn't feel noisy or oppressive. Lovely to have a separate bedroom and a decent-sized living room and kitchen too. Business ctr. for printing out boarding passes. Could have used a desk, but can't have everything. Check in is on the 6th floor. I passed on the meals, they looked like camp food. Not glamorous, but a nice place to hang and met my needs perfectly. Check out the Millennium Park at the Art Institute while you're there. I used Uber to get around and loved it."
"Came into town for a short stay (three nights) but the kitchen came in handy. Traveling with four kids (under 10) can have it's challenges but the pool and ""roomy"" room made it that much easier. The staff were Wonderful. Sal was a great asset. He always made sure we were pointed in the right direction, was a wealth of knowledge and made our family feel welcome. We all enjoyed a plentyful breakfast before heading out for the day. The location was perfect. Lots of great shopping and dining within walking distance. The train was near by as well. Wouldn't think of staying anywhere else."
"The hotel is clean and in the heart of downtown....close to everything. They offer a complimentary breakfast which was below average. They had a waffle bar which was awesome, but the eggs, sausage, potatoes, and other options were subpar. I was also disappointed they didn't offer complimentary wi-fi...or at the very least ethernet ports in the rooms. I consider that a must in this day and age. The staff were extremely friendly and helpful."
"Seriously. I LOVE that the bedroom is separate from the living/sitting room (TVs in each, what a nice amenity). Wonderful king size bed. Fully equipped kitchen including dishwasher. BIG living space. Good free breakfast; excellent service, especially the valet car service. Within walking distance of Art Institute, The Egg, Millenium Park, the Magnificent Mile--truly outstanding experience, especially for the price."
"Recently enjoyed a 3 night stay with friends from Canada for a Chicago City Tour.

"My husband and I do not travel a lot as we find the experience often stressful. Our stay at the Downtown Chicago Homewood Suites just might change that. I am going to start with the staff . . . friendly and helpful best describes each and every staff person I came in contact with. There was never a problem with transportation as the doorman had a cab ready for us in the morning and offered advice on the El when we asked. As for amenities . . . nothing beats a hot breakfast every morning before a day of shopping and sightseeing. The location of this hotel is perfect! We walked to the Navy Pier and all over Michigan Avenue. The rooms were clean, if a bit dated, and quiet. I felt like we were the only ones in the hotel thought we often saw other people near the elevators and of course at breakfast. All in all, a fantastic choice for anyone thinking of staying in Chicago."
"This is our 4th time staying at the Homewood Suites in downtown Chicago. It's not because we have to but because we just can't imagine ourselves spending a week anywhere else when there. For the last four years I have attended week-long business training in the city and I always bring my family along to enjoy the city as well.From a business and family perspective, the hotel is full of every convenience you could possibly need. *Unlimited coffee, tea, and hot chocolate at your service 24/7. I felt really taken care of when every day I could count on a GOOD coffee with french vanilla creamer whenever I wanted. There were a few times that the urn was out or cold, but if told the staff wouldn't hesitate to correct that.*The daily hot breakfast buffet is a great added value that let's you have that homecooked meal and get out as quickly as you need to. They change it up each day too, between turkey bacon or sausage, eggs or buscuits and gravy, or some other various breakfast selections. No matter what the rotation is, you can always count on the cook-your-own waffle station, toast station, and vanilla yogurt with all of the toppings.*The location just one block off of Michigan Ave is convenient to everything. Even on foot I can access Oak Street Beach on the north end of Mag Mile or Grant Park on the south end without much trouble. Surrounded by restaurants, shops, and fun sightseeing, the location of the hotel is perfect.*The nightly themed buffet dinners in the weekday evenings is a unique touch. The dinners can include anything from hot dogs and hamburgers, to meatball subs, to stuffed peppers, and so much more. Each evening usually includes a main entree and sides as well as salad and cookies or pastries. There is also tea, water, or lemonade available to drink as well as unlimited beer and wine. This greatly helps with the family budget while still allowing us to get out and have dinner on the town on the evenings we want to or if we didn't prefer what was being served.*The clean indoor pool room on the 19th floor with a view is great for both kids and parents. It is rarely busy so we never have a problem grabbing a lounge chair or a table while watching the kids swim. I love being surrounded by windows on 3 sides and it's just a great place to relax and read or even work out in the workout room with the kids still in sight.*The friendly staff makes you feel welcome every day, whether it be in the lobby by the food service employees and management or down on the first floor by the valet attendants. If there is anything you need they won't hesitate to help you out. We specifically enjoy seeing those who are working the breakfast and dinner service. They are amazing and remember everybody, they just take that little extra step to make you feel welcome.*The rooms are fit for a king. While they aren't over the top modern, every room is a suite and is decorated very warmly with separate bedroom; living room with large tv, sleeper sofa, and chair; and a full kitchen with granite countertops, full-size refrigerator, stove, and dishwasher. The television channel selection is great and the maid staff really takes care of you. They washed our dirty dishes in the dishwasher each day, made the sleeper sofa bed and decorated it with my daughter's stuffed animals, folded my other daughter's blanket, and always left fresh towels and toiletries as we needed them. The only complaint here was that if we were in the room when they came by around noon, they never came back later to clean the room so on those days it did not get cleaned."
"I stayed at the Homewood Suites on a recent stay in Chicago. I really had no major complaints. The room was very clean, the beds comfortable, the breakfast area was large and the breakfast choices were excellent. The location was excellent and the people who ran the valet parking were nice and efficient. All that said however, because it is a great value for families, it was full of kids. Now that is not bad in and of itself, but if you are looking for a quiet spot, this might not be your #1 choice. Additionally, because it was directly above the Weber Grill restaurant, the hallways smelled of grilled food. I did not notice this in the rooms at all, just more in the common areas. While I did not stay there, I did notice a Hilton Garden in about a block away, that looked equally nice but just a bit newer and at least from the looks of the common areas it was much quieter. Again, its personal preference. I generally like and recommend both properties, but consider what you are looking for before making a final choice!"
"We stayed at the Homewood Suites in Chicago again last weekend for a business and family trip. We are regulars. The location is fantastic, right by the red line El stop and within walking distance of many excellent restaurants and attractions. The beds are comfortable. The staff is also consistently friendly and helpful. I generally walk two blocks to Starbucks since I am a coffee snob, but having a decent breakfast provided helps when one has to head off early to a meeting."
"Suites can vary a bit in size, but my room was large (and clean). The hotel is in a good location within walking distance to a lot, especially shopping. Plus,supermarkets are right around the corner if you need food for the kitchen in the suite. And as another reviewer mentioned, Eataly Marketplace is essentially in the same building, though you do need to go around the corner to the entranceThe cost seemed like a good value overall. Didn't strike me as overly expensive given location and free breakfasts.Taxi cab stand very near front door, so easy to get rides immediately."
Quiet and convenient location a block from Michigan Ave. The suite we were assigned was in a corner - cuts off space. Likely the room available for the rate but it was smaller than others we saw in the building. Barely enough room to open the pull out couch. Cozy for three people. Breakfast was marginal - hot food had sat too long and was dry and unappealing - stick with cold food and the waffle station.
"This is an average homewood suites. Location is really key and why people stay here. It is in downtown chicago (streeterville), close to the ""L"" Grand station on the red line, also near lots of shopping and standard downtown restaurants. It is located in the same building as the Eataly marketplace (for foodies).Suites are on the smaller side, but then again it is an urban hotel. Standard amenities with refrigerator, dishwasher, etc in small kitchenette. Wi-fi is standard, a bit on the slower side. We were attending a convention so this was part of the convention hotels - and they seemed to do a lot of this business.Breakfast was disappointing - not as good as other homewood suites we have been to. often the food was overcooked or seemed as if they did not refresh it as much. The crowds were busy for breakfast. The two evenings there was a manager reception also had disappointing food; clearly we've been to other homewood suites with better food selection.Did not use the hotel staff/service much but seemed ok; they had a lot of guests and very busy so didn't feel as if service needed to be the priority given the large volume of guests. Views were great from the hotel rooms due to its location. We did not use parking or any other amenities on staff. It is $55/night for parking though.You can taxi or take the L to pretty much most places people need to be.If needed to go to another convention , probably would stay again .. but if had more choices of location would probably stay further out."
"First, I must apologize for the review is late. I wanted to go Chicago fior my 50th birthday and I wanted a hotel in the downtown area. I was blessed when I got this booking and Scott Kong FOM was great and gave great details for arriving at Midway airport to HM Suites.The staff at this hotel were very helpful and were courteous. The comment to the staff and the front desk to the valet parking staff. I will definitely be back to stay at this hotel to visit the beautiflul city of Chicago."
"I booked this hotel as it was the best value for money for a hotel close to Michigan Avenue. Taxi from O'Hare cost about $45 including tip. We got the best rate directly through their website. Stayed for 4 nights and had a room on 15th Floor. We had a corner room which was great, view of the skyline was magnificent. The room had a sitting room and kitchen with a couch and a one seater sofa. Full fridge, cooker, dishwasher, sink, cutlery etc. The bedroom was separate with plenty of storage. Vanity unit with sink was separate from the bathroom which was handy. Could not fault the room. Hairdryer, iron and ironing board. Staff were friendly and room was cleaned every day. The lobby is on the 6th floor so on arrival take the lift to the 6th floor. It was my husbands birthday and they had a cake and a card in the room when we arrived - nice touch! Breakfast wasn't great but was run well. If the breakfast room was full you waited outside and your room number and number of guests was taken, you were then called to a table when one was free - much better than trying to grab a table. There was tea and coffee on offer outside the breakfast room (and all day) while you were waiting also which was great. The food wasn't so good, I had stayed in a Homewood Suites in Orlando and the breakfast was better with more choices. There were scramble eggs, sausages, toast, cereal, muffins, bagels - cream cheese, jams. I suppose for the rate you pay it isn't bad. Wifi is free and works well. TV channels are good with plenty of films etc. Proximity to Miracle mile - 2 minute walk, Navy Pier - 15 minute walk, Millennium Park - 15 minute walk so great central base. Would definitely recommend this hotel, you don't spend much time in your hotel so why pay more!"
"Many family members stayed here for a wedding. Efforts were made to group families together. Most stayed on the 16th floor. Extremely minimal traffic noise, but you can't escape those sirens in the middle of the night. Enter off E Grand and you'll have to take the elevator to the 6th floor to Register. This is also the location of the morning breakfast bar, which is fairly standard, eggs, sausage, potatoes of some sort, pastries, mini waffles (the kids around us seemed to really like these - topped with various toppings). The coffee in the lobby area ran out several times. The location of the coffee in the breakfast area is really tight and those that feels so inclined to doctor their coffee in front of the pots really hold up the line. LOCATION AND STAFF OUTSTANDING !! Front desk staff (checking in and out) were great and the morning breakfast staff were extremely friendly and helpful!The exercise room on the 19th floor is next to the indoor pool, with glass all around. Great view for a quick workout. Precor machines plus free weights. A bicycle and a couple treadmills. Every restaurant you can think of is within blocks. PF Changs and Weber Grill (excellent French Onion burger), UNO and California Pizza, along with a local brewery is on the corner. The Chicago Harley Davidson store is behind the hotel. The Red Line is on the corner of E Grand and State (1 block from the hotel). Very convenient to take to a White Sox game. Drops you out across the street from the stadium. Round trip is $2.25.I would definitely stay here again for all the reasons stated, but I can't over emphasize the great location (Nordstroms Mall with a food court on the 4th floor across the street).

"If you are visiting Chicago for a Business or Pleasure trip, this is a great place to stay. This is located right in the heart of city - 2 blocks away from - The Magnificent Mile' with great views of the Downtown. The staff here are very friendly and great amenities. They offer both smoking and non-smoking rooms. They have free wifi connectivity in all the rooms. The breakfast menu is really good. Their 24 hr store that has basic needs (that you often tend to miss) is of great use. There are lot of restaurants, bars and clubs within the waking distance from this hotel."

Have been going to this hotel once a year for many years and the week stay has always been enjoyable. The hotel staff does a great job to accommodate your needs and we have always found the location superb. You are close to everything in downtown Chicago. This stay we met the evening manager and he went out of his way to help us enjoy our visit. When sitting in the lobby he would often come over to see how our day went and offer suggestions on what to see in Chicago. We had to leave earlier than anticipated and he made a point of coming over to thank us for staying and wish us a safe trip home. We are looking forward to our week visit in 2014.
"Had a 3 night visit for pleasure with my 7 year old granddaughter. Everything from the doormen (so attentive and helpful), the staff, the kitchen workers, front desk, housekeeping were all so friendly and welcoming. The first night of our stay our room was a little warm, I brought it up to the front desk and told her no hurry and there was someone up to take care of it within 20 minutes. The roof top (enclosed) swimming pool with its wonderful views was a complete hit, my granddaughter loved it and had a blast. It was very clean and not over crowded. Our room was very welcoming and clean. We had an amazing trip and HomeWood made it the icing on the cake.


Room Tip: We had an upper floor room, highly recommended for a Chicago stay.

"Stayed here for 3 nights with family. I could not have asked for a better stay. I would definately stay here again if I returned to Chicago.Serive: Fantastic! Everyone from the front door men always being there with the door to the check in desk. Speciall shout out to Connie who worked the breakfast dining room. She was everything you would want in a hotel employee: Friendly, personable, and hard working. She remember us every morning and even commented that we were a little later than usual the 3 day when we slept in.Location: Ideal in Chicago. Close to the subway, a short walk to Navy Pier. Lots of great resturants and shopping near by.Rooms: Nice suite that was clean and confortable. The only negative, if I were being picky, is the fact that we couldn't get a cot for our 2nd daughter to sleep on.

"It started out a little rough. I was ""E-checked in"" upon my morning arrival. I notified the front desk I was here (room was not ready yet) and went to get a bite at the breakfast buffet. Even though I had checked in I was not permitted into the area because I had no key. I grabbed a coffee from the lobby and ate somewhere else. This was the only issue I had. My experiance was great here. I will come back here to stay when I am in town again. Staff were very nice and helpful."
"This is by far one of the most hospitable Homewood Suites / Hilton properties I have ever stayed in. Was here for business and from arrangement to book a meeting room for a Caucus meeting to the front desk and most importantly the welcome from the Valet personnel at the entrance. Sal and Amer have hospitality in their blood and the hotel is lucky to have them and their team welcoming you. They are the first you encounter prior to going up to the 6th floor where registration is located. Kirstan in the Sales office was efficient and great with a thank you follow up. I was fortunate to meet one of the Managers as well and he too was welcoming and eager to offer any assistance I may need... Keep up the great work, I will definitely stay here when I return to Chicago as the location offers many choices for dining and night life and only a block off of ""Miracle Mile"" (which I never went to since there was so much to offer off the Miracle Mile)

"I have never been so welcomed at a hotel. Every person I encountered asked me how my stay was, trying to ensure the experience was up to expectations. I was greeted at the door by name every time I entered or left the hotel. The concierge staff, specifically Amir, always asked how I was doing and he and his team were so very friendly. The reservation desk also was very helpful and accommodating. I will be encouraging our travel department to use Homewood Suites as a preferred location when travel to Chicago is required. Great job to all."
"I am currently writing this on my second day here at Homewood Suites on East Grand. Yes, the location is great. However, if you are here for business and not tourist or have a need to sleep soundly in temperature controlled room, there are some things to be mindful of. Upon entry into our room, it was diappointingly tired looking, small for a Homewood and warm/stuffy. I adjusted the thermostat(or thought I did). After a half hour it was still too stuffy and there was no cold air when set at 60 degrees. I called down to the desk (btw, the living room phone was broken). Someone was promptly sent to our room. There was no mention on the phone of the A/C not being turned on yet this season..... but this is what the worker told me. He then opened the windows of the 17th floor room to ""circulate"" the air. Okay it was in the 40s so I thought this was a reasonable solution. This was not the case at all. I turned the A/C fan on and off. Closed door to bedroom.... You could tell the air was being pulled out becasue the curtains were blowing toward the outside. Nothing cool coming in. Still hot. I actually propped the door open becasue the hallway was much cooler than our room. Miserable is the only way to describe last night's sleep- or attempt at it. With the open windows you will have to listen to the constant sounds of fire trucks, ambulances, polices sirens, honking, street noise, the construction across the street above the Seasons 52 cafe' because you feel like you will suffocate...... you get the idea. So either you roast in April if the temperature outside is above 40 or still be semi-warm AND tired due to the lack of sleep you will encounter due to the windows open at night. I am now trying to work. The internet is horrible. Thank goodness I have an aircard or I would get nothing done. There is no desk, which I found odd for this chain. That would allow you to work more efficiently and maybe improve the internet situation. The windows are open- again due to the temperature in the room. You cannot take a call and the noise is very distracting. I would never recommend this unless you can sleep through noise and ensure they have the HVAC operating according to the temperatures outside. If you are out and about all day, this may not be a bother. Honestly, I do not know how there are so many 4-5 ratings. But I suppose families and tourists find the location and price appealing especially if they are not in the room >50% of the time. I will attempt to get a fan or something from guest services.... Maybe that will improve this rating prior to my departure."
This hotel is the best value in Chicago. They were attentive and helpful and you couldn't ask for a better rate in such a fantastic location. We had a sick infant while there and didn't want to go out into the sub zero Chicago weather when he had a fever. We used their grocery service and they brought us back diapers and infant tylenol for no additional up charge. It was a great service and much appreciated! I will definitely stay there again.
"We are visiting from Indonesia, and have stayed in Homewood Suites Chicago for a week. The food was great, location is perfect, facilities are excellent, and the room is very spacious and clean, the bed is very comfy, And the staff were great, from the front desk, the bell boys, and the room service were very friendly, especially the lady we were acquainted, her name was Manna Vargas, was very very nice. We definitely recommend this hotel, and will come back and stay here again. thank you"
"Excellent location, excellent rooms and the most fantastic staff I have ever come across on our holidays to USA. They were exceptional. The breakfasts were are a good start to the day and the pool on the 19th floor was great for either an early morning or late evening swim. It was always empty during our stay Oct/Nov. We asked for a corner suite and the view at night was amazing! The chamber maid Marianna did an excellent job. We loved our stay at this hotel!

"From the front desk to the valet to the woman serving at breakfast, the staff at the Homewood made dwell welcome and provided outstanding service. Mr. Amer greeted me every morning with a smile a quickly called a taxi for me, allowing me to spend minimal time in subzero temps. Lorena at the front desk was able to accommodate all of my requests and had some great restaurant recommendations! Connie always greater me with a smile and laugh at breakfast and made me feel welcome with friendly conversation. Thank you staff of Homewood. I will definitely be staying here whenever possible!"
"This was my first time staying at this hotel. I loved the location - close to shopping, a choice of restaurants, and even a movie theater - and the staff was great. I had a room on the top floor (19th) and enjoyed the view. The exercise room was also on the top floor and offered a great view of the city while working out. There was also a pool which I'll need to take advantage of next time I stay there. My room was very clean and had a lot of nice amenities in the kitchen. I liked the abundance of plugs for my computer and chargers. The bed was really comfy. I had a little surprise one morning with a window cleaner dangling outside, but that's why you keep your curtains closed! I'm definitely staying here again.


Room Tip: The higher the floor the better, but all sides of the hotel have good city views.

"This hotel is centrally located, just a block off the magnificent mile and a block from the Grand red line stop. You can get anywhere very quickly. The rooms are suites with a kitchen, bedroom and living room. The kitchen which makes it nice for leftovers from the many area restaurants you will want to try. There is a nice breakfast everyday with make your own waffles (this area can sometimes be chaotic with rookie waffle makers!), pastries, bagels. yogurt, fresh fruit, scrambled eggs, a breakfast meat that changes and a potato that changes. They also serve dinner and drinks during the week. It was also nice to have coffee and tea always available in the lobby. It was a cold week and this was a nice stop on the way up to the room. The staff is very nice and really seem to care that you enjoy your stay. There is a nice but small pool on the 19th floor, stocked with towels. It is a great view while swimming. This is one of our favorite places to stay in Chicago for the location, extra touches and value."
"We have started staying at homewood suites with our two kids (9 & 11) because the suites give us plenty of room. This location & hotel were awesome mostly because of the service! From the valet to the front desk to the housekeeping to the breakfast, everyone was so accommodating and kind. Amer and the valet team were great and the front desk found me a phone charger and charged my phone when I needed it. They had dvds and games for the kids and my son loved the 24 hour hot cocoa too :) Great location!"
"We stayed here for about a month because of a house fire. From the minute we checked in with Starr at the front desk, to our first breakfast with Connie offering a warm smile, it made a bad circumstance better. Monica made sure our room was clean and Amir and the valet team were very accommodating. We enjoyed staying here! excellent location. The only improvement would be better internet connection."
"I had put in a request for a corner suite when booking the room and was given the same room as the year before only one floor down. I highly recommend a corner suite as it has extra windows enhancing the wonderful view. I was pleased they were able to meet my request.The front desk, breakfast, pool, room, and especially the bell staff were wonderful as usual. The bellman named Amer remembers my family and I even though we only visit once a year. He is wonderful.The room was clean, comfortable and spacious as always. The room is, however, starting to age. The carpet was frayed where it meets the wood laminate and the furniture, doors and so forth are starting to show signs of age. That's the only reason I marked this visit as 4 star but I certainly plan on staying there in the future.

"This hotel is in a very convenient location in the River North neighborhood, just a block from the Red Line. There are lots of restaurants, bars, and stores nearby. If you're planning to buy your own groceries, there is a Jewel grocery store and a Trader Joe's within a couple of blocks and a Whole Foods several blocks away.The service was excellent, particularly the doormen and the front desk staff. Their friendly service helped me to quickly feel at home.My suite was very nice. I like to cook my own meals when I travel, so I appreciated the kitchenette which had a full-size refrigerator, a microwave, a small cooktop with two burners, and a dishwasher. The kitchen was stocked with pots and pans, dishes, and utensils. The living room included a small table that doubles as a dinner table and a desk. The bed and the pillows were very comfortable. My only complaint was that I could hear a fair amount of noise from the hallway, even though my suite was at the end of the hallway."
"My husband and I stayed at this hotel for 3 months and did not have a single complaint the entire time we were there. The hotel staff is very helpful, thoughtful, and professional. Our room was always extremely clean and the weeknight dinners and daily breakfasts were always good. The location is perfect if you want to enjoy downtown Chicago, especially Michigan Avenue, River North, etc. However, the best part of our stay was the spectacular service, smiles and help (with anything) the door staff provided every day and all day. Amer, Noah, Ray and the rest of the team...you make the Homewood Suites stand out from ALL other hotels in Chicago and we will surely recommend to others that they stay here because of the great, consistent service you provide to all guests--thank you again for everything. (from Meg & Tory)."
"Have stayed at this hotel several times. Always a super location if visiting downtown Chicago for shopping, sights and restaurants. Extremely convenient location. Great breakfast, nice rooms. Somewhat tight for a ""suite"" but you are downtown in a high rise building after all. Noticed on our last stay that rooms were starting to show signs of wear. Not bad, but not as fresh as it's always appeared in the past. Only real con is the wait for the elevator which can be somewhat lengthy."
"My wife and I stayed here for 4 nights just before Xmas 2013.We had a suite which had a separate living area and a kitchen. Although not really luxurious and perhaps a bit 'tired' in places (carpet had a few burns etc), we felt that our accommodation was very good value and appreciated having a suite instead of a standard hotel room.One of the best features of the Homewood Suites was the included breakfast buffet. It was nothing too fancy, but typical American fare such as waffles with strawberries, bagels, cereals, danishes, fruit, yoghurt, scrambled eggs etc. This is pretty common in American hotels, but I had never stayed anywhere before where they also had a free dinner included on weeknights. Again this was not fine-dining, but was perfectly adequate on nights when we didn't feel like going out. Things like soup, various pasta dishes as well as including beer and house wine.The staff we dealt with at Homewood Suites were friendly and helpful and it was very centrally located, near a subway station and a short walk to the Magnificent Mile. There were lots of bars and restaurants nearby, as well as grocery stores. There was also an indoor pool, though we never saw it or used it and so cannot really comment on that feature.They had a coin-operated guest laundry which we used on our stay.We would definitely consider staying here again if we return to Chicago."
"I couldn't have asked for more on our family stay at this hotel. For $109/night in downtown Chicago, and a suite with fully equipped kitchen, free breakfast and Wi-Fi? Unbelievable! **Granted, this was over a weekend in January, so rates are low anyways.** Only detail I would change: hotel only has 2 luggage carts. It wasn't a problem checking in, but when it was time to check out at 11, there was a line of people waiting for a cart. My husband ended up hauling all our luggage in multiple trips to our car in a nearby parking garage. Slowed down checkout process."
"We got a great rate during our January stay (Thurs - Sat). We wanted to stay near Michigan Ave. We stayed for 2 nights in a one room (king bed) suite. Kids stayed on the pull out couch. This hotel is located across the street from Nordstroms. So it was a short walk across the street into the mall, then a warm walk through the mall out to Michigan Ave. Overall I would give this a high rating. There were a few small cosmetic issues in the room: slightly peeled wall paper and some fraying carpet. Other than that, the room was clean, kitchenette well stocked. Great views of the city and nice warm swimming pool which the kiddos enjoyed.Breakfast was fine with hot food options and waffles with strawberry and whipped cream toppings. We thought the waffles were very yummy, light and fluffy. Better than most hotel waffles. Best part was definitely the staff! Breakfast was very busy but they were quick to clear tables and ""seat"" us. Clearing while we were eating was a nice touch and kept things flowing and clean. Marcus at the front desk was awesome! Our girls were given pictures to color, said that if returned a prize would be given. We expected a sucker or something small but was given a nice souvenir tshirt. Great surprise. This hotel definitely added to our Chicago weekend in a good way. It was great to be downtown at an affordable rate. I will mention that we did not use the hotel parking ($55 overnight). We used spothero and got a rate of $24 overnight at the Grand Plaza parking (2 blocks away) so short walk but very manageable. I would highly consider this hotel again.


Room Tip: Ask for a high floor for awesome views.

"Marcus is a excellent addition to your staff. He was so helpful in solving a problem that we had with a reservation. We have had a tradition now for 27 years coming to Chicago with moms, daughter, and this year for the first time granddaughters. We have stayed at the Homewood suites but this year when I called the end of December they said that you were booked. Marcus kept our tradition going which is one that means the world to all of us.Please take note of what a wonderful employee you have. Thank you and hopefully the Homewood Suites will be our home away from home in many years to come. Shelley Dickinson , WI."
"Millennium Knickerbocker is a stylish old hotel in the heart of Chicago! It makes you feel like you took back in time. Its location is excellent: Just off the famous Magnificent millennium and lake Michigan, so you are close to everything.I stayed at this hotel for 4 nights. Check in was fast and easy. I had a corner room, clean and large enough with comfortable bed and linens. Staff were friendly and helpful. They had great advice for getting the most of my stay in the city.I recommend this hotel to anyone for a pleasant stay in Chicago at an affordable price."
"For a stateside hotel, especially one in an old building, it is comfortable and the rooms fairly modern. As is a common problem with lots of downtown hotels in the US however the rooms are quite dark and when you delve a little deeper and look around the room it doesnt maintain the initial level of ""gloss"" that it is trying to portray. For such a central location it is fairly quiet which is a big bonus. The location is excellent however, just by the main shopping street of Michigan Avenue, in a classy and safe neighbourhood. Pros: Location, fairly modern roomsCons: Beds/pillows not the best quality, gym is very shabby."
"My parents visited me this weekend and we decided to all stay in River North. This hotel had great reviews, however I can't find much to say that is great.First night we are placed right outside of the elevator, a cramped room with a faulty fan and tv. Go to ask the front desk in the morning to switch rooms which they allowed but now have us in a room with stains on the carpet and again tv isn't working. Not sure if because it is the Final Four that they are blocking TBS.I won't be back."
"This was our first stay at the Nickerbocker, but it won't be the last. That is because the room was comfortable, but primarily because of your staff, especially Joshua. He checked us in where we felt at home, he was so kind and helpful. Secondly Craig was very helpful as well. In the end it is people who make the difference, and your Joshua is on the top of the list, in our opinion!Steve Albers"
Great location but rooms the size of a cruise ship room. Very small & uncfortable bed. Staff nice & accommodating. Spend the extra money on a nicer room! Showers not the best and when getting dressed either me or my husband had to leave the room because no room! One day I took all of my things to the spa down the street to get dressed & shower without feeling claustrophobic. Oh and they preset the heat/ac so you cannot adjust. We were always burning up with no way to change it so we turned off the heat completely and still too hot!
"Overall good experience. Clean, updated, ample sized room. Crisp linens, comfortable bed and comforter, plenty of towels. Shower was not my favorite. The giant rain head was just too much for the tiny stand-up, especially if you do not want to get your hair wet. Was in Chicago for business, so utilized the conference facilities. They were basic, lighting was a little dim, but fine. Upstairs restrooms were clean. Elevators are small and slow, so allow yourself a minute or two. Breakfast was delicious. Great coffee. Enjoyed cocktails from the martini bar which were all amazing, fresh and tasty! The first room I was assigned to lacked a smoke alarm. I immediately called the front and was assigned a new room right away. No room service available, unless I called too late, but I was led to believe it just wasn't an offered amenity. Convenient location. Would stay here again."
"Great hotel to serve as a base for enjoying Chicago's Miracle Mile! Got an early check in and had two really nice rooms with the most comfortable hotel beds experienced in years. The lobby bar had a Friday night piano player, followed later by a jazz trio, and large screen TVs for sporting events. Although we caused a minor accident with broken glass in the lobby, Junior Therriauix, the manager on duty, eased the tension with humor and took care of us and the mess, allowing us to remember why staying at a great hotel enables great memories. The 80+ year old conciegre is wealth of knowledge who provided information obout restaurants and travel that allowed us to take advantage of things we otherwise would have missed. Definitely worth a return visit!"
"The hotel was walking distance from several shops, restaurants, and other things to do. It is right next to the 360 Chicago building and close to Rush St. and Michigan Ave where you'll find plenty of restaurants and bars. The room was a bit tiny but clean and comfortable. Bathroom was updated and had an overhead shower. The hotel elevators super small. Overall, I enjoyed my stay and would definitely stay there again."
"I'm not sure how the app Travelzoo gets their inventory, but the app posted a $85/night rate and upon arrival, I was told that they could not honor that. The front desk man was very slow and told us a rate, much higher, and then recanted that rate and said, oh that's not available either. It felt like we were lured in and then taken advantage of. We were tired and just didn't want to hassle finding somewhere else, so we took the room at almost $200/night + $67/night for parking (seemed a bit high compared to other places I stayed in Chicago) Our room phone did not work. Our TV did not work. We could not get connected to Wi-Fi (and were reluctantly willing to pay for it). I have stayed at much nicer, better priced hotels. I would not stay here again."
"This was a break in tradition for us. With travel accounts, we usually stay at one of two brands that have several properties on and around Michigan Ave. This time, I wanted to try a hotel with a different feel. The property is about 2 blocks from Michigan Ave - and close to Lakeshore Drive; so well situated. It definitely retains it's old time grandeur in the lobby and common areas. A huge chandelier with very ornate decor, so unique. Like everywhere, your valet parking will be quite expensive - but the staff was exceptional as you'd expect. There is a bar and a restaurant in the lobby. Be prepared, the elevators are very small. 4 people with one bag each, or 6 people with no luggage, and you're elbow to elbow. Again - they've retained their old time charm, so who can complain! The rooms are where you'll find modern conveniences. We had two rooms, 1King and 2double - both had computers in the room...so handy. Each had large 40in (?) TVs and the bathrooms were nicely remodeled. The bathroom in the 1K was very very small. I'm 5'6 and i could extend my arms and touch the shower glass enclosure and the counter. Plenty of room, just small. Our 2nd room with 2 double beds had a much larger bathroom, if that's of any issue for you. Again, our rooms faced out to the interior corridor of the hotel, which had a quite dismal view of the same backside of the Westin hotel. Just hundreds of windows closed in around you blocking out all natural light, etc. Our recommendation is to ask for a street facing room - problem solved. The concierge and bell captain were terrific, check in and out was simple. One room had an honor bar stocked and the 2nd room, empty. Be sure to look when you check in to ensure you dont get charged for something you didn't use!! I would recommend this, and would stay here again!


Room Tip: Interior wall rooms face out into a dismal U shaped view of the backside of the westin hotel rooms...

"My husband and I stayed at the Millennium Knickerbocker in July 2014 and we loved it. Were very pleased with our room after reading many negative reviews. It was clean, tidy, spacious and had a nice view too. The staff, especially the Manager Sam, were wonderful. Its location is outstanding. If you want to shop the Magnificent Mile, you are RIGHT there. And I can't walk a lot but boy was I checking out all the shops! Public transport is also nearby to take you to Navy Pier, Millennium Park, or just the other end of the Mile. The only drawback was concierge - not very helpful at all. I would suggest you ask reception instead (or the bartender - he was very helpful too). Great restaurants also within walking distance too."
We have stayed in the Knickerbocker on three different occasions (every time with kids) and we love it. Easily the best hotel we have stayed in in Chicago (10+ trips). Very nice and spacious rooms and you can't beat the location. Every time we have needed the staff they have been nice and very helpfull. One time they even got a hold on our cabdriver while we were going to the airport to tell us we had forgotten our stroller. We are planning on coming back in march. Only negative is that there is no free wifi.
"We stayed in one of the suites here, the room was nice with a soaking tub, location was great near main shopping strip. Unfortunately that's where it stops. There was no concierge to help us with planning activities, lucky we had trip advisor to helpYou have to pay to use Internet!!!The staff in general were absolutely useless , I think it's a moral thing as I heard some talking on how they hated working there.Overall there are better places to stay near byOnly once out of the week we stayed did the bellboys get me a cab, it was to cold for them to go outside, or maybe they just weren't engaged in their job"
"My family and I stayed here this past summer when in town for the Orioles vs Cubs games. First off, the location is wonderful! Just a few steps and you're on the Magnificent Mile or over by the beach/lake area. The bus was easy to catch when we needed to get somewhere and right around the corner. The closest El stop was several blocks away though. When we checked in, my parents room was ready right away while my sister and I had to wait.I had called ahead the day before and that morning and was told both rooms would be ready. I understand things happen though so I wasn't too upset by that and we put our stuff in my parents room. Once we got to our room, it was spacious, plenty of room for 2 girls to get ready and throw our stuff around. The elevators though - very small! Then again, this an older hotel and you could say it's part of it's charm. However, two nights we were there at one point only one elevator worked and everyone was playing the waiting game. When i walked up the steps to try and nix the elevator I found out that the steps start at the 3rd floor so you had no choice but to wait. (Also, just curious isn't that a fire code violation to have the stairs start on the third floor?) The staff though, while I did have one nice front desk attendant, the others were a bit rude and stand offish. There were two times when I was standing there waiting to be helped and they just kept talking to each other in the backroom."
"I went to see my daughter in Chicago and see the city. My first time outside of O'Hare Airport. When we arrived, the staff was great, but my wife had made a reservation for two rooms, one under our name and the other inadvertently ended up under my (soon to be) son in law's name. As I was unaware of this, the clerk at the counter could not find the reservation and copped an attitude that I was lying to sneak in an extra room or God knows what...He was arrogant and obnoxious, had my daughter not been there, I would have punched him out. Upon leaving, there was a second charge for valet parking on the same day. We took cabs and never moved the car. When I approached the (same) clerk about it, again with the attitude as if I was lying. This time my daughter wasn't around, but the GM was when I went to his office. They fixed the billing error, but not the employee attitude. I would never go back at the prospect that a single dime of mine might contribute to this person's salary."
"I have to say checking into this hotel we were greeted warmly and then it was kind of a disaster. The woman said you booked through Expedia? Which Zi did not I used AA miles, what difference does it make?After 3 attempts to register our CC they finally just gave us the keys and let us go to the room. The rooms are very comfortable, the beds are great. The bathrooms have been updated with this rain shower head that is so awkward it really is very uncomfortable to take a shower, you have to stand sideways. Then the worst part was our room was never cleaned we saw two maids on our floor inquired to both and they said our room wasn't one of theirs. Finally someone said they would clean our room. When we returned our room was still not serviced, I went down to the lobby spoke to Sam and when I questioned it he apologized and said he would look into it. Seriously what good is that going to do us? When I walked away saying I would leave a bad review he called our room 10 minutes later saying he was going yo comp the 10.95 Wi Fi charge which in my opinion should be free and 2 drink coupons fir the bar, I said there are 4 of us and he said ok Ill give you 4 but that's it. Now I'm on the phone holding over 8 minutes because they are trying to charge me for a diet coke from the mini bar that we did not drink. Never staying here again! P.S. Henry just removed the charge one smart employee!"
"The Knickerbocker provided nice accommodations for a couples friends weekend in the city. I enjoy staying in a smaller and quieter hotel in the city and the location here is great! Our room was a standard king and rather small, as you would expect for a small, older hotel. The mattress was just okay, but the linens were very nice. The lobby coffee shop provided a nice breakfast, but not complimentary. One evening there was hot chocolate in the lobby, but only on a Friday night. Having ice water or some hot complimentary beverage, especially during cold winter, would have been an easy and nice addition to their service. The lobby bar was small, but nice with a good bar tender. Very friendly and helpful staff!!"
"When we first checked in the hotel staff was quite friendly, the hotel itself is the only reason this hotel deserves a 2/5. The bed was very comfy, and the room is a decent size for chicago. Other than that the employees paid absolutely no attention to my boyfriend and I, however would chat up anyone that had a very expensive look to them. Our bar fridge was missing items when we checked in, we were woken up to drilling in the room beside us at 8 in the morning on the day of checkout, and by 9am every morning staff would come knocking at the door to try and clean or refill the fridge. The location is perfect if visiting Michigan Ave but other than that if you are staying as part of a ""vacation"" I'd stay elsewhere. Apparently wearing dark blue jeans and a black pea coat with black boots meant that I wasn't worth their time and deserved to be treated rudely. Also asked to use a phone as we were having issues with ours and one of the employees commented on how ""in america they use cell phones"" making remarks on us being Canadian. Overall not at all impressed with the service we received and will not be staying here again."
"We just checked out of this boutique Chicago hotel on the North end, just East of Michigan Ave. My husband booked the weekend and we enjoyed the stay very much. Sam, at the front desk, was super nice and accommodating. He greeted us as we checked out as if he truly remembered us!Brian, at the martini bar....what can we say but this man gives the most tremendous customer service and makes one heck of a martini! Thank you to Junior, as well, for making our stay so lovely and we certainly are rooting for purse hooks under the bar and a beautiful gold colored chalk board wall to announce your daily/seasonal specials. We will certainly be back for another visit as soon as possible.Merry Christmas and Happy New Year from the Martin's.....Ron and Kristi"
"I stayed here with my wife and toddler for the weekend. It's a very nice old hotel. The rooms were updated and clean but small. As everyone has mentioned, the elevators are small but weren't inconvenient. The concierge, valet and baggage attendants went out of their way to help with everything. My only complaint is at ~$65/ night, the valet was expensive but self park across the street was ~40. Overall we really enjoyed our stay."
"This was a decent hotel. It didn't wow me by any means, but the room was fine and the bathroom although small was modern and clean. Elevators are tiny...no more than 6 people and if there are bags, more like 3 or 4. During checkout times, be prepared to wait a good 6 or 7 minutes for an elevator...or just take the stairs. Gym was decent as well. The belts on the treadmills were loose so no way I could run on them. All in all a decent hotel, but not extraordinary."
"I can easily recommend this hotel to anyone who wants to stay in Chicago. Although it's a few blocks from the Loop and the CTA, a dozen bus routes pass nearby and it's ground zero for cabs, day or night. It's also ground zero for tourists, and if you're in town to do Magnificent Mile, deep dish pizza, etc, you could hardly do better than this place. They run excellent specials and you can get a room here at a deep discount on certain nights.The rooms are comparatively small, but why would you spend time in your room when there's so much to see and do outside?"
"Stayed at the Millenium for my bday weekend, was between here and the Drake. Should have stayed at the Drake. The Millenium was fine but with all the history I was hoping to feel like ""old chicago"" I guess the super small elevators and no room service is the only way you know you are in such a landmark. Rooms were small but well appointed and location was great. Not much to say just a standard stay"
"Nothing terribly wrong here - good location, o.k. bar, hotel room was small but o.k., bathroom fine, clean and pretty quiet. My biggest issues were: 1) the maid service banged on the door between 7:45 and 8:30 each morning. What? This is too early. I was on jet lag the first morning and this was really bad not to get an extra 45 mins of sleep before I had to get up; and 2) slow slow service in the restaurant at breakfast - of 3 mornings, 2 took me over an hour to eat. The first morning, it took a half hour to get coffee and to order then another 20 mins for food. They said the kitchen was behind but it didn't look that way - it looked like only one waiter for the entire room. I wouldn't let these things keep you away - you can put the privacy note on door, and plan ahead re breakfast but the hotel should make adjustments.


Room Tip: If you are not alone, ask about room size. They can be small.

"There is no denying that the Millennium Knickerbocker Hotel is old, if you have a split second of a doubt checkout the projector sitting over the doorway used to show sports at the bar. Aside from that there are little tip offs: small elevators and hallways, doors look worn, etc. However, I was wildly impressed with how modern the rooms were. I stayed overnight for a work commitment and got a great nights sleep. I'd recommend the Knickerbocker to anyone interested in staying in the area."
"We knew it was a beautiful, historic hotel with a great location, but we didn't know the phenomenal level of customer service we'd receive. The staff, led by a gentleman named Junior, was exceptionally friendly and supremely helpful in helping me coordinate a proposal in their gorgeous ballroom. The bar is warm and inviting, the rooms are clean and comfortable, and the staff makes the hotel feel like a home away from home. We will DEFINITELY be coming back to the Knickerbocker."
"Stayed for about four nights in August at the Millennium Knickerbocker in Chicago just off the Magnificent Mile. It's in a great location, walking distance to the shops on the mile and the lake in the other direction. Check in staff were delightful, really nice chap on the front desk. Room was nice, bed was big, decent tv and the bathroom modern and stylish with a waterfall shower. We even had a slither of a lake view through the window. Hotel has a real old school classy vibe which I liked, no pretensions of trying to be all modern and trendy, just a classy old school hotel that looks after its guests. The lobby is very grand and you might spend a lot of time there as the one drawback of the hotel is no wifi in the rooms, so you have to go down to the lobby if you don't want to pay. Overall, great place to stay, nice location, nice rooms, nice staff, the concierge even picked up my sunglasses and returned them for me when I left in them in the lobby."
"Yes, it's an older hotel but newly renovated and very affordable. Loved it. Big spacious bedroom, wonderful bed and sheets, and a very large bathroom. In so far as the interior design is concerned I cannot find fault, it was superb. However the housekeeping wasn't quite up to my standard. The room was clean but empty cans and bottles were left behind as well as candy wrappers and paper cups. Don't know why they weren't thrown out? And with two people in the room why do they only leave one little shampoo? We can't share one little bottle of shampoo. I always had to ask for an extra. Weird. But altogether the staff was very friendly and we had a great stay.

"I just got back from a two night stay at this hotel. My first impression was so positive as my 3 friends and I were greeted by a lovely girl at the check in desk. Check in was quick and pleasant! The elevators were so fun..they were small, but mirrored all around. Our room was clean and the perfect size. The bathroom was big with a rain shower head. The closet was spacious and even lighted.The location is absolutely perfect. Water Tower Shopping, Hancock Building, Michigan Avenue all ""right there"". The martini bar is large and comfortable. Thank you Michael for your delicious drinks and your sweet and kind spirit.The building itself is beautiful and full of character. My next visit to Chicago will include a stay here!"
"I stayed at the Knickerbocker a few nights while visiting some family in Chicago. The good stuff: The hotel location is great and easy to walk to shops and restaurants or even grab a taxi. The service of the hotel personnel was top notch. Everyone from the reception desk, the restaurant, the bar, the bellhops, the concierge, the door man --- all extremely helpful, friendly and attentive. The hotel itself is old and a lot of the carpets and furnishing are quite dated. The room furniture and carpet and curtains all seemed to be old. However, the room was clean even if outdated. The negatives for me was for one the lack of room service options (even though take out restaurant info was provided) and also some problems with the temperature in the room. The air seemed to go out in the middle of the night one night and we woke up to sauna conditions. We ended up finally getting a window open in the morning. It was fixed after housekeeping came that day, but the air unit was extremely loud after and kept me up most of the next night as well. So I didn't sleep so great, but it was only a few nights anyway. All in all, a nice hotel for the price we got on this website."
"I was nothing but disappointed by this hotel. For the price that our room was per night, we could have stayed at many other lavish hotels off a Michigan Ave and how I wished I would have! There were multiple issues I ran into. I feel the need to express them here because at checkout I was provided a slip of paper to leave my comments. When departing, the individual at the front desk just threw it into the trash without even reading it. --Upon arriving, the hotel staff knew nothing of our conference which was to begin the very next day. While this was a small conference, this is exceptionally abnormal to me. I've planned many events at hotels across the country and every time, they are well prepared and know what events are running throughout the hotel. The staff claimed that they did not receive the next day's events until they batched that evening. --While this is supposed to be a historic hotel, I found it less than impressive. The front check-in desk is very unimpressive (it literally looks like a closet or some managers back office. When you are charging that much for a room, guests expect a certain experience. There were cardboard boxes sitting on the back counter and papers strewn everywhere - it communicated chaos to me. --My stay was in late-October and MY ROOM HAD NO HEAT. When I called the front desk about this I was told they are in their ""cooling season"" and that heat was not available (hello - it's October in Chicago!). When I called back the second day, I was informed that this is an old hotel and in some rooms the heat does not work. Fortunately I was provided a heater for my room but didn't feel comfortable letting it run all night. It did help but this was just absurd! Whenever the air was running (before I realized heat wasn't available to me) there was a constant hum from the wall air unit (as another reviewer mentions). --Checkout for the hotel was provided via a printout under my door. ""Express Checkout"" was to return a slip of paper to the front desk (which also asked for any feedback for the property). This is exceptionally dated to me. For what I was spending per night, I would consider this a high-end hotel - let alone most hotels these days are more up to date with technology. The only positive thing I have to say is that the catering staff who assisted with the conference I attended was very attentive and friendly."
"We stayed at this hotel for 3 nights and really enjoyed it. Check in was quick and easy, and our room (standard king) was large enough for 2 people to use comfortably. The room was clean and the bed comfortable, and the TV huge for the size of the room!The location was probably the best thing about the hotel, it was literally a 1 minute walk to N.Michigan Avenue (Magnificent Mile) where you could find many shops and restaurants.The style of the hotel was nice, a little vintage but well done, a lot of character has been kept.We visited the bar a few times and service was good, though the martinis were a little expensive.The only criticism was that wi-fi was only free in the lobby."
"Arrived at this hotel to find I had cockadoodled the booking and should have turned up in January!!! However the reception staff were sympathetic and gave us the room we had requested and agreed to waive some of the cost,(a little more would have been appreciated) but they could have charged me the full amount. The hotel is faultless, make sure to look in the ballroom which was at the centre of Hugh Heffner's Playboy empire. The staff were friendly and knowledgeable and the rooms very comfortable. The hotel is a stones throw of a lovely little beach and all the attractions of the Magnificent Mile.


Room Tip: We were in a top floor corner room.

When booking through trip advisor-Expedia etc. all sales are final when booking. Unfortunately for my wife and I had to check out one day early due to illness in family. The receptionist said that was not a problem mainly because it was not their issue it was through Expedia and he failed to notify us. Otherwise the room was considerably small but clean-no HDTV and the pillows I could put them in a 1 gallon resealable bag. Although we had a great time don't think I would come back there again as I am from a place where hospitality is a given and not to judge people because of what they wear. Yes I'm from the south until I decide to go back do not think it will be there.
"The Millenium Knickerbocker is a budget-friendly hotel right off of the Millenium Mile in Chicago. The staff was friendly, the room was clean and the bed was very comfortable. Also, the room was extremely dark, so I slept quiet well. After a long day, the rain shower felt amazing. If you're travelling with kids, there wasn't a tub in the room I was in; not sure if that's common or not. My only complaints would be that the bathroom was really tiny and the small hair dryer really doesn't cut it. Also, soon after I checked in, I had someone come into my room (once I was already there) to check the mini bar from the last guest. I had travelled all day so wasn't too happy with the interruption, which could have been handled before my check-in.All in all a great stay, and the bar at the hotel makes great martinis. I wouldn't hesitate to stay here again when travelling on business.

"We stayed here for 2 nights in September, were in town for medical reasons and the hotel was ideally located for surgeon follow up and surgery center. Was very grateful to have such a great location and at a competitive price. However, make sure you review your bill extremely closely. My card I used to hold the hotel online, as well as the card I provided at check in were BOTH charged the stay of our room +charge for incidentals. The front desk staff stated we would need to call the credit card company and do the leg work to fix their mistake- just what I wanted to do immediately post op. However, they did their best to quickly resolve the charge and threw free wifi in. Then we ordered food from downstairs for pick up and someone down there must have felt like adding on some gratuity which was another trip down to the manager to resolve. Be vigilant of your charges! Otherwise quiet and pleasant room, good service- the shower was a bit of a joke, was glad to have a shower with a hand held for after surgery, however, the top kept falling off and was t even attached! Thank goodness we hand a bandage to keep that in place- classic! Very funny. I would not come back, given some of the other places I've stayed at nearby which are slightly more money but wonderful places in comparison."
"The Knickerbocker is in such a great location that you might be able to overlook some of it's shortcomings......our King room was really small with just barely enough room to walk around the bed; the bathroom was updated with granite and a rain shower, but the water pressure wasn't great (I had to rinse my hair for 5 minutes-and my hair is chin length) and the water temp was inconsistent; the carpet was threadbare in spots and there were nails sticking up in the threshold into the bathroom; we called for a bellhop when we were leaving, but we never got one so we took our own luggage out. All that being said, we had a great room rate as we were in Chicago for a wedding, so that made it a bit better."
"The location of the hotel is perfect for exploring Chicago. The facilities are fantastic, a spacious room with a king size bed and good size bathroom. Bar downstairs has some delicious cocktails for a drink after a long day. There is also a great restaurant around the corner that does top notch American food. Sit at the bar and talk to the friendly bar staff. The only negative is having to pay for internet in the room, which I guess is standard in the US. It is free in the lobby though. Highly recommended"
"A great hotel, perfectly situated a few blocks away from Michigan Avenue and the perfect base if staying in Downtown Chicago.Rooms well appointed and spotlessly clean. Decent toiletries and a robe provided in the bathroom. Drench shower and amusing instruction card describing how to use it and obtain a safe temperature! Seems some people just throw themselves in without testing the temperature first! Didn't dine in the hotel as so many outstanding restaurants nearby, I met up with a friend and went shopping and exploring the the day.On arriving back, there was live music playing in the bar area which was a delight, and it's a great place to enjoy a nightcap before retiring to your room.Entire hotel has a very classy ambience and the staff couldn't do enough to help, friendly and engaging, taking time to make you feel at home.Very much looking forward to returning."
"First trip to Chicago... This was a great hotel with a great location. It was close to Michigan Ave (less than a block) and close to the tour bus stop. The front desk was helpful and more than courteous. We had breakfast at Nix and the service was definitely quick not to mention great food. Will surely stay here again!!

"Iv just returned from a relaxing 5 night stay in Chicago . I stay in this gem of a hotel which is situated just of the mag mile on Michigan ave. for a start I found the the staff to be extremely helpful and very pleasant. The hotel gives a new world feel to its rooms and foyer. We stayed in the basic room which I must was well equipped with all the modern amenities large double bed , air con , inner and out rooms and the very impressive bathroom with both shower and rain shower. There is maid service everyday .I most say I really enjoyed my stay here and highly recommend this hotel which is centrally located in order for you to see all Chicago has to offer."
"Location: It is in a great location, right across from The Drake Hotel, and right across from the beach. However, it is a 10 minute walk or so to a CTA station. The area is near Michigan Avenue, which makes a great place to start the Michigan Ave tour. Hotel: Check-in was smooth, and the room was very modern with a twist of early 20th century flair. The bathroom was magnificent, especially with the rain head feature. The bed was very comfortable and the room was clean. PROS:- Excellent service from staff, with given requests,(holding luggage, extra towels, etc.)- Loved the shower!!- Excellent and comfortable bed- Beautiful views of the CityCONS:- The hallways on our floor smelled musty, and old. It almost smelled liked sewerage, maybe from outside? But it lingered in the halls, and a bit in the room. - Another CON was that a person cannot hook up HDMI devices to the TV. I also like that feature to be able to hook up an IPAD/IPHONE to watch TV, etc. The TV software doesn't allow it from what I can tell.- There is no FREE internet in the room, only in the lobby. It costs an outrageous amount just to have internet, so I suggest doing a hotspot from your mobile device, for wi-fi. Otherwise, I wouldn't recommend staying here unless it's for 100.00 US dollars per night or less including tax. There are a lot better options in Chicago compared to this hotel. I'm giving it 4 stars, losing 1 star due to cost of internet, and price I paid for what I got.


Room Tip: Corner Rooms are the best for views.

"When we arrived, our room was not ready but the frontdesk clerk offered us a complimentary drink at the Martini bar and brought us our key not too long after. The staff was helpful and professional throughout our stay. The restaurant Nix for breakfast is a little too expensive. there are plenty of options around the hotel. The amenities in the room were good and functional. The air conditioning was a little loud but we got used to it. Sometimes, the shower pressure was lacking and it took time for hot water to come. We had a corner room (end of corridor) on the 9th floor. Never heard noise during our stay. The situation of the hotel was a little too far North of downtown so we walked a lot (near John Hancock tower). Over all, I would recommend this hotel for its cleanliness, staff and character.


Room Tip: Upper floors for the view, corner room for quietness

"Stayed for 2 nights to attend a Cubs game in July 2014. Searched for many hotels and pricing, found Millenium Knickerbocker and decided to give it a try. Never stayed in this particular area of downtown Chicago, usually on the south end of the Magnificent Mile.Nice hotel, good staff...small and an older facility, but updated nicely. Biggest complaint was no tub in room. My wife prefers bath to shower.Rooms are small, but comfortable. My wife had a small complaint about the breakfast buffet (food not staying warm) so they gave us her meal for free. It's convenient to shopping and the lake. I would stay there again.Biggest issue: parking cost. There is a public parking garage right across the street that can save you about $12 a day!!"
"The bed was the most comfortable we have EVER slept in, including our own. Add to that a perfectly appointed room with a new computer system that we have not seen in other hotels, a bathroom that walked out of a decorator magazine, and a staff that was not only competent but helpful and friendly, and you have five stars from this reviewer! Before you go out to eat, or do almost anything else, check out the computer."
"I hope this hotel realizes that its not just about things like location or price that determines a good hotel and a hotel that makes people want to come back. It's also the service. I'm so glad I only had to stay here for a day since it was pretty bad, especially the first impression.I was ""welcomed"" by Simeon at the front desk who nearly checked me in until he realized that my the debit card I paid with was not mine but my husband's. But he didn't even say that. Just shook his head and said ""Can't do that."" Can't do what? Did not even look at me and acted as though I took or stole somebody else's card to spend it. My husband had to stay in Chicago for work this week, while I was coming up from Indiana. That's why I had used his card and not mine. So when I showed Simeon my debit card, of course Chase blocked it because it didn't know I was in Chicago. Simeon made the suspicious face again. It's absolutely fine if I need to pay with a card that has my name since I made the reservation. Simeon could have just said so. I could explain why I wasn't using my cards. My husband had just gone parking, so he was returning soon. Simeon shouldn't be making these faces. The people at the front desk are usually the hotel's first impression (maybe the bellboys as well). I don't want to receive suspicious looks and bad service at a place I'm paying to stay. Honestly, this hotel needs to train its people how to treat their guests, explain to their guests, and maybe even how to act.If that"
"As cabin crew we stay in this hotel a lot. We also really rely on a good sleep at our hotels as Chicago is 6 hours behind uk. Every time I have stayed here I get woken up by really noisy people outside my room, which I'm assuming the cleaners and mini bar people. I always put a do not disturb sign on the door so that they know someone is sleeping but that never helps . Maybe the hotel should invest in better doors and soundproof walls or just ask them to be polite and not shout outside people's rooms . Other than this hotel is lovely. Staff at front desk are very helpful Aswel ."
"I booked this hotel via a sort of ""hotel roulette"" from HotWire. I'd do it again. It promised a 4-star average rating hotel in the Magnificent Mile neighborhood for less than $125 per night (plus taxes & fees). Decided to go through with it and was not disappointed. Parking was very expensive but I was able to leave my car with a relative outside the city. The room was small but we had a king-sized bed which was pretty awesome. We were able to leave our luggage with the bellhop before our check-in and after our check-out. I'd stay there again."
"I enjoyed staying at the hotel although the staff was not very helpful. They weren't rude at all, just not helpful. It is not as opulent as the Drake across the street but it is more affordable, more modern room style and they have suites which is nice. The beds were comfortable, it is remarkably quiet, elevators worked well and the location can not be beat for a downtown location. We walked down Rush street every night for dinner and it was beautiful.Also - one downside is that like many of the hotels in Chicago it seems to charge for everything. Parking a car is $65 a night, the wi fi is $11 a day, even an apple cost me $2 - and make sure to incorporate all the taxes into your room rate!


Room Tip: We had a room with a view of an air conditioning unit in back so not very nice. But it was quieter...

"The hotel which claims to be on the ""Gold Coast"" fell short of Gold Coast service. I attended a wedding and the reception was held at the Knickerbocker. Since the ceremony was early afternoon, most guests requested early check-in to change for the wedding ceremony. No one from the wedding party and/or wedding guests (other than the bride) were able to get into our rooms until after the wedding ceremony. There clearly was no preparation from the hotel to accommodate wedding reception guests. We were instructed by the Front Desk to change in the lobby restroom which looked like it wasn't clean from the night before. There was no consideration taken by the hotel's part. Very disappointing!


Room Tip: Plan to check in after 4pm for a clean room.

"My family of four stayed here in August. Bathrooms are newly renovated and very nice. The room was decent. No complaints but it showed it's age. There were several extension cords daisy chained together to provide power to lights. Clock did not work which was annoying. I hate the fact that less expensive hotels can provide free wi-fi access but hotels at the higher end charge for it. I won't pay for it and think it is a rip-off by hotels that charge for it. I asked for a roll-away bed when I checked in but it was never delivered. We happened to have an inflatable mattress just in case and my son was probably more comfortable on that then on a roll away. Valet parking put my truck in another lot one night and had difficulties getting it out the next morning. It took about 30 minutes to get the truck but they did compensate me by comping the parking for one night. All in all, Knickerbocker was a good experience.I would consder staying here on my next visit but I will check out the competition before I book it."
"In the fine city of Chicago, me and some friends stayed 2 (and 3) nights at the Knickerbocker, the inventor of ""Dry Martini""! The location is excellent, two blocks from ""Hancock Tower"", and very close to Lake Michigan. The hotel has an old grand style, and the rooms are very comfortable and spaceious. The staff is efficient and friendly. Breakfast was good, and the bar is cozy.I will recommend this hotel, which is very good value for money! :-)"
"I booked this stay through Priceline after checking with a work colleague in Chicago. The hotel is older but has been modernized...nice marble shower, fine linens. The room was taken up by the King-size bed but for the price of the room - no complaints at all. It is 1/2 block off Michigan Avenue shopping...2 blocks from the lakeshore beach and within walking distance of Millenium Park. Great restaurants and bars nearby on Rush Street. We used UBER to quickly get to Field Museum, Museum of Science & Industry,RiverWalk and Chicago Cut on the River. Henry, the concierge, gave us a voucher to get in quickly at GinoEast (plus free breadsticks) and made reservations at Francescas (got a free dessert). Charlie, the main valet/bellman was wonderful. A great 4 day trip. Biggest shock to me (living in Charleston SC) was the drink prices at about all places...prices very high even compared to Charleston."
"This historic hotel - the site of a gangster speakeasy during the Prohibition period - is a wonderful place from which to see Chicago. The rooms are spacious and extremely comfortable and the hotel bar produces amazing cocktails and delicious food. The staff and unfailingly polite and helpful - the concierge Henry particularly so. The breakfast menu is good and reasonably competitively priced. The location is excellent, a short walk from the lakeside and Old Town and half a block from the Magnificent Mile, so there are a wealth of shopping and eating venues very close to hand. There are also buses to downtown, the Art Institute and many other major attractions. Excellent."
"My daughter and I spent three nights at the Knickerbocker. The location was fabulous, the room very comfortable and the service throughout the hotel was excellent. This is an historic hotel but totally modernized in conveniences and amenities. It is right across the street from the famous Drake Hotel and it is evident that the Knickerbocker keeps up with its neighbors. Breakfast was delicious and served with little elegant touches. We'd come again!"
"This is my second time staying at the Knickerbocker and it was even better than the first time. I love the character and charm displayed throughout the hotel and its staff. It's a flashback in time to a classy 'rat pack' era. The front desk staff was efficient, cordial and accommodating, especially Simeon C., as he worked his magic in finding an extra room so my husband and I could extend our stay. Furthermore, what I sincerely appreciate, is a beautiful, comfortable and clean room. The Knickerbocker has delivered once again, thus we will return as often as possible!"
"Got a 2-day special through Groupon for Knickerbocker and we LOVED the hotel!! So close to great shopping on Michigan Ave. It was beautifully decorated and maintained. Our room was a knock out with soft bed, linens and pillows. The bathroom was modern and elegant. Staff was always smiling and helpful. We ate breakfast for the 2 mornings in the Nix restaurant and it was delicous. Our waiter Alex was extremely friendly and attentive. We are coming back to Chicago in December and will plan to stay again at the Knickerbocker

"This summer my hubby and I went on our honeymoon. He had never been to Chi town so that's where we went. I am forever grateful that I chose this hotel. The staff really goes over and beyond the call of duty to make guests comfortable and happy. When we first arrived the guy at the desk, Simeon, and I were talking and I mentioned that it was our honeymoon. The next thing I know there was a knock on my door and we were greeted with chocolate strawberries and champaign! What a special treat! Our personal bellman Craig was very helpful. Andre and Minerva who served us in the restaurant were also very professional and personable. The beauty of the hotel provides a very nostalgic and refreshing experience. The food was superb! I highly recommend this hotel."
"This is a lovely hotel, don't get me wrong. Full of character, nice staff, comfy king size bed. I'm giving it just 3 points because a hotel without room service is a huge issue for me. I really cannot understand the reason why they dint have room service. I know we have plenty of options just a few minutes away, I know we can order food from the bar and take it upstairs, I know we can order food from outside but guess what, after a long flight I just want to stay in my room, have some food and sleep. And I don't know why, but the air con in my room was programmed for 16C , so my room was freezing cold. But apart from that, lovely hotel."
"I stayed at the Millennium Knickerbocker for a reunion of college friends in late June.

"Well located and courteous helpful staff. Comfortable basic bedroom. Wi fi connection a bit expensive. Booked the hotel via Trip Advisor link to Get A Room Com. Will NOT use them again as after having promised best price guaranteed etc etc they considerably reduced the price after my booking and did not respond to my questions about this. My advice is to book direct or with another agency such as Travel Pony whose pricing policies are transparent.

"We stayed at the Knickerbocker on 4/6/14. We had snagged a Travel Zoo coupon for $109 that included; 1) one night stay, 2) $25 credit at the hotel bar/restaurant, 3) American breakfast for 2 at the hotel restaurant. It was such a great deal that we felt like the hotel was paying us to stay! The hotel is basically across from the Drake so the location is great for shopping. We had a corner room and though the view wasn't much the room was updated and clean, my daughter and her friends stayed in a double which was average but again clean and met their needs. For the price this was great stay!

"This hotel is just steps away from Michigan Avenue, and very close to the John Hancock Building. Room was small, but very clean and everything worked. Some nice artwork on the walls. The lobby area is pretty average, and check-in/out counter is small. Bar area looked a little dated too. If a AAA member, this can help your rate. Parking is expensive. (No surprise in Chicago.) Good people and service. The internet (in room) is not free, but can be accessed in the lobby area for no charge. I personally do not think that any hotel should be charging extra for the convenience of an internet connection in your room. Most hotels I stay at do not charge for it, or is built in to the rate."
"Our experience at this hotel was a bit of a mixed bag, but I will start with the pro's: - Great location. If you are looking to explore Michigan Avenue, have tea at the Drake, or shop at Watertower Place, you will love this location. All of these attractions are within a few blocks.  - Quiet rooms. Perhaps it was the fan that we had to have running in our room (more on that later), but we never heard a noise while in our elevator-adjacent room - Nice historic building. The lobby is nothing to write home about compared to other hotels in the area, but it is nice. - Pleasant staff. Overall, the staff here are great. Our bartender was exceptional as was our waiter for breakfast.Now, the cons: - There is no reasonably-priced parking available anywhere around here. This is not necessarily a fault of the hotel, but it would be nice if they worked out a deal with a nearby parking garage. And if you are like us and don't trust a valet driver with your car, be prepared to walk several blocks and pay $45/night to self-park with no in/out privileges. This isn't out-of-this-world expensive for downtown Chicago, but is still on the steeper side of average for self-park blocks away from your hotel without in/out. Not a deal breaker, but something to be aware of if you are driving into the city.  - Again, this isn't something that the hotel could reasonably be expected to change, but I would strongly advise against staying at this hotel during any change of seasons. The building has an old single pipe ventilation system, meaning that they cannot switch back and forth between heating and cooling; and all rooms have to be in the same mode. So when we came here in early April and it was in the 70's, the heat was still on. Being on the 7th floor our room hovered around 83 degrees during our stay, hence the fan mentioned earlier. Not a reason to avoid this hotel, but a reason to wait and stay here during a time when this wouldn't be as likely to be an issue. - The breakfast looked and sounded fantastic, but was such a let down. The American breakfast runs $17pp, so hardly a budget option, yet the eggs were horribly undercooked (even for overeasy), the potatoes tasted like a chunk of pure rosemary, and my wife's tea didn't arrive until halfway through our meal. The only saving grace here was our waiter, who was great. - This one is another case of being something the hotel cannot be expected to change, but something to be aware of if you are a first time visitor to Chicago. This hotel really has no views, at all, due to it being so much shorter than the hotels around it. Not a big deal to us, and something we were aware of prior to our arrival, but for those visiting for the first time I would recommend a hotel with a view of the lake (The Drake is perfect) or a view down the Mag Mile. Just my two cents. - And finally, the hotel messed up our bill and overcharged us. We had booked our stay directly with the hotel with a discount, and it was to include a $25 voucher for food. I noticed the next morning when we received our bill under the door that they had not deducted the $25. I called the front desk and mentioned this, and was told they would correct it immediately. Unfortunately they seem to have went ahead and pushed forward the incorrect charge, as it came through to my credit card a week later for the original amount."
"Stayed 2 nights recently at the Millennium Knickerbocker Hotel. The Location is fantastic. Many things are within walking distance. I booked online and when we arrived early to check in our room was ready. We had a king bed on the 11th floor. It was very quiet and my quality of sleep couldn't have been better! The bed was very comfortable with plenty of pillows. When we arrived, the room was hot. The front desk staff said they had not yet switched the system over to aircon but with the windows open, it was very nice. There is a nice sized fitness center and also a business center. There was no free wifi. The hotel as well as the room seemed clean and nicely decorated. If you can get a good price for the room, its a good place to stay downtown."
"Stayed here with my sister and 2 nieces. I would have given it 5 stars but they ""upgraded"" us to a 1 bedroom suite. Normally that would be wonderful, but since there were 4 of us, 2 of us ended up on the sofa sleeper. It was comfortable, but I do believe 2 queen beds would have been better. However, with the upgrade we got a really nice bathroom that I doubt all rooms have. The best part of this hotel is its location. Walking distance to everything that a person would need. The staff were friendly and helpful. We use spot hero for our parking needs so we don't need to pay the outrageous Chicago parking fees. Would stay here again."
"Had issues with check-in, had booked through Dial-a-Flight 10 months before travelling and yet they were not able to give us a room that we had booked (2 beds). They offered us an upgrade for $50 per night, then brought it down to $35, this room only had 1 bed but had a sofa bed. On viewing the 2 rooms we declined the upgrade, it certainly wasn't worth it. I had emailed the hotel in advance explaining that we were travelling to celebrate my 50th birthday and asked if they could give us a room on a high floor with a view, not only did they not do this, they didn't even acknowledge the email. The room was past it's best, the curtains were in a poor state of repair, the aircon was not working and if you wanted wifi you had to pay $10.95 a day!"
"Had a 5 day stay at The Millennium Knickerbocker at Gold Coast in Chicago, and have to say everyone of the staff were pleasant, courteous and helpful. We had a Standard Room but this was more than adequate for our needs with large bed, nice Bathroom and large TV, the Reception, Mezzanine and Bar are a nice warm welcome as you walk into the hotel and the attached Ballroom is worth a look for the grandeur. Location is good with the Mag Mile on the doorstep, all attractions are within walking distance,30 - 40 minutes to Navy Pier and Millennium Park respectively likewise to Sears(Willis) Tower, plenty of Restaurants on every street to meet every taste and pocket. We had a small problem with our return shuttle transfer, our tour operator e-mailed the details to the hotel and they printed off our details and liaised with the shuttle company on our behalf which were more than grateful for, so would definitely recommend this hotel to friends."
"The Millennium Knickerbocker Hotel Chicago is the perfect place to stay for solo, business, couples or family travelers. This historic hotel has been beautifully updated and maintained.The hotel retains it's charming grander yet is modern. Above all, the staff are professional, helpful, knowledgeable and friendly. I have stayed in this hotel several times within the last 12 months, and again...

"The property is nice, the breakfast buffet is fantastic and the staff is amazing. Every person we came in contact was so very accommodating and pleasant. Demetrius our concierge knows his city, he prides himself on giving the very best service possible. He introduced us to Francios over at the front desk, he too was wonderful. The doormen, housekeeping, all the staff in breakfast area treat you as if you are the only patron staying there. Yes, the property is nice but there are many nice places to stay in Chicago. The staff makes this place The Place To Stay.

"This hotel is in a great location in Chicago, about a mile or so from Soldier Field. It is near lake Michigan. Within walking distance is the Trump Building and the Chicago Tribune Building. there are plenty of affordable restaurants and bar within walking distance. the hotel is about a 20 minute cab ride from Midway Airport.The Chicago River is on the rear of the property, great view! Get up high as possible.

"Located on the Chicago River with many rooms having a view of part of the City's spectacular skyline, I found no fault with any aspect of our stay in this large and handsomely appointed hotel.Sheraton has a two-tier guest system. Depending on which one you are, you will have to pay extra charges for such things as complete wi-fi access, bottled water (although they did give you one small bottle gratis per night), etc.


Room Tip: Ask for a room with a southern view of the River, Trump Tower, etc.

"Stayed here for two nights during a business conference. Registered as a Starwood preferred guest on arrival and was therefore upgraded to a room on the 30th floor. This was a good size, clean and well decorated. Bathroom slightly dated with no separate power shower just a handheld head over the bath. My room had a connecting door to the neighbouring room which contained a very noisy guest. Avoid these if you want peace and quiet. I did not eat in the hotel apart from during the breaks in the conference. The food and coffee were pretty mediocre by European standards. I had a fantastic view from my room over the Chicago River and downtown. The hotel is well located and a short walk to the magic mile and with easy access to the riverside walk. Staff were polite and helpful. A good place to stay in Chicago."
"Not sure why this place thinks they deserve to be called ""one of the finest hotels in Chicago."" I've traveled extensively, and come to find that my overall impression of a hotel really boils down to the details. The rooms were dated (which is okay), but they were also dirty (not okay). The staff were friendly (great!), but clearly there were not enough of them.There were many things which indicated they were doing the best they could under less than ideal management.There was ALWAYS a long line at the front desk. One evening my key card stopped working, and I waited in line for over 20 minutes to get a replacement. Why on earth would you only staff the front desk for such a large hotel with one person, on a Saturday night?! When I finally made it to the desk. I was asked about my room. I replied that I was less than pleased with the cleanliness, and they offered to move me to another room or provide extra reward points. None of these were very appealing options after a long day, and the room never got any cleaner over the next few days. I was there for a conference, and I guess that the hotel had another event scheduled to start immediately after. While our meetings were still in progress, hotel staff began tearing down vendor equipment and setting up for the next event. This was done without notice, and again - the conference was still in progress as scheduled! Not only was the noise disruptive to the meeting, but several very expensive displays were damaged or destroyed when they were hastily placed on the floor by hotel staff. If you're thinking of scheduling a conference at this hotel, look elsewhere!"
"I stayed at this hotel for a conference at the navy pier - overall good location, nice room, good amenities. The thing that stood out for me was Suzanne at the concierge desk. Suzanne helped make my stay memorable. She was super helpful in booking tickets to see The Second City, which was amazing ""a must see"", she gave me information on how to get half price show tickets to the musical ""Million Dollar Quartet"", gave me some recommendations for places to grab a quick snack before the show, arranged for a late check out to accommodate my conference schedule and flight. She truly went above and beyond. If I could only have someone like her to help coordinate my day to day life! A great trip to Chicago!"
"Recently, my husband and I spent a few days here when visiting our daughter and son-in -law. We had access to the Club Lounge which was great for having breakfast there each morning, Their service and food were sufficient to get your day off to a good start. The views are nice as well from the lounge. Our room was very clean and comfortable bed. The location is great to getting on the main roads by car. It is in walking distance to movie theater. Lots of restaurants are close by and in easy walking distance to get the bridge and take the Architecture boat cruise, see the Wrigley bldg, State Street and lots of other interesting places to visit. We have stayed here several times and are always very happy here with their customer service. The only thing I would say is, if you don't have to have a car to park there don't, as the parking rate is very high as I am sure it is at most hotels."
"The staff and hotel were exceptional. Our trip was made exceptional after meeting the most wonderful and helpful concierge person the four of us ever met. Suzanne was a delight to speak to and deal with on a daily basis. The hotel was a 10 plus but Suzanne made it that much more spectacular. My wife and friends will definitely be back to this hotel. Thank you so much Suzanne

"The Sheraton Chicago Hotel and Towers is situated close to Michigan Ave, the main shopping area of the city. You can walk to Navy Pier, to take in a speed boat ride on Lake Michigan, ride the Ferris wheel to get a bird's eye view of the city, walk to Millennium Park, museums and many other attractions.The hotel is situated on the bank of the Chicago River. You can walk to an awesome architectural boat tour, rent bikes to ride along the coast or go shopping on the Magnifient Mile.The hotel hots Shula's Steak House and has some casual food on the lower level.

"Poor service at check-in. Eventually Put us in a room without a view. Not allowed to use the minifridge. For our own stuff, so had to rent another fridge. Had to pay a lot for Internet. Lousy reception ... TV signal broke up repeatedly.slow internet connection. Ended up having to leave room to watch playoff game. Poor conectivityAt professional meeting in building. Snack bar was only option available for food when we arrived and was poor quality and expensive. Location is isolated...not much retail nearby.Staff didn't care when we voiced our dissatisfaction. But, the bed was very comfortable!

"In town for a conference, so it was great to be right in the heart of downtown, able to make the most of my free time. Being walking distance to the Art Institute of Chicago was wonderful. A shout out to concierge Demetrius Kidd, who was a pleasure to deal with and took the time to make sure I selected the right restaurant for my colleagues and me, get us a table when the restaurant was booked, and even tried to get us a window table. And the front desk readily allowed me to change rooms when I was bothered by the elevator noise.

"I stayed here for 4 nights for a business conference. Staff was incredibly friendly - from Rory at the front desk who checked me in (friendly, funny, and acknowledged I was a preferred hotel member) to Dianne, our waitress in the bar/lounge area. Even as I was checking out, the staff was busy checking in the next round of conference attendees - continually with a smile on their faces. I loved having a 5 minute walk to Michigan Avenue. Hotel is in a nice location on the river, but not on a super busy road, so it was easy to walk around the area. I was here for business, but would definitely stay her for pleasure. I did not experience any issues with the WiFi either on my phone on my laptop in the room. Great job staff!"
"Stayed at the Sheraton for a large conference. I also stayed at the same hotel about 6 months ago. The hotel is nice and the service is responsive. In fact, I think it may have improved sine my last visit.Unfortunately, the WiFi connection was the worst I have experienced at any hotel that claims it is a business-friendly hotel. My apple device was fine, but I had numerous problems with my Dell. Ironically, some IT support people at the Sheraton informed me that Apple devices had the problems logging on. The problem I had was in my room and not in the conference area. I had to make numerous calls regarding initial connectivity and inability to access initial webpages. I also would get kicked off as well. The issues appeared to be idiosyncratic and unpredictable. If you are business traveler of considering a conference, you must have assurances that attendees will have access to highest performing available service if Wifi access is important during your stay,

"Stayed for 5 nights at the Sheraton with my wife, which is right on the Chicago river and close to all amenities. Despite the hotel being extremely busy during our stay due to an Educational conference, the staff were attentive and the hotel very clean. The continental breakfast in the Club lounge was adequate but could have some more variety. The bed was very comfortable and the room had all that was required. We were on the top floor (34) with panoramic views over the city and river. If I am ever in Chicago again I will stay in this hotel.


Room Tip: Club rooms are all on the top three floors with excellent views.

We came to Chicago to attend the performance of a coffin in Egypt at Chicago Opera Theatre. Brilliant performance by the way. The service at the Sheraton is really great. Reception desk was friendly and very responsive to the fact that I have been misled by the website about the availability of free Wi-Fi due to using an AARP rate. The reception clerk was really smart and afforded me the free Wi-Fi. Big points. The room was quite lovely. With very nice modern art work.two small problems a toilet which didn't stop running. And a very loud heating and cooling fan. Would stay here again in a second.
"I travel for business a lot, so driving my wife and mother-in-law for a weekend visit to Chicago from Michigan isn't as high on my list as enjoying a weekend at home. But our mother really deserved a trip to get away. Since I travel so much I tend play the role of making sure the logistics go right for everyone. If you're reading this, you're probably in the same boat I was in of trying to make sure your trip goes well for the sake of all of your group. That can be a lot of pressure right!?! The last thing I want to do is spend my weekend dealing with a miserable hotel experience and feeling bad for the others I'm traveling with who hoped I might be able to help things go well. The bell man who greeted us and checked our luggage while the room was being made up was terrific. Rory checked us in and made sure our accomodations were perfect in every respect. When he heard that this trip was a special theater outing for my mother-in-law I suspect he arranged to provide us a room that offered a great view of Navy Pier and Lake Michigan. Rory at the front desk, the two bellmen that helped us during our stay last Friday and Saturday, 4/10 - 4/11, and the concierge desk that helped my wife with dinner reservations, were all terrific. The entire trip was absolutely great thanks in large part to the Sheraton Chicago Hotel and Towers and their terrific staff!

"This hotel was, for the cost, in the perfect location, with a wonderful view of the river, and the rooms were lovely. The breakfast was great, the pastries phenomenal, and the staff pretty darn helpful. There was some confusion regarding switching rooms (when we arrived, there were not any rooms left with double beds) but it eventually was handled. It is within walking distance of a ton of things to do (as long as you don't mind a little walking aka more than one block). I would stay here again in a heartbeat.


Room Tip: River view, of course!

"I've been visiting Chicago for years and staying at various SPG hotels but had never tried this property. Mostly because I thought it was going to be a bland and unmemorable mega hotel. I'm pleased to report that this was not the case. The common areas and room are really first rate and well-designed. Plus it has one of the better Sheraton Clubs I have had the pleasure to visit with ample seating areas, great views and generous amounts of food in the morning and evening. Plus friendly staff. I exchanged e-mails with concierge and front desk staff prior to my visit and received prompt and helpful responses including a pre-arrival upgrade to a fantastic suite. Another case where I saw the tremendous value and recognition of my SPG Plat membership. (Side note: some hotels really care and make an effort and others do not. I do wish there was more consistency). Nice fitness center and pool. I recommend this hotel and look forward to a return visit."
"The Sheraton is a fine hotel for your next visit to Chicago, but I was somewhat disappointed in my stay there.First the good things: the desk clerk found an available room for me for early check-in... Much appreciated. My room was newly renovated- very nice. I appreciated having the opportunity to opt-out of maid service. In exchange, I was given $15 worth of coupons to use in the hotel for food.Here are the things I wasn't as pleased about: the front desk clerk took forever to check my party in. I find it irritating to pay that much for Wi-Fi in hotels. (I believe it was $13/day.)My room wasn't as quiet as I would have liked. I could hear sounds from the other rooms pretty clearly. Thankfully the other guests were quiet. The view out my window was of a roof and buildings, although I reserved a water view room. In summary, this is an adequate place to stay, but I can't give it an excellent rating."
"I attended a great conference here and stayed for almost a week and was really able to see how this hotel operates and continues to impress travelers. The location is fantastic, for the conference I was on the 20th floor in a double room facing the river with breathtaking city views; for my personal stay after the conference, I was able to switch to a king room which overlooked the lake & river with three large windows also on the 20th floor. The staff was awesome- all the guest services reps, valet, concierge, bartenders and housekeeping were all extremely helpful and super friendly. The hotel was very clean, the conference spaces were well organized and all the food for the four day conference was very good and the beds were comfortable. The hotel location allowed us to walk to Navy Pier, Millennium Park, good restaurants and lots of shopping- and there is even a Whole Foods Market & Movie Theater right across the street. I can't recommend the Sheraton Chicago Towers enough, they really go out of their way to make sure you enjoy your stay!"
"I've stayed at the Sheraton Chicago Hotel and Towers a number of times, and it never disappoints. The common areas are really lovely, and the rooms are very good as well. Food and beverage, everything else, is first-rate. What make this hotel stand apart is 1) location --what a beautiful spot! and 2) Staff. From the bellmen to the front desk staff, to the concierge to housekeeping, everyone is great. I'll be back, and very soon!


Room Tip: upper floors facing the river are the best.

"I recently stayed at the Sheraton for 3 nights while attending a conference. I had just come from another hotel stay where the customer service was horrid and the entire experience was dreadful. I wasn't really looking forward to another hotel stay but have to say, I was pleasantly surprised. Everyone I met, from the front desk staff to housekeeping could not have been more pleasant and kind. The room was clean and comfortable, love the bedding--I slept better than I do in my own bed at home! The location is perfect--great views of the lake, river front and skyline, close to great shopping and restaurants. I got the Sheraton experience, for sure, and this will be my go to hotel when I'm in Chicago!"
Well yes I think this hotel more than met my expectations for the great price! This was my 1st visit to Chicago and a much needed girls weekend with my bestie! We are from a very small town (the hotel had more people in it than my town does lol) and we may have got lost in the hotel but a nice lady pointed us in the right direction. Every one of the hotel employees were friendly and helpful for us 1st timers!The rooms were very nice also! Very comfortable beds. Also the hotel is in a great location! Right in walking distance to many attractions or a short can ride. I would definitely stay here again and recommend to anyone going to Chicago!
"This was our family's fourth stay at this hotel. It is rare to get the combination of incredible location, clean, renovated rooms, luxurious ambiance in the lobby, excellent customer service by happy employees (door men, front desk, house keeping staff, parking attendants) who were all eager to help. Fast elevators despite many, many people staying there for a conference. Renovated...

"Had the opportunity to stay here while in the city for a conference. Amenities are top quality. Pool and gym were amazing. Four of us were in different rooms on different floors in different areas of the hotel but every one of us had an amazing view. The bed is crazy comfortable, water pressure perfect and the desk area spacious enough for me to spread my work out. I had concerns about internet speed from other reviews but that was never an issue. Located right on the river and withing walking distance of everything we wanted to see and do!"
I am a life imePlatium member. I drove up in my rented automobile and from the moment I arrived at the doortestaffould to have been more accommodating and pleasant. I was greated by the doorman as if I was the most important person he had greeted that day. The valet service was excellent though a little expensive. I moved on to the front desk and the young woman who worked with me did everything possible to help me with the best available room on a high floor. The Club Lounge was staffed by the most friendly people a well. I would recommend this property in a second to any of my friends.
"In town for a week for a conference at McCormick. This hotel provided me all the support I needed for a busy conference schedule and precious little time to discover Chicago. The front desk and concierge staff were positive, efficient and helpful. Suggestions for restaurants and activities matched my descriptions of how much time I had and what I hoped to do exactly.The room was well kept and had a great view of the city. The pillows were phenomenal (seriously). Very comfortable room with all I needed.I will look this place up as a first choice the next time I am in town. Great location, great hotel.

"I stayed two nights for business. Check in is efficient, the location is very nice. Had a room with a view of the Navy Pier, the bed was comfortable, room was reasonable, location is very good. It's just that, for a Sheraton, you kind of expect a bit more in terms of room quality and hotel upkeep. The room is pretty dark, there was no overhead lighting, just two lamps and a desk lamp (one light over the doorway). And one thing that struck me, and this hotel is not alone here, but it was very apparent here: Food trays left in the hall. After people finish their room service meals, they put the tray out in the hall ... in this case, there was a tray out when I checked in, and it was still there late the next morning. And there were several throughout the day. Can't imagine it would cost much to hire a person to make the rounds on each floor with a cart and retrieve the trays, they make the hallways smell of burgers and food. There's nothing to hate about this hotel, but a big city Sheraton can do better than this.

"I checked in for a one night stay, the room was quiet, had a great view and was located directly on the river. Unfortunately I was there in the winter bit I am sure that in the summer I would have enjoyed this hotel a lot more. The billing department had an error on my bill which somehow my rental car was charged twice for parking. It was supposed to be in and out privileges for $49.00 per day which I didnt even use but they credited me back within 48 hours.  The only drawback was my late arrival left me very few food options after 11:00 local time.

"I rarely write reviews, but my recent experience at the Chicago Sheraton during a national conference was exceptional. A very nice desk clerk, Nia, chose a conference room for me with a beautiful view of the city. My stay was even more enjoyable because I had a clear view of the dyeing of the river for St. Patruck's Day. The concierge suggested excellent restaurants and sites to see based on my interests. The room was quiet and comfortable, and all staff members were friendly and efficient. For an enjoyable stay in Chicago, I highly recommend the Sheraton."
"Everything was great, and it gets even better when you request their assistance to enjoy the region. All the people in concierge are very kind and dedicated, but if you have the chance to talk to Marisa, your experience will not be comparable to anything you ever had. She is able to capture your expectations and point the exact places that will perfectly fit for you, a short stay in Chicago become na amazing experience. Congratulations to the hotel!! And those who are not sure where to stay, trust me, this is the right place (location, view, facilities and service).

"Took my 5 y.o. son to Chicago to visit the aquarium and museum. Arrived on Friday afternoon, valeted car (much more convenient than self park when it's cold) and had a very fast check-in. Got a room on the 14th floor next to the elevators, but never had any noise problems with either the elevator or guests.Swam for about an hour. Very nice pool, temp was just right, my kid loved it. There were about 15 other people there but it never felt too crowded.Ordered room service for dinner and my son said that the chicken strips were the best he's ever had. I had the classic burger which was pretty good.Super comfy bed, had no problem falling asleep and staying asleep.Had the breakfast buffet at LB's. Lots of selection, very nice wait staff, had a nice meal. Kids under 12 eat free.Went to the aquarium for a few hours. My boy didn't want to go to the museum, just back to the hotel for more swimming and room service. Sounds good to me!Had another nice relaxing night. We both slept like a rock.Had breakfast at LB's again and then had to head back home. My son was bummed out that we had to leave. He asked if we could move there!No, but we will be back for a Cubs game soon."
"We spent 4 nights here and loved it. It's one short block to Michigan Ave (5 minute walk) where you can catch a bus anywhere in the city or start exploring The Magnificent Mile. The navy pier is about a 10 minute walk and all your favourite stores (Whole Foods, Walgreens) are just down the street. We loved having breakfast at Yolk around the corner. We only had one issue, the hot water was temperamental but the staff were super fast and attentive to fix it when we called them - twice. I would stay here again :)"
"I have stayed at this hotel 3 times this year and it has always met all my expectations. This most recent trip last week once again was excellent. Starting with the friendly front desk agent, Britton, who made sure we got checked in quickly with a nice room although the hotel was full. She was extra friendly and helpful. Although the stay was short, I also got the opportunity to have breakfast at the club level - which was a perfect start to the day. The only negative to my Chicago visit was the adjacent restaurant - Shula's. The service was awful, the food was terrible, the manager did not care, and the bill was outrageous. I would suggest sticking to the hotel operated food options and skipping the overpriced Shula's."
"My adult son and I made a last-minute decision to spend the weekend in Chicago in mid-December. We booked this hotel en-route on the highway. The reservation department did an excellent job selling us this hotel over the Conrad. We checked into a 2 double bed with our dog and I have to say that I was disappointed in the room. It was small, or smaller than I expected it to be. The hallway leading up to the room is drab, dark and brown. The closet, bathroom, and exterior doors should be replaced as they appeared to be old and painted over numerous times. The exterior door has a gap off the floor so I had to place towels to stuff the bottom of the door. I did not like that I could hear people walking and normal tone conversation of people in the hallways.Saturday afternoon they were selling deserts in the lobby. Just a table in the lobby filled with different deserts for sale. Maybe I'm being a little prissy, but we thought it looked desperate and cheap. Even Doubletree gives out fresh warm cookies. If you want to offer deserts for sale, do it in a cafe, not in the middle of the lobby on a table. The good: Staff is excellent - except for valet. Concierge was very helpful. The front desk helped to resolve a billing issue. Our dog stayed for free, no deposits or cleaning fees. The location is excellent to restaurants and Michigan Avenue. The price was excellent. Checking out, we waited nearly 40 minutes for our vehicle. Vehicle drop-off is near the entrance, but to pick up your vehicle you need to go into the basement which is very inconvenient. I don't understand why they don't bring the vehicle to the entrance like most hotels. I would only stay again if the price was right and better options weren't available. It wasn't a bad stay, but it wasn't great either. 3 stars for the stay, an additional star for the location."
"For a trip to Chicago, the Sheraton is in an excellent location being walking distance or a bus ride away to all the main attractions Chicago has to offer. The rooms we stayed in, 3409 and 3411 had superb views of the city. Beds were comfortable and bathroom was clean. The breakfast was lovely and evening snacks were tasty. Staff at the front desk were extremely friendly and accommodating as well. Overall an enjoyable stay."
This past weekend (Dec. 27-28) my wife and I with our two young daughters stayed at the Sheridan in Chicago. We have stayed at this location twice now. We have found the location to be nicely situated for both shopping and dining. The hotel is also very nice and what we would expect from an up scale hotel.When we first arrived there was a bit of a mix up with our room but the manager went above and beyond to make sure that we were taken care of. We were very pleased with the customer service that was provided.We also wanted to mention that we met the club lounge manager Connie in the club lounge. She is a true asset to the Sheridan Chicago Hotels and Towers location. What an extremely nice and genuine individual. She made our stay that much more pleasant. Thanks Connie.We are already planning our next trip to Chicago this coming up summer and the Sheridan is where we will be staying.
"Ok,So my family and I spent 3 nights Dec 21-24th at the hotel. I'm a Lifetime SPG member and we were excited to spend a few days in Chicago in a great location. This Sheraton is close to great shopping, family advertures and restaurants.We arrived at the hotel in the early morning and as expected our room was not ready. We did a little exploring and the hotel called my cell to advise the room was ready almost 4 hours before the posted check in time, Thanks!Check in was as expected, friendly, fast and as an SPG member I was upgraded to a Suite, many thanks. Kids loved the pool and the Club lounge was great. Excellent service and beautiful view. Hotel looks like a Sheraton you would expect. Beds as comfortable as ever, hotel very clean, everyone friendly.We had room service one night and was pleasantly surprised with how good my steak was. There were 2 gotcha's to the trip however. First was the drunken idiots in the next room that kept us up. I finally called down the first night and talked to Michael the Mgr and to his credit a few minutes later there was silence. Sadly the same people were there our second night and Lisa the Mgr did the same thing and immediately took care of the noise.Full disclosure I was comped one night and also given some SPG points to make up for this without even asking, again thanks to Michael and Lisa for being pro's. The reality is a hotel can't determine which guests will be loud so I got the bad luck of the draw. The second gotcha and really a source of frustration is the full 3 days there were renovations happening at the hotel. Day 1 we were woken up at 715am by drilling and hammering. As we were on vacation and not there for an early rise business trip sleeping in did not happen.Hotel confirmed the next day reno's would not start until 9am, sadly 740am it happened, same as day 3. Biggest disappointment was front desk and reno people obviously didnt talk and set expectations on when to start.Sadly also nowhere on their hotel website site (even as of this posting) is there a notice to hotel guests of construction/renos, nor were we advised at check in. Really disappointing guys. Would have been nice to sleep in 1 of the 3 days but no luck.I think you will find this place amazing (assuming they are done reno's on your visit) and I'll give it another shot in the future. Please advise your guests in the future when doing reno's as this was a big disappointment.Take away that and you have a great hotel, great staff and a great trip. Looking forward to given this another shot in the new year, thanks everyone"
"Me and my friend Luca stayed at sheraton hotel in Chicago and we were so lucky to meet Marisa De Felice at reception. As soon as we arrived in Chicago we found ourselves in trouble because the flight company have lost our baggages.Marisa was so kind to make several calls for us and she made any effort to improve our stay at sheraton, making up for the stress we have suffered in those days.We would like to thank immensely Marisa for her support. We did appreciate her kindness and availability in such a difficult moment for us."
"Stayed at the Sheraton in Chicago for the last 4 years when I attend the CASE conference in December. To say I look forward to my stay at the Sheraton and attending this conference there is an understatement. You can't ask for a better hotel to stay at for the price, and the facilities used for the conference are perfect. Very comfortable beds, nice tv's, everything you could need you get in your room. I love how convenient everything is in the hotel. It is so easy to navigate in the conference center, and find where your sessions are. Great place to have a conference.


Room Tip: Honestly, my favorite view is of Navy Pier, but I believe I have had a room on every side and they a...

"Attended a conference held at this hotel. This was my first visit. Was impressed by the level of service provided by all members of the staff. Stayed on the club level, and found the club lounge to be quite nice, however I would say the breakfast offerings there was average. While many of the services and prices for food, parking, etc at the hotel are high, it is downtown Chicago, and you will get that no matter where you stay. Very comfortable beds, and clean and modern rooms. Would stay again."
"This visit was just as good as the last and maybe even a bit better. Our greeting by the front desk was warm & inviting. It set the tone for the next 3 days. I highly recommend this property. If you have the opportunity to book the Club Level rooms, you will be thankful that you did. The Club Lounge breakfast is great and the ability to get soda and water 24/7 is a nice feature. The complimentary wifi on this level is another great feature.The lobby is decorated for the Christmas Season and features a beautiful tree.


Room Tip: Upgrade to the Club Level. You'll be glad you did.

"My husband and I are SPG members and we visited this hotel last year and while the property was great, we had some not so welcoming service at one of hotel restraunts. I had emailed the hotel and they took care of everything almost immediatly. When we decided to return, I reached out to one of the directors, Vasileios, who upgraded our room, along with giving us club lounge access along with other accomodations. Let me say, our room was spectacular. We had a suite overlooking the city. There was a lovely bottle of wine with strawberries waiting for us. When we checked in, we were greated by Alexandra Gale who made us feel like we were so very welcome. She was just amazing. We ate at Shulas the first night and Kari provided us fabulous service. They were a little busy, but we also ate around 730pm. We ate breakfast at the Bistro and the food was really good. We were greeted and sat at a table fairly quickly. The service was top notch. The hotel is within walking distance to almost everything. Such an amazing location. My husband and I have stayed at several Sheratons between Florida, Chicago and Michigan and I have to say that the Sheraton in Chicago is our favorite. We cannot wait to come back. We are already planning our return. I refuse to stay anywhere else when we come to the city. The hospitality here is one of a kind. They truely care about their customers."
"We stay here often and are always impressed but tonight we were blown away by two employees in the club level. We just checked in today and are here for a few nights but this review is for the club level service we received dec 20 sat. Jorge, I think F&B manager and Connie Alex were the 2 employees we saw. Starting at 5 the club level was so packed and these 2 seamlessly took care of the hordes people lining up to get the appetizers. Like I said this is our go to hotel and we have never seen so many people at once. We have seen Connie before and she always makes everyone feel welcome. She is a gem to the hotel. We always encounter great employees here but after seeing how they handled this I needed to leave a review for them. I recommend upgrading while at this property always worth it!"
"My professional association, the Illinois State Bar Association, has conducted its annual mid-year meeting for decades at the Sheraton. I've come to know staff from the doorman to the bellman to the servers in the bar. It's a comfortable place, close to just about anything in Chicago. The rooms are well appointed, functional. Whether it's either a large, professional meeting or simply a week-end getaway to the Windy City, the Sheraton Hotel & Towers should be in ones travel plans.

"My Wife and I just celebrated our 49th Wedding Anniversary and we usually spend a few days Downtown every year enjoying all the Christmas decorations. We always stay at the Sheraton Chicago Hotel and Towers (we always ask for a room with a ""River View"") and the Sheraton Again treated us like Royalty. Everyone from the Doorman to the nice person that kept our room neat were just SUPER. The Front Desk Crew were outstanding as always. Thank You Again for a Wonderful visit."
"I had the opportunity to stay at the Sheraton Towers from Dec. 3-8 for a Dental Implant Conference. First, the location of the hotel was primo. Easy walking distance to many fine restaurants, shopping, and Chicago must see locations (John Hancock Bldg, Water Tower, etc.). Check-in was easy, friendly, and the lobby was nicely decorated for the Christmas. Our room was not ready, but they handled our luggage and provided access to the lounge. Our room was top notch. We were on the 35 floor and had a great view of the lake and the Navy pier. The room was inviting and comfortable. Plenty of room to spread out, work at the desk, or just watch TV. No problem sleeping on those beds-very comfortable! Everyone we encountered at the hotel was very helpful, especially the doorman. He provided many excellent dining recommendations and directions. The concierge was also very helpful, but usually busier than the doorman. The restaurants provided excellent choices and the food was very good! Better than one expects from many hotels. I was a repeat offender and enjoyed each meal. The bar was centrally located with an excellent wine list. I had reservations for another meeting at the Swissotel midweek, but cancelled them to stay at the Sheraton and walk to the other hotel for the meeting. Being a Gold Member at the Marriott and Hilton Hotels, I was skeptical about staying at the Sheraton. No more! I will make the Sheraton my hotel of choice in Chicago. Thanks to everyone who made our visit exceptional. Cannot wait to return."
"I have to disagree with the reviewer who said they were not treated well because they do not have a wealthy look. I'm far from wealthy or wealthy looking (I got a great deal on Priceline), and when I walked in I felt a little intimidated (even though I've stayed in upscale hotels before). But the man who checked me in couldn't have been nicer. Even though I was a ""discount"" guest he allowed me to check in early without me even asking and gave me a room with a lovely view overlooking the river.Another plus for a budget-conscious traveler is that they offer a $5/night voucher if you don't have your room made up. I like to conserve resources so I don't want my sheets changed every day anyway, so getting paid for what I would do anyway was a nice bonus. I used the voucher in their internet cafe, which has excellent pastries. The beds were really comfortable; the bathroom was a bit small, though, and not as luxurious as I would expect for this level hotel.The location really can't be beaten, with the Loop one block in one direction, the ""Miracle mile"" one block another direction and a view of the river.I would avoid the Shula's steakhouse, however -- everything was really salty!"
As a Platinum member I was upgraded to a great room with an amazing view and I received very good service. Their are so many great hotels in Chicago and now this one is on my list.Pros: - Clean and comfortable rooms - Many with amazing views - Very old service for the size of the hotel - Good location - Room service was promptCons: - This hotel is large and can have a lot of guests - That can create longer lines at checkin
"I have stayed at this hotel before but I have never experienced the level of customer service that I had until this particular trip. I really appreciated being given a late check-out, it just helps so much sometimes to be given that extra hour or two. I also asked about parking and was told I could park on property until 3 p.m. the next day with no further charges. I needed a couple of extra hours of parking (I didn't want to have to move the car) and the front desk manager took care of it for me. IT IS THE LITTLE THINGS sometimes that matter in customer service. Also love the fact that this hotel has a shower gel and a loofah for the tub/bath."
"We recently attended (and sponsored) an annual industry conference at the Chicago Sheraton. This 3-day conference consumes the entire property (1209 hotel rooms) and they do not miss a beat. We require one of their largest spaces (2442 sq. ft.) for our client meetings/hospitalty suite for 2 full days of non-stop F&B. Their staff is excellent! They consistenty check to make sure you have everything you need/want from refreshing hot coffee and all beverages to removing the dirty dishes, etc. Their pre-conference communication is much appreciated and always accurate when ordering F&B in advance. The hotel rooms are nice as is the workout facility. Restaurant on site are all very good as well.Walking distance to Michigan Ave. shopping and many of the top-notch restaurants Chicago has to offer. If you ever need a place for an event, give them a try. You won't be disappointed."
"This hotel is too big for it's own good. Customer service is impersonal at best. Just herding cattle. When I received my bill by e-mail there were multiple charges that I did not incur. It took almost an hour of being on hold and protesting in order to receive a correction. DO NOT LEAVE THIS PROPERTY UNTIL YOU HAVE CAREFULLY REVIEWED YOUR BILL! There are far more convenient and economic alternatives for hotels in Chicago. The facility itself is quite nice, but that's about it.

"We stayed on Thanksgiving and Black Friday. Room rate was very reasonavle at $106 per night. Check in was pleasant, the host was very polite and friendly and accomodating. Room was nice, beds were comfy but I did not feel I was treated as a valued guest. The concierge chose to help someone who walked right up rather than myself who was waiting in the line, the bell hopper was very short in answering my questions and quickly moved on to another guest he must have known. We were charged for items we ""touched"" but did not consume and after three email bills I am hoping it is corrected and on our final day, room service was knocking on the door at 8:50am to clean. Why did they ask my check-out time when I checked in if they had no intentions of using it?! I really just felt like because I did not have the ""wealthy look"" that I was overlooked and not treated as a valued guest. However, they should know that those 'well-off' come in all different shapes and sized and not everyone chooses to flaunt it! I would choose to stay elsewhere next time specifically due to not feeling as if I were treated as a value guest."
"Stayed in the city for the big Thanksgiving Day parade. I was really impressed with this hotel, especially considering the rate we got. Very clean, fresh feeling and in a great location to access Michigan Ave, the river and even Navy Pier. When you book, they may contact you to ask if you want the concierge package (or club package) for an extra $29. Do it. Access to the club room on the 33rd floor is worth it. You can actually use it for breakfast, 24 access to beverages and even good snacks each evening. You can book a room on 32 or 34 and have access via stairs. If you are a Sheraton ""member"" you can even get a 4:00pm checkout time which is great for another jaunt into the streets before you check out. I also appreciated having a ""self park"" option to save a few dollars. Another perk of the upgrade? Free wifi!


Room Tip: Not sure you can go wrong, we were on 33 on the river side and very happy.

"I stayed at the Sheraton Chicago Hotel and Towers for business reasons downtown Chicago, early November 2014. Well, in a nutshell, nothing to say in the way of criticism. Not that I'm afraid of hotel backlash - I've been critical on other occasions. But simply, there isn't much against the Sheraton to make it a premier venue in Chicago. It's huge with quality everywhere.The room was fairly large, considering it was a standard room, not business or executive. Not on the lake side though, I was on the city side, but it was splendid nevertheless. That particular place in Chicago has those gothic skycraper tops with gargoyles and arches and steeples, very illuminated at night, it all has an eerie Gotham city touch. Gotta see it to believe it. The window provides a huge end-to-end vista on that theatrical scenery, so I left the curtains wide opened. I rarely do that.Room is clean and spacious, with all the bells and whistles that befit an upscale US grand hotel. Which I never use (ironing board, espresso coffee maker, hair dryer, huge flat TV, 2,345 pillows, safe, shampoo with 65 minerals vitamins, hundreds of towels, you name it). Although the hotel was filled to near capacity, as it was host to a gigantic translators' convention, elevators were swift, apparently all working. Worth mentioning, as I hate to wait for elevators.The hotel is huge -- I was on 23rd floor I believe -- so expect a little congestion at registration or check-out time. Apart from that, everything is fast. You're dead center in Chicago, on that river.Airport ride is about 45$. 40 minutes outside rush hours. They have shuttles (""limousines"" dem say) too.


Room Tip: Lake view is the splurge, go for it if you can!

"Nothing too personal about this place. A huge hotel. Rooms are dated, but how could they redo them, there are so many? The Lobby is gigantic with the hotel store on the far side of it. The rooms at the top, on the Club Floor, are much nicer than the normal rooms, but mine faced right out onto the hotel cooling towers, which were noisy. No way to drowned those monsters out. Beds were fine, nothing great. The rooms on the river side looking towards the city have spectacular views from the middle of the hotel on up, I would guess. Close to Michigan Ave. Stay here if you have no other choice but are better hotels in town."
"The Sheraton Chicago Towers is well-located along the river, with good views from all directions, including of the river, cityscapes and peaks at Lake Michigan. The rooms are well-appointed, though not very spacious for the room rate. The beds are comfortable, with big heavy comforters and lighter comforters underneath, so whatever you prefer is available.
Like many city hotels, there...

"The customer service at this hotel is delightful. The doorman was very welcoming as we exited our vehicle. Adam at Check In was more than accommodating. He noticed my request for extra pillows and asked if I would prefer feathered pillows. When he found out I was in town for the Hot Chocolate Race he offered us a 1pm check out which I gladly accepted. He even gave me a coupon for a free drink and snack at the hotel. Thank you so much Adam for your hospitality. As we entered our very clean room with lots of pillows we were thrilled with the beautiful view of the river and the park down below, the lake to our left and the buildings which were so beautifully lit at night. The next morning after our race the staff gave us information so we could get a cart sent to our room for our bags. The sweetest man came to our room with the cart and brought it down for us as well as helping us get to our valet parking. This hotel really understands customer service and I will most definitely stay again. By the way, the beds were very comfortable and halls were quiet. I slept like a baby. It is also located near shopping, Navy Pier, Michigan Avenue, architecturally significant buildings and the architectural tour (which I highly recommend) and not far from Millennium Park."
"I traveled with a co worker for 3 nights/ 4 days for a conference held at the hotel. The rooms were clean and nice but a little small. The shower water pressure was very good! Although it almost hurt if you stayed in too long. The view from our room (1431) was wonderful! We had a full view of the river and even Lake Michigan off in the distance. The conference rooms were nice and the escalators made it easy to get from floor to floor because it seemed like everything was on a different floor. The only complaint I have is that I don't like the refrigerator in the room that is full of beverages for purchase. We had no room to keep our personal soda or water. And the ice bucket they provided was too small to use to keep our drinks cold. Overall the staff was friendly and the service we received was good. We also enjoyed our breakfast from the cafe there in the morning. Although service was a little slow the food was delicious! If I were to come again I may stay right on Michigan Ave, instead of a few streets over, since that is where we spent most of our free time."
"Just a short thank you note to Rhea Alejo - I travel to Chicago quite frequently due to business and have the choice between a very nice Westin on Magnificient Mile, the two W's or even another Westin in River North. The Sheraton Chicago Hotel and Towers has always exceeded my expectations and you have contributed to that. I will continue to book this hotel due to the warm hospitality you have shown me. Apart from the fantastic amenities you offer (Lounge, great Bar, great restaurant), it is associated like you who make this hotel one of choice, especially for SPG members.Thank you!"
"Lobby is big, exciting, warm and inviting. If you live in New York, LA or Michigan you will enjoy the property. The front desk staff was warm and the wait time to get to the desk was instant. Amsale Kassa could not have been more perfect checking us in, her smile matched the hotels overall feel. Thank you Starwood for ensuring my visit to Chicago was perfect especially as it was my husbands birthday weekend!"
"Booked five rooms for a group going to see Notre Dame in South Bend making Chicago our home base for the weekend. As a group we all are SPG members but all of us did not receive upgraded rooms to the club level very disappointing especially since being a member the longest pushed my group to enroll and choose this hotel. The location is prime for the river walk and grant park, mag. mile, navy pier, excellent location. The hotel is very large and quite often is booked with conventions so it is very busy. The concierge desk are staffed with more than one person and do an excellent job, the valet guys are very friendly and excellent at directions and tips on where to go. Check in was smooth for me as Galen immediatley recognized me as loyal spg member and upgraded me to a club level room extending us a late check out as needed for our group. The room was clean and well appointed and the view up river from the 32 floor looking at the beautiful trump tower was magnificent. Only issue we had was and it was very disappointing was the adjacent room was full of loud teenage girls and mean loud you could hear them down the hall as we approached our room, of course you can imagine when we got into our room how loud and disturbing it was. The only visit from security didn't have the impact we had hoped as the rest of the night was a nightmare and of course no sleep. The whole next day I was a zombie. Overall I highly recommend this hotel for its location and excellent staff minus the security team of course. Thanks Sheraton we will be coming back for our next trip in the summer.

"First time in Chicago and we spent three days at this hotel. It is located along the 'River Walk' close to the architectural cruise ports and only a 5-min walk to the 'Magnificent Mile' packed with high-end shopping and restaurants. Key highlights include:Pros- Location, location, location- Amazing view of downtown Chicago from virtually every angle of the hotel; definitely ask for a room on a high floor- One of the best fitness centers with, again, incredible ceiling-to-floor windows overlooking the River Walk and a spacious yet enclosed balcony for outdoor yoga during the right season- If it's a beautifuld day outside and you don't want to exercise indoors, the River Walk is only steps awayCons- Because it is a central hotel, it is quite a long trek from Chicago O'Hare International Airport. Traffic adds to the meter and it seems like there's always traffic. Avg. taxi fare one way is $55+. If you can find alternate transportation, recommend you do.- Customer service was not as hospitable as other hotels of comparable chains. We sampled most services offered in the hotel from check-in, concierge, valet, bell hop, guest room, FedEx and more. The hotel greeters and concierge desk were the most hospitable - friendly and patient with questions. All other services were unfriendly/curt, sometimes impatient with questions. - The rooms are dated and of subpar quality; the view helped me overlook these I'm not a high-maintenance traveller so I'm open to overlooking the cons and appreciating the pros. However, I rate customer service very high on my list as an important experience and this hotel has some improvements to make in this area to help make guests feel welcomed."
"The Swisshotel rooms follow a familiar layout for anyone who travels for business. The only really notable items in the room are the very expensive water and the rather good coffee maker. After that it's TV, bed, and working area - although it also has to be said that the easy chair in the room is pretty comfortable too. An iDock is beside the bed. The bathroom is fine, shower is good, and everything seemed clean. The wi-fi was so-so and didn't work for 2 of the 6 days I stayed due to a DNS problem with the provider. The hotel should do better for $14.95 a day, a ridiculous rate in today's environment when free wi-fi is becoming the norm. Food in the Palm restaurant is fine and a small shop is on site for essentials - but you'd be better off going to the CVS around the corner. Good access to the Magnificent Mile and the Chicago river and close enough to the Blue Line train from O'Hare too. All in all, a reasonable place to stay in the Windy City."
"I have been staying at the Swiss for years, and although it has slightly dropped since being sold to a Japanese firm, it is still a very good hotel to stay at. The views are still great, but were even better before many of the new buildings began to be built around the area. The view of the lake or river is not obstructed though, so its not much of a concern. They offer a great pool/gym area, as well as a fine restaurant in the Palms, located within the lobby. The service is also very good, and the beds are better than many other hotels. Overall, this is a good place to stay. Comfortable and luxurious, without the somewhat tacky elegance of places like the Ritz.


Room Tip: Try and get a room facing the lake or river, the views are great!

Green Features: They have done a good job updating their policies to be more green."
I checked into the Swissotel for two night for a business meeting. Check in was easy and friendly. The elevators are a bit different in that you punch your floor number in and there are no buttons on the inside which is a nice touch. Room was clean and well appointed. I found the staff to be courteous. The fitness facility is very nice and overlooks the lake with some high rises dotting the view. Overall highly recommended.
"Attended a business conference there for 2 nights. Overall hotel is not impressive. Tired carpeting throughout. Conference rooms are small and in basement. AV help was slow not always working. Bed sheets, mattress and pillows are old or of poor quality. Can't open windows in bedroom. On good side: food was decent, staff was friendly, bathroom and room were a good size. Would not choose to stay there again."
"The hotel was nicely located in Downtown Chicago and also close to Navy Pier. There was plent of shopping, places to eat, and entertainment nearby. The staff was friendly and helpful. We upgraded our room to a king with a city view. It was well worth the upgrade for the bed and the view. The Keurig in the room was a very nice touch. The only complaint I have is that we found hair in our bed both nights we stayed. I had hoped that a hotel of this caliber would have paid attention to that small detail.

"It can be tough to find a decent hotel in downtown Chicago that is relatively close to everything, is moderately priced and is pleasant and clean...Swissotel is one of those few.The staff is friendly and attentive, and you experience a cool, hip vibe the moment you walk in. (Speaking of walking, you are close enough to walk to Chicago's premier shopping area, ""the Miracle Mile"".)The design is a bit contemporary, clean and fun.Good drinks at their bar, good food at their cafe and they always seem to have a few rooms left, again, for a fair price, when everyone else seems to be sold out.Many go for the major chains and names, but do yourself a favor next time and give Swissotel a try; you won't be disappointed!"
"I had called Swisshotel to request a roll a way for my room. When I arrived at the hotel Chenge, at the front desk, said they could not put a roll a way in the room as it is a fire hazard. I was not happy. HOWEVER, he then gave us a suite with beautiful views of Chicago for exactly the same price. I live in the MIddle East and went to Chicago to spend time with my three kids who were flying in from all over the USA. The Swisshotel's service and friendliness made our time together memorable and enjoyable. I am now a big fan of the Swisshotel. They also have fresh flavored water in the lobby which we all loved after spending time walking around Chicago!"
"Not only does the Swissotel have a great location with views of the river and lake and walking distance to the Art Institute and the Miracle Mile shops and restaurants, but it has all those ""touches"" that make for a great stay: Spacious rooms with a fridge, plush robes, ample desk for working, quiet with wonderful views, elevators that are fast (you enter your floor # before boarding); the pool is large enough for laps; and, the staff is attentive and polished. What more could you want?

"Yes, Chicago is a city of skyscrapers but this hotel is levels above most others. First, the Swissotel Chicago has a convenient location for walking and visiting but it also has stunning views of the water and the city. There is a great swimming pool and exercise room on Floor 42 that makes you feel like you are soaring in the clouds.The rooms are very comfortable and thoughtfully laid out and very clean.The service is efficient, friendly and puts the customer first. The hotel is a strong proponent of going green and also offers free wi-fi for all. Finally, the restaurants are of the highest caliber and offer a nice variety, though a bit pricey. The Swissotel is my choice in Chicago!"
Have to disagree... Decent view but that's where it ends for me. Not accommodating to business travelers.... No mini bar/snacks in room. Must stand in line at bar or check in to get a soda/snack. Just to have someone charge to your room. Hotel rooms are outdated. Wallpaper and paint peeling in my room. Love the room service guys! Quicker than visiting the restaurants or the ever so inconvenient 24/7.
"You cannot beat the location of this hotel by the river and at walking distance from the lake, the loop, shopping, dining, architectural tours, etc. As there is a taxi stop right in front of the hotel, you do not need to worry about transportation regardless of the time of your flight. Customer service was wonderful! The room was clean and tastefully decorated--black-and-white photos of Chicago added an artistic touch which tends to be missing. It did not hurt that we had a view of the river and the lake! I hate to take away points from such a beautiful hotel, but the bed and pillows could have been somewhat more comfortable--unless you enjoy a hard mattress. If you have back issues, you may want to ask to see the room (and check out the bed) before you settle down."
"The location is the best feature of this hotel, the elevators are the second best feature! I have stayed here a couple of times in the last six months and the service has been the same each time: parking valets are fabulous, service desk is slow but adequate, bar is decent. Don't show up to the breakfast buffet close to closing -- they won't let you in even if it's a few minutes before they actually close. (We ended up going to Beef & Brandy which was a great place to eat.) Like most nicer downtown hotels, everything (like wifi, water, etc.) will cost you extra, so be prepared. We stayed in a suite every time, and the view was great. The layout of the rooms and bathrooms made the space very functional. Overall nice hotel.

"We arrived as refugees from a missed Amtrak connection (NOT Amtrak's fault, btw, someone laid down in the track ahead of our train...caused a sad 5 hour delay), exhausted and not knowing what to expect. This is the only swissotel in this country, and we are hoping for more! Our room was on the 38th floor, with a sweeping view of Lake Michigan and the Navy Pier - awesome at night with their ferris wheel. The room was spacious, immaculate, and the king-size bed was perfectly comfortable. Next morning, we ventured up to their exercise facility, and found a wonderfully huge facility on the top floor, floor to ceiling windows, again overlooking Lake Michigan, with numerous machines (I loved using the elliptical while feeling like I was flying!) AND a sauna afterward (no view in the sauna, and, no, it didn't matter!). Swissotel definitely has its priorities straight. Very highly recommended!

"I throughly enjoyed staying at the Swissotel due to the customer service! I had an issue with the exhast in my bathroom and an engineer was sent right away to fix it. The next day the front desk called to see if I was okay with the room and if I wanted to change rooms, which I didn't. The conceirge was very helpful and friendly. He seemed to remember me each time I asked him for a resturant recommendation and then would ask about my eating experience the next day."
"We stayed at this beautiful hotel by chance. Booked on hotwire. Our room was beautiful, the bed was amazingly comfortable. We walked to across the street to the boat tours and Riverwalk. Walked comfortably to the theater. Funny to say but the elevator system is unique and efficient. The building itself was mentioned on the architectural boat tour. Bar and restaurant were good. The only drawback I have to mention was when we checked in. For a minute I thought I was in an episode of the Gilmore Girls - the French accented guy checking us in was condescending and rude. He was out of place with the rest of the atmosphere which is generally outstanding and very customer oriented. We'd definitely go back.


Green Features: They give a discount if you skip housekeeping and reuse your towels."
"Good central location, I stayed for 6 nights. Enjoyed a large twinbed room. Liked the fact that aircondition was directed away from beds, that I had a large table and good view from the 16th floor overlooking parts of the lake to the south. Nice breakfast, helpful staff and my general high expectations was fulfilled. Only minus was TV not working properly. nor much of a minus, I did not even bring it to the attention of the staff. If. 4.5 score would have been possible, that would be the exact score from this review."
"Considering the location, the price and what the photos looked like on the internet, I was expecting a really nice downtown high-rise. What I got was a great location in a decent hotel in need of a lot of TLC. Some of the furniture in my room was really beat up - like damaged wood and damaged upholstery. I'm not talking about faded wood or dings in the wood or worn leather upholstery. I'm talking gouged portions of wood with obvious markings where the stain/finish came off. I'm talking about tears in the leather. The door to my shower did not close properly because a hinge needed to be replaced. These things certainly did not ruin my experience, just served as a reminder that this hotel really is just a little lacking of what I expected. Staff was really nice. Wifi stunk."
Great hotel in a great city. Rooms were clean and spacious. In great location right on the river. Near parks and shopping on Michigan ave. Hotel is connected to the pedway which connects to other hotels underground this can be convenient for parking and if the weather is bad. I got a discounted parking voucher from click n park at the Aqua parking garage which saved me a lot. Strongly recommended.
"We went on a weekend trip to Chicago for my husband's birthday. We found this hotel through Hotwire and was amazed at what it came with. Both my husband and I travel quite often and must admit that the amenities the hotel had and the kindness of the hotel staff is phenomenal. The amenities included a coffee machine, coffee and refrigerator. While most hotel rooms have a coffee machine, rarely do they have refrigerators - especially in touristy areas.. We were able to buy water and etc. outside of the hotel and keep them cool in the refrigerator. The room was clean and the view of the navy pier was nice. The kindness of the staff must not be forgotten. They remembered my husband's birthday and sent us a complimentary champagne platter. The front desk staff were very knowledgeable and did everything to make our stay here awesome. As for the location, it is convenient to walk to the Navy Pier and if you enjoy walking a bit further, the aquarium and museum are not too far of a walk. The hotel is also located near cool eateries. I highly recommend Swissotel.


Green Features: It is a green hotel! No smoking and they give you a credit when you don't use room service- saving towels and water."
"I attended a conference at the Swissotel last week. The conference organizer warned participants ahead of time that the hotel management said that WiFi worked in the rooms, but was very unreliable in the rest of the hotel (!). This seems insane for a contemporary hotel. Sure enough, presenters who needed internet access for their presentations had to get a log-in before the talk and then log out instantly so other presenters could log on. Swissotel personnel assured me that tech help would be available in each room before the panel presentations -- an hour before my presentation, when my log in didn't work and I needed help, I was told that there only two techs -- and one of them had gone home. A model of Swiss efficiency this hotel is not!I was also surprised at the treatment I received from the staff of this four-star hotel.When I asked where to register, I was greeted with a cold stare and a terse reply.After one of the sessions on our floor, I wandered into a room that had a bar set up, thinking it was for our conference attendees. Instantly (Swiss efficiency) a man asked me what I was doing there. He then said, ""There are more than one conference here. You do not belong!"" I recommend that conference organizers steer clear of this hotel. I now think of the Swissotel as ""Swiss hostile."""
"Located in downtown with all major hotels and shopping malls around. Due to cold weather I could not go much outside but enjoyed staying inside the hotel. Warm welcome by check in staff's, specially the door man was very attentive and helpful. Without being asked, he offered his assistance to give direction for shopping malls and side seen. View from the room was great, I was enjoying looking at the river and sea from my room.Comfortable beds, most of the international tv channels were available.Overall, I can recommend anyone to stay."
The Swiss is a great hotel in downtown Chicago. We really enjoyed the whole experience of staying there except the dining options in the hotel. Most of Chicago's great hotels have great restaurants on site which the Swiss didn't.  The location is great for shopping or visiting Millenium Park. You are in the middle of it all.  I could not give it 5 stars because of the dining options but I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone.
"I would recommend this hotel. Rooms were nice. They are a little dated, but are in no way in shambles. The beds are very comfortable, the views are great, and the bathroom is above average. Be prepared, as everything in this area of the city, really the city in general, is expensive. That being said, you can get to the museums, shopping, restaurants, etc., all very easily with a $10 or less cab. I would of given this a 5 star review if it wasn't for the pool area that left something to be desired. (I visited with kids) You wont be disappointed and the really negative reviews are off base."
"This is the second Swissotel I have stayed in. The other was Sir Stamford Raffles in Singapore. The Singapore hotel is outstanding. My review of the Chicago hotel will be ongoing during my current stay. Checked in late last night and everything went smoothly. My room was ready and clean. It's got a fantastic view of the Navy Pier. I did ask for strawberries and champagne for my arrival, but I found champagne and an anniversary cupcake when I arrived. It wished me all the best on my non-existent anniversary. No big deal though seeing as the cupcake was delicious. The bathroom is what I would expect for a hotel of this class. The walls are a little thin though and I can hear my neighbors so that is something to keep in mind. I'm here for five days so I will update later. Paul W."
"I will start with the positives: The beds are very comfortableThe view from the corner king rooms is great The room, lobby, etc are very hip and well decoratedThe bath products were decent I would put the general feel and look of the hotel on par with other 4 star hotelsThe location was pretty good (about a 5-10 min walk from the Magnificent Mile) Now the negatives:Our room did not have heat and it was well below freezing outside. We complained twice and was not offered a new room for over 6 hours after checking in. It was literally 48 degrees in our room when we were finally given a new room. It was Valentine's Day and the hotel was near capacity, so we were given the exact same room, despite being forced to switch rooms at 10:30 pm (it was a higher floor). Given that it was a special night, we did not make a big deal of it with management, although he did offer to adjust the rate to $199 (the original price was $279). The next morning, upon checkout, we were told that the best they could do was a 25% discount for us (that does not add up to the price agreed upon the night before). At this point, the counter staff acted as if she was doing us a favor by giving us a room with heat and said there was nothing more they would do for us. What is most upsetting about this situation is not that the room didn't have heat, as we understand that things happen. It was that the hotel did not make an effort to right this wrong, and the general service and attitude was very poor. Other negatives:Dust bunnies in the air ventTowel had large (12 inch in diameter) hole in itNo free internet (typical, but still annoying) Champagne offered in the date night package is actually two glasses of Prosecco at the barTook more than two calls to get us removed from a 48 degree roomThe hotel needs to work on their service and general attitude towards their customers."
"I've stayed at the Swissotel countless times. It's a welcoming place with contemporary-style rooms that offer beautiful to spectacular views of Lake Michigan and the North River. The views of the lake used to be even more expansive until they built the Raddison Blue Hotel nearby but that's life in major urban area. The rooms are exceptionally spacious and airy and the bedding is sumptuous. There is a great workspace and a sitting area and plenty of outlets for devices. Coffee makers are included in each room and we often get breakfast included. I first began staying there with with my husband because we have family and friends in the city and the Swissotel offered a government employee rate we couldn't beat. We've subsequently become Swissotel members and get fantastic upgrades when we stay depending on the time of year. We almost always get moved to a large corner room with excellent views of the city but we've also been given suites for the price of a king room which are luxuriously spacious and sumptuous. The staff is wonderfully responsive and the hotel is located just off Michigan Ave but also tucked away from noise. If it's shopping you want, you can pop down to Nordstrom or the other high end shops along Michigan Ave. in minutes and if you want a serene walk on the banks of Lake Michigan, you're there in less than than ten minutes with a lovely walk down the North River until you get there. Restaurants abound in this area and you can have your pick of places within a short jaunt of the hotel. We like to eat at the bar if we want something on the lighter side. The hotel has its own restaurant but you can find most of the main dishes at the very open bar without a wait and the wine list is extensive. Service is tops. Then back up to your room for steamy shower or a soak before you turn in for the night. The bathrooms are solid--they have tubs and showers--nice to have a choice. Parking on site is available and the staff make every effort to bring your car to the front quickly but it's very pricey. If you don't need constant access to your car, there are garages a block or so down that offer parking for half the price. There's a new Whole Foods that's being completed a hop, skip and jump away if you feel like buying sandwiches etc for your dinner or lunch and the Art Institute is a beautiful walk from the hotel in the warm weather. My husband and I took advantage of a deal the Fairmont (which is down the street) was offering about a month ago since it's supposed to be a more upscale hotel and we stayed there overnight. Compared to the Swissotel, the rooms were tiny and not well appointed. The bed was too soft and the views were non-existent. We won't make that mistake again. And we'll continue staying at the Swissotel the next time we visit Chicago."
"Nice hotel for the price you pay. This seems to be more of a business hotel you're charged for everything. Wifi, wine glasses, you name it there's a charge. I visited this hotel for my first trip ever to Chicago on my birthday. I was sort of expecting something thoughtful or made up by the staff since they knew of the occasion but I was sadly mistaken. The hotel is nice, staff is nice and so are the rooms. I will probably come back here just not for memorable moments because unfortunately they don't believe in those."
"I decided to stay downtown Chicago for New Year's eve and booked a room at the Swissotel. The lobby was very nice...Modern, bustling with activity, a bit loungy(not a real word I know) but once I got to the room, I was not impressed. I received a corner room which was shaped very awkward and with so many windows, it was very cold. Unfortunately the only view I had is of some buildings around it and a roof with ice puddles, but considering the time of year I was not expected a spectacular view for the price I paid. The decor was decent and the room was clean but nothing to write home about. It also seemed to lack more modern amenities. I was also not impressed with the food from room service. The personnel were pleasant and helpful and I always appreciate that. I'm not sure I would ever stay there again but you could do a lot worse in the city in a pinch.


Room Tip: If you want a view, make sure you get a room on a high floor. Corner rooms in winter may be cold due...

"I used to stay at this property 4-6 times per year from 2002-2008. Back then, it was a perfect hotel. The Executive Lounge was the best in the city, in my opinion, and the fitness center and pool area was great. It was a wonderful experience - fabulous views, great rooms with nice amenities and very good services from the lounge. Then, my schedule changed and I did not have the same opportunity to be in downtown Chicago. I went back one time in 2010 and the lounge was closed for ""renovations"" and the service was terrible, so I avoided the property until just last week - January 2015.How sad to have had a perfectly HORRIBLE visit last week. First, the executive lounge is totally gone. This takes away the convenience of breakfast in the lounge. I was more than happy to pay the upcharge for the lounge for this convenience of water available all the time and breakfast available quickly and easily in the lounge. It's a huge hassle to go down to the basement location for breakfast, and it's a crummy breakfast downstairs. The executive lounge also used to have appetizers from 5-7pm which was nice, given that dinner is often late in Chicago. If they closed the lounge due to the cost of alcohol, it seems silly - all they had to do was change policy to make a charge for alcohol. I'm sure they had challenges with people drinking too much when it was free. It's not unusual to charge for liquor (Fairmont Club and Sheraton Club charge for it, and I'm fine with that). It's just such a shame to lose that.On top of closing the lounge, the hotel feels shabby and low-end. The rooms are dirty now with really tired carpet and furnishings. The in room amenities are non-existent. A bottle of water is $8 and the bathroom amenities are also really shabby and low-value. It's some non-brand and you can barely get one shampooing from the tube of yucky shampoo. The fitness area is also dirty and the equipment is old and tired. It used to be a $10/day upcharge to use the fitness, and stuff was in much better shape then. I'd rather pay and have it be nice.In general, it feels like they are not at all happy to see you and the attitude is that the guest is getting a privilege to be allowed to stay at the hotel - not the other way around. This is not typical of the Swissotel chain. In the other locations, it's a fabulous luxury hotel with the executive lounge and great fitness area and superior customer service and attitudes. In Chicago, it's about on par with a Motel 6. Maybe Motel 6 is better. It's full of drunken young business people who crowd the tiny bar in the lobby and spread out into the hallways. Two nights in a row, I had screaming drunk people outside my room - on a Tuesday and Wednesday night stay! These are young business travelers on expense accounts acting like total idiots. Is this really what you wanted, Swissotel?They lowered the price and must have negotiated with company travel departments to be a business destination at a low price. It was $299/night back in the early 2000s and now it's much less and - you get much less for it.In doing so, they ruined this hotel as a vacation destination. It's not good for families with the insane prices for services (water, parking, breakfast), and it's not good for couples looking for a luxury experience (no executive lounge, really run-down spa area) and it's very average on all other dimensions. Seriously - it has turned into a Holiday Inn, at higher prices and much worse service. It's been totally ruined. SHAME SHAME SHAME, Swissotel.Don't go here if you remember the old luxury Swissotel. You will be so disappointed."
"My wife and I recently stayed here for our Anniversary. We have stayed at several high end hotels downtown Chicago in the past Raddison Blu, W, etc. The woman who checked us in was wonderful probably the highlight of the stay. Maybe it was just the room we had but it was like a nice super 8 except, no microwave. It was our Anniversary and at most hotels of this caliber they ask if there is a special occasion complimentary bottle of wine etc. No one even asked here. The Worse part of the entire place was ""MUSE"" I believe it was called.... The staff at the bar was actually rude to us and ignored us for a good 5 minutes while they talked about personal things very loudly right in front of us. Finally we ordered 2 coronas for about $17 than I had to ask if they even served food he said yeah than went back to the staff conversation than ignored us again. Finally my wife wanted to move away to a table just to stop listening to the conversation they were having as if we werent even there. So we grabbed our things, coats, drinks etc. Some other random man walked by so I just mentioned we were taking a table. He said ok, did you have food coming? I said we wished I wanted to order about 10 minutes ago. So one of the group stopped talking and asked what do you want to eat.... litterally! I said Mushrooms and Gnochi. He said ok Ill put in the order. Than we sat all of our stuff at the table without even an offer of any assistance. We pretty much finished our drinks no one asked if we would like another, than finally the food came out. I said thank you and asked the server where she was from to be friendly and because her accent was familiar and my wife is from Russia and was curious as well she said slovia and walked away like in the middle of my sentance. Than we got our $50 bill for 2 beers we finished long ago and 2 mini sized apps. We dont care how much it costs because in places like this, your paying for you good time and great expierence which I felt we were deffinetly robbed of. So all in all, if you have never been to an upper class or botique hotel perhaps you wouldn't mind the place because ignorance is bliss. But if you do know better deffinetly find out if they have any better rooms than what we stayed in and DO NOT GO anywhere near Muse."
"My husband and I stayed here the night before the Chicago blizzard and we could not have asked for a better stay. We got the Shedd Aquarium Package and I highly recommend getting this package. We called ahead and got our tickets for the day around noon and we given a free upgrade to corner room where we could see Navy Pier one way and more of the Chicago river and Trump Tower the other way. Our package also came with free breakfast buffet which was amazing, especially because I am 5 months pregnant. :) Speaking of that night we got drinks at Amuse, the bar downstairs and the bartender was more than happy to make me a virgin drink of my choice :) Great room, bed, shower, bath, pool, breakfast, staff esp. Amy, great everything.


Room Tip: Get a corner room for great views!!

Green Features: There was a recycle bin in our room and the option not to have our sheets changed if we were staying more than one night."
"We stayed here me and my wife and we were given high floor room with city and navy pear view.We loved it. Only bad this was the parking which was about $65 a day!There is a lot of things that you can do around. It is walking distance to millennium park and the famous shipping stores on Michigan Avenue!


Room Tip: Ask for high floor and check the nearby parking facilty.

Green Features: Very friendly and welcoming. Was offered a nice room!"
"Stayed at the Swissotel for six nights. The room on the 31st floor was spacious, quiet and well designed. My stay was associated with a business conference so I needed to work in the evenings and over the weekend on presentations and notes. The Internet service was just tolerable (except for some peak times when it was terrible) and it was very expensive ... $25/day for ""high speed"" 7Mb/s service. I was also very disappointed to find that the hotel has no real business center. Instead, they rely on a small UPS store on the concourse level that closes at 3pm on Saturdays and Sundays. So, there is no way to print a document or make copies after 3pm on the weekend. That was a significant problem for me and definitely not what I expect in a major hotel. There are lots of hotel choices in Chicago so if you are planning a work-related trip, you might want to consider some place other than the Swissotel.


Green Features: This hotel tries for Environmentally friendly. I really like the fact that they share the cost-savings of my forgoing daily towel and linen changes. Also, they include a recycle bin in the room along with a waste basket. All good!"
"Great location. A few blocks from the Mag Mile, Navy Pier and Millenium Park. I love the fact that all rooms here have a city view or lake view. There are many dining options, most are breakfast items. There's a convenience store right around the corner. They also have a mini-Mart inside of the hotel where you can purchase travel sized essential toiletries (a little overpriced, but you can consider it convenience tax). The beds are extremely comfortable."
"Stayed a long weekend and we found the Swissotel to be comfortable, conveniently located to downtown and in our room, QUIET.It was mostly a shopping weekend for the wife so we were able to walk from the hotel to Michigan Ave. NegativesA couple bottles of water would have been good in the room, but you have to pay 8$per bottle in room.I did not like the glass top on the desk as it was impossible to use your mouse when using your laptop. The TV remote was difficult to use. Had to press the buttons very hard to change a channel and placing a channel menu in the room would be nice so you know what's what on the TV without surfing.PositivesLoved the shower water, for some reason the water was not as hard as in most hotels, wasn't soft but not nearly as hard.Room had great blinds and was QUIET, huge plus.Fridge in room that I did not see on the web site but glad it was there.Bed was super comfortable.Overall, very nice and we'll be back

Green Features: They offered a 10 coupon for those that chose to not have their rooms cleans off food and beverage. Nice touch although we did not have the room cleaned we did not take advantage of the coupon."
"In the past, whenever we have arrived here by car, we were immediately greeted by one of several doorman. My wife's door was always opened for her and our baggage was removed from the trunk. Respect and politeness were always the orders of the day. Not anymore by a long shot. We recently pulled in, were kind of ordered to park "" over here"". No one opened my wife's car door and I lugged the baggage out of the trunk myself. Not a big deal for me but we both felt like the caring was definitely gone. The same thing happened when we left the next day. The bellman didn't really want to get our car delivered to the front but rather we should go to the basement and get it ourselves. When it arrived, they parked it away from the front door and no offer was made to open any doors, lift the luggage or even say anything...except to take our tip. I can take the rudeness but shame on you for not respecting my wife!We had checked in ""in advance"" on the computer, before we left, as an email from the hotel suggested we do to make check-in a breeze. We had made reservations six months in advance and requested one of several rooms we have had before. We were told this would not be a problem for Swiss Club members such as ourselves.Advance email check-in meant nothing we soon found out. We told them we'd be there at 1:00 pm and arrived at 1:10 pm. ""Sorry, not only are the rooms you requested not available and won't be, but no rooms would be available for 2-3 hours!! "" ""Just have a seat in the bar or go shopping and check back after 2 hours"" Oh yes, there would be a room or two available immediately, but not the kind we wanted. So we waited for two hours and finally a room became available. Turned out to be an excellent room and we were happy. We just wish they wouldn't offer fancy emails etc. to ""save you time"" and make promises they can't keep. We also wish they would bring back the previous check-in personnel who always made you feel very welcome and had a particular charm about themselves. This time we felt we were just checking into a hotel and they were neither happy nor upset that we were there. We were just plain old people....but they were quite willing to take your money!Check out result in a double billing for a $67 over night parking charge. They suggested we had brought two cars and parked both. Another feeling like we were just people they needed to move on. We worked out the credit but this kind of thing should never happen at this hotel.On the bright side, Troy, the bar tender was perfect. Fun to talk to, knew his wines and other drinks, and truly went out of his way to make you feel welcome. Way to go Troy! You could teach the front desk and bellmen how to treat people and how to welcome guests.Also, another plus is their excellent breakfast offering and the people who wait on you. Very nice and they too have always made us feel welcome. They even remembered us from our last visit.As a foot note, we suspect that our treatment was the result of driving our much older car in ( 2002 Toyota Avalon and not our new Avalon) and being dressed in just plain older clothes instead of or more dressy ones, just may have played a role in how we were treated. I hope not but it sure seems to fit.


Room Tip: Try to get a corner room that faces the river, the downtown and the Navy Pier.

Green Features: They are very good at this and encourage it by suggesting limited use of the water and towels."
"Everything about this beautiful hotel is top notch. The service is excellent all across the board. The comfortable room was elegant and quiet, with a superb view (you will need to request a room with a lake view). The room service food was delicious, and each time it arrived within 20 minutes of ordering. If you go, you must go for a swim (or soak) on the 42nd floor! We had no problems and had a wonderful time at Swissotel Chicago!"
"Had room 1501 and had a very nice view of the river and Navy Pier. Lovely hotel. Only downside is that it is a walk from Miracle Mile. It looks deceptively close but then at the end of a tiring all-day walking Chicago outing, it is still a good walk to the hotel. Do sign up for the Swiss Circle which is free and you'll get complimentary Wi-Fi and fitness facility access. Mini size empty refrigerator in room and bathrobes!"
"We stayed at the Swissotel in Chicago to attend the grand opening of Maggie Daley Park. We walked everywhere: to the park, to Eggy's for breakfast, to all points downtown, to Mariano's grocery store...The hotel lobby is lovely, the rooms are elegant and comfortable. We were on the 12th floor with a view of the river. We dined at the Palms in the lobby since we couldn't get a reservation anywhere else. It was a very mild Saturday night and EVERYONE was out and about. The service was phenomenal (thanks, Ruben!) and the steakhouse fare quite nice. Note: I had a cappuccino at the lobby bar that was honestly the best cappuccino I've ever had. My only complaint? No free Internet.


Room Tip: Ask for a view of the Chicago River.

"Arrived at Swissotel Chicago for a Holiday play and shopping on the Mag Mile. Location was perfect for both the shopping district and theater district. The hotel itself was spectacular and we secured a fine deal for the 2 rooms which are very modern and well appointed. Check in/out was very efficient and courteous. We enjoyed our stay at the Swissotel Chicago.


Room Tip: upper floor views are spectacular

"The Swiss Hotel is located close enough to Mag Mile but away from the congestion of traffic and thus is a great stay for business or pleasure. The rooms are modern and above average in size. Have all the typical amenities expected in a full service hotel. Note the parking cost and the extra cost for WiFi in the room. The hotel food is comparable to the other hotels in the category ie Westin.There is a good steak restaurant (Palm Restaurant) adjoining the lobby, I think the Swiss Hotel has a great staff, especially the front desk. Always had a great experience whenever I am in Chicago."
"Our stay at this hotel was unique in a few ways. One, the elevators do not have numbers on the inside of the car - you have to ask for an elevator by floor and it will assign one to you. This is difficult if you get the number wrong or change your mind about which floor you want to go to. Second, they have a green option that gives you a $10 per day credit for food if you forgo housekeeping. However, you need to ask for this at checkin or hang the correct sign on your door the first day - the do not disturb sign will not get you this credit. Next, there is a charge for internet but you can get free internet by signing up for a special plan which is free at checkin. I'm not sure what the purpose of this is since I'm sure everyone does it but oh well. We had a corner room with guaranteed view. I suggest you ask for the North corner as we had the SW corner and the view was limited - you had to stand at the window to see the river or lake. Otherwise it was nice and clean. I did a spa treatment which was lovely ansd I recommend it. The best part of our stay was dining at the Palm - fabulous! And they do a great job getting you a taxi out front. While this is not a 5star hotel it is nice and I would stay here again with the above mentioned things in mind.

"LOVED the Swissotel in Chicago. The place was beautiful and the staff incredibly kind and accommodating. The hotel is in the center of everything so this is the location you want. We used valet parking at the front door of the hotel but booked it on-line prior to our visit and a much discounted price. I also got a heck of a deal booking the hotel on-line.The interior is sleek but warm and welcoming. The bed was AWESOME, beautiful room with beautiful view and huge bathroom. The fitness room, pool and hot tub had long hours at no extra charge - very nice.I'd stay there again and again!


Green Features: request towel only service and they give you a $5 per day credit to use in hotel dining/."
"I stayed 3 nights in Nov. The place is pricey but you get fantastic service. Housekeeping in particular was superb. The room was immaculate and toiletries were replenished daily. The hotel also takes security seriously, which I appreciated. I came back while the lady was cleaning the room and she even asked me to scan my key card. The attention to detail and training was apparent in everyone that I interacted with at the hotel and I'd certainly stay again."
"Beautiful Place to stay, the hospitality is amazing... My Panoramic View from my suite so pretty especially at night, high standards of luxury, the staff amazing very friendly. Very pretty Hotel... The food service was on point.. I didn't want to go home! Everyone had a wonderful time... Love the atmosphere... great location to Shopping, Dining, and the famous Magnificent Mile.... My 2nd home I Love Chicago especially this time of the year it is so pretty just sooooooooooooo freezing Cold!

Wonderfully comfortable room and bed. Quiet. High-quality decor throughout. Only problem was navigating to the hotel from the nearest EL station. Hopefully the hotel will make more of an effort to provide resources such as a downloadable turn-by-turn directions sheet on their website for those guests who arrive on the Elevated Train and walk to the hotel. It's very easy to get lost in this area due to roads splitting onto multiple levels without the traveler realizing.
"We stayed in the Executive Corner Suite on the 38th floor. It was a luxurious and spacious room. We joked that for our party of four, there was one TV for each of us, including one very well-placed one in the bathroom mirror. There is a bar running along one side of the room facing the window. The views were spectacular! We had panoramic views of the beautiful Chicago skyline all around us. We were a LITTLE unnerved by how close we were to the office building next to us, as I'm pretty sure I could have read the emails on some of their computer screens. But that problem was easily solved by the drapes. Beds were absolutely one of the best I've experienced--thick duvet, solid mattress, and a variety of from which to choose. Bathroom was adequate. I would have preferred more high-ended toiletries. Housekeeping did an excellent job keeping our room clean, which I admit was a challenging task, since two of our party were camped out in the living room on a roll-away bed and the sofa bed. We also had a chance to check out the gym, pool, and spa. I definitely loved getting my workout while floating above the city from the 40th floor. But overall, fitness facilities were just okay for the amount of hype surrounding them. Spa was definitely not in line with my expectations. They were understaffed, and the facilities were rather uninspiring. Also, they struggled to charge my credit card and did not accept American Express. Location of the hotel is great. We were close to the Chicago Bean, the Magnificent Mile, and the starting location of the Architecture Tour. Also, delicious food options are everywhere. I fell in love with the city during my stay here, and would definitely come again, both to Chicago and Swissotel.

"Great location just off Michigan Ave. Easy access to all restaurants.Service is great, staff very helpful in making reservations for you, or what to see when in Chicago. Cab service if needed is right out front from the lobby. Breakfast in the Geneva restaurant downstairs is a bit expensive $29 for the buffet, but you can order off the menu. You can get a coffee and sweet roll in the lobby bar."
"My partner and I decided to go check out Chicago for a long weekend back in Chicago. The front desk attendant was super. She saw that my partner was French and began to speak to him fluently. Come to find out she grew up less than an hour from where he lives. We got a higher floor room facing Lake Michigan with views of the Chicago River. Awesome view! The room was comfortable and spacious with a nice bed and roomy bathroom. Our only issue, although it's kind of funny looking back at it now is that when we got our room key pass and went into our room, there was an interesting skunk-y smell (I'll leave you to guess what this was) when we opened the door and as we walked in, I saw that the room was already occupied. We shouted ""We're sorry"" just in case someone was in there and ran out and shut the door. I guess this might have ruined the experience for some but it really did't bother us. The front staff was very apologetic although it would have been nice to get an upgrade for our embarrassment :-P

"I was in Chicago for the Taste of Chicago weekend, was my first time in Chicago and no previous experience with the brand but I have to say... I was pleasantly surprised as I had no idea what to expect. The hotel was reasonably priced, rooms were well adorned to expectation, the views were just amazing as we were on a high floor, of the city and the water. It was very conveniently located as you could walk or short taxi cab to quite a few attractions. Tried some appetizers/drinks at the bar downstairs and that was decent. They were very accommodating and allowed us an early check-in as our flight got there pretty early. I would definitely stay there again!


Room Tip: Higher floors, as you get amazing Chicago views...

"I had the misfortune of spending a few nights here. Seriously, take your money elsewhere to a hotel that understands customer service.Bad attitudes from the wait staff all the way through to the manager. This hotel will attempt to extract money from you in any way it can. Beware of hidden fees and charges, and limitations with the buffet. One coffee limit on the $32 breakfast buffet - really???I've stayed at a lot of hotels and the surly attitude from this one takes the cake.To the hotel owner: sack your manager and implement a customer service training program for all staff, emphasising the importance of keeping customers happy and it's effect on profitability.Attempting to extort cash from fees, levied to your customers at every possible opportunity is not a sustainable way to increase the bottom line!"
"Staff was great. Beds were very comfrtable. I few minor cleanliness issues but overall very nice. Biggest complaint was I felt paying $299 night, $65 valet (only option other thatn $37night in a parking garage which was fortunately just accross the street), and $25 internet fee/day was excessive. If I'm paying $299 night, internet should be included and valet parking should be more reasonable. It was difficult to find. Traffic very challenging. However, it was walking distance to Lakeshore Dr, shopping, etc."
"I was staying at Swissotel for a work conference and all the meetings and presentations were onsite, so, I was in the hotel for the better part of 2 days. I can say that all of the staff from front desk, housekeeping to banquet and bar staff were all very polite, knowledgeable and helpful. The rooms were fairly large and comfortable with all the options one needs during a stay. The views, depending on room, can be wonderful to alright if your looking at the hotel next door etc...but, the cleaning staff did a great job each day and night. The lobby is kinda small and crowded and with the bar right when you walk in and the Palms restaurant all right there it can get kinda close when large groups are checking in. The location is great, you have a few blocks walk to Mich Ave and the shopping, restaurants and Millenium Park is a few blocks away...plus the river is right across the street. I would recommend this hotel to anyone who wants an upscale hotel in Chicago with a good central location to explore from."
I booked this hotel for my client that comes to Chicago on a regular basis for business. Upon his arrival at the hotel i received the call that the reservation was cancelled the morning of the arrival and it was cancelled by ...ME...(which never happened).I asked the receptionist to look for another reservation and was told that there was none.After couple of requests and wasted time and the person was able to find the reservation and without any apologies - hung up the phone!!!!!!!!!! Are you serious??? I am also in the hospitality business and would never ever treat anyone like that.In any way i will never book this hotel for any of my clients. Service is the most important part of the hospitality business even if the hotel lacks everything else.G.B
"First time staying at a Swissotel. Visiting Chicago for medical convention. Outstanding property. Only problem was noise from loud voices that I believe were being conducted along the metal wall construction elements. After I notified the front desk. I was initially told that there was no noise outside the room when they checked, but when I called a second time, I think they figured it out and the problem stopped. I will definitely stay here again when the meeting returns to Chicago."
"If you're having a family event or romantic occasion, I would not recommend this hotel. I believe this hotel is best suited for business travelers attending conferences because hospitality and customer service is a secondary priority at this property. None of the employees seemed particularly happy or welcoming, which makes me wonder how they are trained and/or treated themselves. There...

"This is a very friendly, pleasant place to stay. The staff is great, and the rooms are pleasant, with a nice desk/work space. For what you get, the price is very reasonable. I liked it but had a few reservations that you might want to consider: (1) It's in the theater district, which could be a positive, though there do not seem to be any very good restaurants nearby. (2) The bathrooms are very small with little shelf space. (3) The heater was pretty noisy and woke me up when it started and stopped; otherwise, the room was very quiet."
"This is a nice hotel. It's in the heart of the Theatre District and just about a half mile from Millennium Park. I recommend staying here if you can find a good deal...but it's the least nice of the Kimpton brand that I've stayed at. I think it may be because it is an old hotel that has been renovated, but it doesn't feel as luxurious as the other Kimpton's I've been to. Also, the bathrooms and rooms are pretty small. If I could give it a 3 1/2 star rating I would because it's definitely a step above most other hotels. I don't think you can go wrong staying here, but I don't think it quite lives up to its brand name."
"I stayed at this very trendy and upscale Hotel Allegro right in the heart of Chicago's Theatre District. Check was an ease and quick. My room was 1428 which was a queen room. The room was clean and comfy. The bathroom was rather small but didn't bother me since I was by myself in Chicago. The bed was very comfortable. This hotel is next to the Cadillac Theatre and just down the street is the Ford Oriental Theatre, The Goodman Theatre, Chicago Theatre and a close walk to the Lyric Opera House on Wacker Drive. I highly recommend the fabulous Kimpton Hotel Allegro on Randolph Street in Chicago as you won't be disappointed.

"I paid $409 (plus taxes and fees) for this room, so I was expecting to be wowed when I opened the door. Instead, my reaction was, ""I'm paying $409 for THIS?"" Make no mistake - the room was clean and comfortable and the bed and air system were very good.But the room was small and the bathroom was really small - one could shave, pee, and shower at the same time. They provided only one bar of soap - not separate facial and bath bars like every other hotel on the planet. It had a vessel-type sink, with a faucet so low one had to tilt a drinking glass to fill it with water.The business desk was ample and included two desktop outlets and had an adjustable office chair.The hotel lobby was small, cramped, segmented and old (not in the good way), with a low ceiling. The complimentary evening reception was so cramped and uncomfortable-looking, I took one look and went back up to my room.This hotel gets the fat room rate because a major state government building is across the street and City Hall is just around the corner. Overall, your everyday Holiday Inn Express is a better experience than the Allegro (and, of course, about a quarter of the price)."
"I had a good experience at a Kimpton in Cambridge so I decided to stay at one on my trip to Chicago. It was a big mistake. I had a king size single room for 4 nights. The room was very small and the bathroom was tiny. The carpets are worn out and the styling is dated. Also, I can hear everything the woman in the room next to me says so I could barely sleep one night. When I called the desk they sent up ear plugs...The service was poor as well. I called to get room service, but it isn't offered at this hotel so they gave me the number of a local Chinese restaurant. I like Chinese, but seriously. What hotel in this price range doesn't have room service? I sent some laundry to be done and paid for 5 hour express service. It wasn't delivered after 6 hours so I called the desk. They said it was supposed to be delivered at 6pm, which was 8 hours after I gave it to them. 7:30 rolls around and it still isn't delivered so I call again. I finally get it. 9.5 hours after I sent it down.Avoid this place and stay at Lowes or Virgin."
"Having stayed in Kimptons Hotels on four previous visits to USA we found this hotel not up to standards. We were staying for our 30th wedding anniversary so thought the Kimpton chain would be a good choice. The room was very small not clean and seemed very tired although I was told it was a room that had been renovated. Check in staff not very efficient and also charged again for my room on check out even though room was pre-paid. It is ideally situated in Chicago which is a wonderful city to visit. I was assured when I found out that the hotel was undergoing work that this would not interfere with stay,that was not the case. Much better hotels in same area of Chicago."
We loved our stay at this hotel - we did have a suite so it was crazy spacious and the decor was unreal! We loved chilling in the lobby and taking pictures in different areas of the hotel that were so quirky and different. The area at night is kind-of dead as it's in the West Loop so no nightlife like other neighborhoods in Chicago but it's so close to all the action that it didn't matter all that much. Overall we enjoyed our stay and we'd definitely go back!
"Room was small, but good view and very ice and clean. Bed was extremely comfortable. Wifi is free. Parking cost is okay. I had a difficult time trying to pull up in front of the hotel at checkin time as there was a ton of traffic and the main entrance was under construction, so I started to panic maybe the place wasn't open. But it is.

"This is a nasty hotel. When I booked here, no one mentioned it was undergoing extensive renovations. I arrived late on a Wednesday night. The front desk staff told me there was no food available at the hotel, and if I hurried, I might make it to a bar 3 blocks away that was serving food for another 20 minutes. The carpeting in the hallway was dirty, and there were amateurishly painted black walls. Dim lighting in the room didn't hide the dirty carpeting or dusty furniture. At first glance, I was scared to put anything the floor, so kept my luggage on the desk. I was right, I got 3 bites on my feet/ankles from something in the room.There were two tiny closets, neither was very clean. One held a yoga mat. Maybe they could lose the mat, and clean the carpet.The air in the room felt heavy. Imagine my surprise to see the thick pane of Plexiglas that prevented the window from being opened. I had to turn on the air conditioner for air.There were two positives. The tiny bathroom was clean. The bed was clean and comfortable. Unfortunately, the oppressive environment prevented a good night's sleep.I was in town for an event. This hotel was recommended by the event staff. When I told them how awful it was, they said they'd had other complaints and were considering removing it from their recommended list. I suggest you avoid this hotel. After my unfortunate experiences in the public areas, I wonder what nasty surprises are lurking in the non-public areas. Ick.

"I stayed here while the hotel was undergoing renovations, and agree with the prior reviewer that the disruption associated with the renovations is truly minimal.Desk staff was, as always, spot-on with service, friendly, efficient. Amenities are the usual nice Kimpton, both in terms of bathroom amenities in your room and coffee in the am/ wine in the PM. The rooms aren't huge but they are comfortable (I had an upgraded corner room with a lovely sitting area). The rooms have been renovated and they are fabulous!


Green Features: Kimptons are excellent at minding the environment, and it is one reason why they are a go-to for me."
"I have stayed at this property before and have stayed in Kimptons around the country maintaining their ""Inner Circle"" status for a couple of years. When I mentioned to friends and colleagues how much this place has gone downhill, it seems to be common knowledge in the area. The price is high, even in a big city for the level of service and amenities. They are renovating but the rooms are very small with only an uncomfortable desk chair to sit in. There is no room service, but you can take out from the restaurant if you can find their menu on the website because it's not provided anywhere else. When I called to place an order and asked for a simple sandwich from the lunch menu I was told it wasn't available for dinner because they were only a ""fine dining"" establishment. Why they couldn't accommodate the order or don't have a better sense of what business travelers might want is unacceptable. The restaurant is a full blown Italian; the menu looks great but not what I want after 5 hours on a plane. There was loud hammering and Wilkie talkie noises for 30 minutes at 1 am one night. Clearly some maintenance issue and why this would occur in the middle of the night is absurd. Front desk staff seems uninterested in feedback or complaints. When I asked to speak to the manager at 8 am one morning I was told he was unavailable and wouldn't be available when I returned from work later since he left for the day at 4pm. They were referring to the front office manager and I guess I should have pushed for another manager interested in guests' experience and feedback. It's sad to watch this place decline. If I have a choice from my corporate travel dept. I'll definitely go elsewhere."
"situated in amongst the shops bars and restaurants, easy access to main areas of interest. Staff were very accommodating nothing was ever too much trouble. Hotel was undergoing refurb but this did not effect our stay. Make sure you ask for a coffee maker In your room or else you have to pop downstairs in the lobby to get a cuppa. Wine hour is a must ,lovely way to start your evening.Get the red line train from the airport and get off at Clarke and Lake costs 3 dollars each and is quicker than a taxi."
"Though the hotel was under renovations while I was there the disruptions were minimal. Very small rooms but I was there on business so not really an issue. Very very nice staff. Could not be more helpful. Good restaurant. Only downside is that you must walk outside of the hotel and around the corner to access. Not so nice in rainy and cold April that Chicago is. I would recommend it overall as a well located business hotel..


Room Tip: Ask to be away from the elevators. It got very noisy one night when I was trying to get to sleep

"The walls are thin, expect to hear your neighbours, their arguments or the ""good mornings"" when they meet up.The bathrooms are closet sized and the bed is probably the worse Kimpton bed I've slept in but maybe it was just that it was a pillow top.The hotel was undergoing renovation but really didn't disrupt the stay. The adjoining restaurant was poor and I hope the food is next on the renovation list.Fitness centre had relatively big, varied (free weights, gym balls, machines) but no windows and opposite guest rooms.Amenities were CO Bigelow for Kimpton: relatively bland but well proportioned.Wi-fi dropped out now and again. The elevators were paradoxical in that they seemed so quick when you were inside them but you are left waiting for quite a while, particularly in the lobby area."
"First of all, our stay was amazing. Hands down our favorite Hotel in Chicago....as a Kimpton Karma Rewards member we get special rates, opportunities for upgrades and a $10 raid the mini bar coupon. Everyone gets a free 5-6 pm wine and beer reception every evening. When the concierge asked where we were going to dinner he called ahead as we were walking through the lobby and had the restaurant give us a complementary appetizer.The room we stayed in was smaller than before but it was still very comfortable....love the easy wifi, minibar, robes, yoga mat and 24 hr yoga channel. It had been redecorated. I think in the larger rooms the scale of the design in the carpet and wallpaper probably work better. Kind of a nod to Art Deco....The new bathrooms are really nice however. We did have one small maintenance problem with the toilet but they were there in five minutes....called us because we had left the ""do not disturb"" outside the door before knocking (I love that) and then were in and out in five minutes....crisis averted! Every single person on staff, whether it is the front desk, wine reception, bellman (who remembered us from a previous visit), concierge, doorman, maintenance, or valet is so friendly, polite, and accommodating...they treat us like we are millionaires (trust me we aren't). We love staying in the theater district whether we are seeing a production or not. Virtually on-site is Chicago 312, and excellent restaurant and small bar, and so many great restaurants within walking distance! If you don't want to walk, cabs are plentiful. We also love that this hotel is dog-friendly. Needless to say we have already booked our next stay."
"The hotel is under renovation but they do not do work until after 9:00 a.m. in the morning. I am not sure when they stop because I came at 7:00 p.m. and it was quite. Small rooms but very pleasant. Hotel staff are just the best. I had a 'ton' of luggage after a many week travel experience in many cities. I stayed with my daughter, who also have too much luggage. They had no problem with all our junk. The manager on duty could see my problem immediately and came to give me help. She was very professional and brought over a specific employee to give me a hand. Even though there is construction, it does not seem to be a problem. No problem with in internet and I am a high user of it at the hotel.


Room Tip: My understanding the fourth floor was the first floor to be renovated.

The allegro was undergoing maintenance but that in no way hampered my stay. The thing that I did appreciate the most about this hotel is that they actually have a light switch that turns on the light for the whole room.I'm really sick of hotels that just have a little tiny light above the bed and nothing on the ceiling.They rearranged my toiletries more than most hotels and even placed a couple of my things on a shelf across the bathroom that almost caused me to leave them behind.I sprayed myself in the face a few times with the shower because even after all of these years the faucet with the stick handle that you turn a little bit for the top and a lot of bit for the hand shower always result in getting sprayed out of the hand held shower sprayer.A good visit. Awesome location. Will stay again.
"Very Pleasant staff upon arrival. Found parking around the corner for $42 a night. The hotel itself is undergoing renovations, and I'm not quite sure if I had a renovated room or original room. The room itself was average to small in size. The bathrooom, while nicely appointed, was very small. The location is excellent if you plan to go to a theater show or view the Willis Tower. The 312 restaurant served a quick and delicious Eggs Benedict on Sunday morning."
"Staff is welcoming and amazing - really responsive and focused. Great job management. Hotel is under construction - limited in hotel choices for breakfast/dinner etc while construction is going on. Stayed in older rooms (not renovated). It is okay - small, desk faces wall - so cannot easily work and watch TV.Coffee in the morning was lukewarm - and wine in the evening was a nice touch. Overall the lobby is somewhat dim and the construction makes the whole thing less then it could be.Walgrens is right across the corner - and of course there are restaurants to go nearby."
"This hotel is basically within walking distance to everything you need to see, millenium park and the shops of michigan ave. They are doing a remodel its beautiful so far and no, there was no noise. Our view was of concrete buidlings, but that cant be helped in a large city like chicago. The staff was very friendly, the room was small but very clean and if you forget shampoo they use co bigelow products, which are amazing."
"The bride booked a block of rooms here for her out of town guests. What a great hotel! Super easy ( and cheap! ) to get to from O' Hare using the blue line to Lake and Clark street station. It was 5 dollars and about 50 minutes. Easy peasy. The hotel is under renovation construction, but we only knew that from reading prior reviews and the first day we arrived ( friday) we could smell fresh paint in the hallway. Otherwise, we were not affected at all by construction. Some of the people from the wedding party who also stayed here complained about the room size, but we felt like the room was fine. It was clean, the bed comfortable, and fit our luggage with no issue. We were only there to sleep! Free happy hour! Hello! Beer and wine, every night for an hour. Great fun and a good way to meet other guests. We enjoyed that every night of our stay! The coffee is not the best, but complimentary. So there is that. Skip it and walk 4 blocks to Intelligentsia coffee shop. The staff was pleasant, professional and accommodating. Jean- luc, in addition to pouring a generous glass of wine and beer gave us an awesome dinner recommendation ( Sunda rocked, thank you! ). Kudos Jean-luc, kudos.the hotel was conveniently located near major theatres, good restaurants and millennium park. Good quality hotel for the money. I will stay here again when we return!"
Very disappointed! We knew hotel was under construction but from other reviews it seemed to be fine. Not for us! Our room was old and just felt so dirty!!! I didn't want to take my socks off and slept with light on. Yuck! Hairs in shower hairs on bed spread! Also we got to hotel around10pm no where to eat or have a drink! Very expensive and very disappointed!we will never stay there again! We stayed at Omni Chicago hotel the night before and loved it!!!
"Spend a Saturday night here to see a show & have dinner during the hotel's construction phase. The staff is very friendly and helpful. The room decor and amenities were nice for an older hotel. Excellent location in walking distance to theatre district and transportation. Also had a lovely pre-theatre dinner at their Italian restaurant, 312 Chicago. We'll be back again to stay another time after their lobby renovation. Recommended."
"The hotel was under construction during my stay. There was no construction noise at night, and the only issue I had was minor - only one elevator was in service for a period of time during my stay. I think they did a very good job of limiting construction inconvenience . My room was small, but very well appointed and quiet. I could hear very little street noise and did not hear people in the adjoining rooms. This hotel is located within a block of the Washington and Wells train station and two blocks from North Wacker. It is convenient to west loop businesses. I recommend this hotel for business travelers, but my room would have been very small for a family.


Room Tip: Ask for a room on an upper floor for less street noise.

"Spent one night at Hotel Allegro in March 2015 for a random weekend in the city with my husband. Classic hotels in Chicago have great atmosphere, and when the Allegro finishes their construction, it should make a nice alternative to similar-style places. Until then, the hotel is more utilitarian. We did have a lovely stay, however. We were fortunate enough to be able to check in at 10 a.m. and were given a newly renovated room on the 19th floor. Fresh robes were in the closet, and fluffy socks were available for purchase. There was also a well-stocked mini bar/fridge. I will note that the bathroom was extremely small, even moreso than is usual with a historic Chicago hotel. It was also lacking a full-length mirror, an oversight I hope they remedy. The staff was extremely pleasant and helpful; one staff member actually walked us over to where the ATM was stationed, rather than just pointing the way. The cocktail hour is a nice touch, although I don't think it is enough to replace a full-service lobby bar. The hotel is clearly in a state of transition, so I will be interested in seeing what becomes of it in the future. One thing to consider when booking here: Location. The Allegro is very conveniently located to theaters and the financial district. However, the hotel is just far enough away from the Mag Mile, lakefront, and better restaurants to make walking a chore. The area tends to shut down by 10 pm, so late-night activity and dining is very hard to come by in that area."
"Booked online, it was noted they are currently under construction. Stayed over Valentine's weekend. Temporary lobby, nothing fancy, but functional. Service was excellent throughout whole stay. Booked room and valet package, highly recommend, because parking can be expensive. Good value for your money. Had sparkling wine and chocolates delivered to room, great touch!!! Loved the lobby drink service in the...

"Super convenient inside Loop hotel with consistently friendly staff. Have stayed over a dozen times in a variety of rooms. Feeling the need for more breathing room? The rooms with 2 queen beds usually have plenty of space. The king rooms have everything you need, too! 312 has a fabulous prix fixe menu and fantastic servers. And no need to put your coat on in the winter to enter the restaurant. Business center is easy to access and front desk team bends over backwards to make your life on the road easier. Kimpton Karma Rewards ensure free wifi and earn points for free stays. Hoping these stay separate as Kimpton merges with IHG, but we shall see!"
"This was my first visit to the Hotel Allegro and I know it will not be my last. I've stayed in Chicago frequently over the past few years and this was my favorite stay. We chose this hotel for its central location in the loop but just far enough away from the Magnificent Mile to feel like a local.I love Kimpton for the fact they make every guest feel like a VIP and this stay was no different. I was travelling with my brother and sister in law on their first trip to Chicago and I worked with Guest Experience Supervisor Adam O. in advance to set up a welcome amenity for their room. Not only did he set up the perfect gift for them but he went above and beyond to create a personalized welcome for my room as well! It set the tone for an unforgettable first impression of this great hotel.Other reviewers have mentioned the small rooms but I found the room to be perfectly cozy and nicely appointed. It's great for a weekend getaway especially if you aren't planning on spending much time in the room and when you are in a great city like Chicago why should you? The room was especially clean and the bathroom was spotless. Our room was on the 9th floor facing Randolph and we experienced none of the noise that other reviewers had also mentioned.I loved the historical touches of the building like the crown molding and high ceilings in the rooms and the beautiful grand lobby. Lots of great little nooks and crannies to explore and I especially loved the little nook above the grand staircase. Great place to relax and watch the comings and goings.Little touches like the free wine hour and morning coffee and hot chocolate bar were nice perks. And the added bonus of being a member of their loyalty program gets you free wifi and a credit for the bar/minibar.When it comes to hotels, Kimpton knows what they are doing and I look forward to staying with them many more times in the future, in Chicago and elsewhere.

"The lobby of this hotel is beautiful! The social hour they do each night at 5:00 is wonderful; just a nice opportunity to sit and enjoy a glass of complimenary wine. We do with they would have had a beer for my husband though. Our first night was a bit rocky in the original room we were put in. The walls could be a tad thicker... two noisy children next door had us up hours before our alarm. I called down the next morning after my husband had left for his meetings and explained our situation to James, the manager. He was so understanding and accommodating! He moved us to a two room corner suite with a great view and very quiet.The restaurant is amazing food! We ate both a breakfast and a noon lunch there, give it a whirl!Would stay again for sure :)


Room Tip: Don't get a room that was or is adjoining... no privacy. Average rooms are very small.

"Having driven Route 66 this was our final stop off. However of all the hotels we visited during our stay this was by far the worst room. It was very clean and pleasant, however it was incredibly small and shabby in parts, after the beautifully grand entrance and reception areas it was a real disappointment. The service we received here and the restaurant could not be faulted at all, we just expected much more from the room. Its a great location within very easy reach of all the sites.

"Friends and I stayed at the Allegro Hotel this past weekend - I have stayed at the Allegro previously on business and once again, this Hotel did not disappoint. What sets it apart from all the other downtown Chi-town hotels you ask?1. Central location. Not smack dab in the middle of the Magnificent Mile and the obscene numbers of tourists but very close to Macy's (Xmas windows - location), Theatre District, the waterfront, and the Loop to get around the City to name a few.2. The staff. Without question, hospitality is not forced and Adam Osborne and the other members of the Allegro Kimpton family were so welcoming and ready to offer some great suggestions for our stay;3. Kimpton Chain. Like other aspects of this Hotel and unlike other global brands, the Kimpton Hotel brand really tries to make you feel welcome, offering happy hours, and other amenities while away from home.The rooms were not large and the bathroom was quite tiny - the only drawbacks. Easily overcome as the amount of time spent in our rooms was truly minimal. Besides, if you've spent time in NYC and Europe, this is no surprise.So, if you're off to Chicago, try the Allegro. Beautiful old history combined with wonderful modern amenities with a dash of fantastic hospitality and comfort."
"I stayed here on business. It is a fine spot to hang your hat, but isn't really someplace I can recommend boldly. The rooms are very, very small and the walls are thin. You can hear conversations and televisions on the rooms on either side as well as street noise through the windows. On the plus side, there's free wifi for Kimpton Karma members and the free wine hour was very spirited when I was there. I'd never seen them attract so many guests who were so eager to migle and share tips on what to see and do in Chicago. The hotel is in a great location and the front desk was very helpful to me."
"Took a shot at trying this hotel, and made an excellent choice. This hotel was just 3 blocks from the Kriskingle Village on the Daily Plaza in Chicago. Also Macy's and several other stores, theaters are all in walking distance. The L train platform is just 1 block away. The hotel has great service, and very friendly. Erin helped us a lot, she answered all of our questions. Would definitely stay here again. A very charming hotel."
"Booked the hotel for just over $100/night. Small quaint C L E A N room, unfortunately came with a queen bed. The location was very convenient! I never heard the metro which is literally next to the hotel. Bill @ the front desk was amazing! He checked me in and checked me out and made everything very easy! Valet parking was easy (worth the $50 to just pull up and get out of my car and not worry about it til I called for it again). Definitely would stay again for a king size bed and the price!! ;-) and the 5-6 beer/wine hour is worth it!!!


Room Tip: Ask for a king size bed.

"I got lucky on some booking site & paid a little over $100 a night -usually it's double or so. Anyway, it was a good experience: The location is good (close to the El, walking distance to Michigan, rental bikes across the street (the hotel rents them too), good restaurants, etc.); The hotel lobby is inviting -especially during the free wine social hour every weeknight! It makes meeting people easy. Decent coffee & infused water are always available. The staff was helpful & friendly. The room was clean & accommodating -it even had guest robes.Overall it was a great stay. I would stay there again.


Green Features: They are eco-friendly and state so in their literature."
"I've now stayed at this hotel twice for business trips - and woudl stay again, but really don't get whe people are so enamored with it. The service is fine but nothign special. The lobby is very well decorated, kind of cool. The rooms and bathrooms are TINY (especially the bathroom). A colleague rold me to be sure and close the toilet lid - couldn't figure out what she meant until I realized, the space is so small if you drop somethign in the bathroom it will end up in the toilet! The sink is ""funky"" but so oddly shaped that you can hardly wash your hands in it. The shower is normal size but has one of those flowing inside curtains that ends up sticking to you in the shower - yuck ;-) I will say the rooms and bathrooms seemed very clean and the beds are comfy.


Green Features: They have recycling bins in the rooms which is nice"
"Fab hotel five minute walk from Macys and the blue line tube stops just across the road.Room size good can see why people say bathroom is a bit small but it's adequate for the purpose it's intended for. To be honest we never spend much time in our room there to see Chicago!Yes nice touch free coffee & tea in the lobby mornings. Free wine & beer happy hour no limit!Spacious lobby and nice restaurant. We had a continental breakfast in our package.Fresh juice. Bowl of fruit. Toast, croissant, Danish or muffin. Tea or coffee.Couldn't fault it. Happily stay there again!!"
"Stayed here a Monday thru Wednesday with my mom. Loved its proximity to the Christkindlmarket, which was the primary reason we stayed here. Also, other hotels in walking distance and with better/cheaper rates were booked 60 days prior so we had little choice.We stayed in room 925 & it was pleasant, nice size, clean. You could hear the train rumble by frequently but it was not bothersome & did not disturb our sleep. The one complaint we had (& we shared it at checkout) was that the TV often lost its signal. ABC channel never came thru during our stay & others would cut in & out mid-programming. Very frustrating, especially when paying $300+ a night & trying to relax after walking around the city all day.Loved their nightly happy hour in the lobby. Service was attentive when needed throughout our stay. 312 Chicago & Starbucks are connected to the hotel - very convenient, especially during the winter.Would not stay here with kids as no pool & very expensive for a family stay. Other guests we spoke with at happy hour shared that the hotel chain is very pet friendly.Would stay here for future business travel but will find less expensive hotels with more amenities for future personal travel."
"We got a great deal on Priceline to stay at Allegro. Normally we always stay in big name hotels in Chicago, but this was such a good idea to try something new and fresh!The staff was very welcoming - something that not always happens everywhere anymore. The rooms were very clean and equipped with everyone one could need. The lobby was very great, offering coffee and tea in the morning and also a happy hour around six. Oh yes, and the location is just perfect! Absolutely loved everything! Definitely recommend! p.s. Allegro is dog-friendly :)"
"I had read some reviews about this hotel, saying among other things, that the elevators are slow. First off, I never had an issue with the elevators. Perhaps that's because I was out very early and back at sundown.The room I stayed in was on the smaller side, but not tiny. I have been to much smaller ones. The room was clean, quiet, the water was hot. The room air conditioning/heat was adjustable and satisfactory for my stay. I mainly used the heat.There was a desk in the room, and free Wifi if you join the Kimpton rewards program (free to sign up to). The carpet and bath seemed to be relatively new and modern. There was a very small closet for your use, and a snack cabinet. I had a room on the 15th floor, and the view was of the street in front of the hotel. The TV was High Definition, and I think it was about 40 inches, with a limited channel selection typical of hotels.The front desk people were always courteous and pleasant, and seemed eager to please. There was an afternoon wine tasting.I did not use the restaurant or other facilities in the hotel, since I had all meals covered by the meeting I attended.The location in the Theater district was great for me. There are plenty of places to used the public transportation nearby. Considering the cost, using Priceline, compared to larger name brands I could have used, I was pleased.


Room Tip: If you think you'll be going in or out at peak hours, then perhaps get a lower floor so you can...

Green Features: About the same as other large hotels I have stayed at. I used the same towels by hanging them up. They made the bed every day for me."
"My daughter and I went to Chicago for a mother-daughter weekend in October. I searched for a property that was convenient to our needs and affordable. I found that at the Allegro - and got a free wine/beer hour each night too! Wonderful amenity! Plus an additional $10 chit to have a cocktail at the bar at their restaurant 312 next door. Room wasn't big but comfortable! Convenient location to Michigan Avenue and easy access to the Metro at Wells/Washington stop from Midway airport. Also a couple of blocks over to State and Washington to take Bus 146 to the Museum campus area.Will look to stay here again in the future!SharronBelleville, IL


Green Features: Environmentally friendly - washes towels if left on floor but not if you want to reuse."
"Stayed here in October, and I must compliment pretty much every aspect of the stay.The room was fantastic, with comfortable beds and nice facilities. All the staff members I encountered were positive and friendly. As for location: well, it's slap bang in the centre of the city with excellent transit facilities for getting around (and lots to see and do within walking distance too).Free Wifi is easily obtained by joining Kimpton Karma, and worked well throughout the property.The Allegro is certainly a place I'd recommend for anyone visiting Chicago."
"The staff is very friendly! From the doorman to the front desk to the man that brought up our bags. We asked for a room in the back, so that we would not hear much street noise, and it was a quiet room. Other reviewers mention hearing the people in the next rooms, but we did not. The bed was very comfortable. The bathroom is extremely small! But all in all, the location is great, the staff is great, and we loved the wine in the afternoon, and the coffee in the morning (they also brought a Keurig coffeemaker to our room). We would stay here again.


Room Tip: room in the back, higher up to avoid the noise

"First, stay in the city and was very impressed with the location of the hotel. We had a nice quiet room as requested, maybe a little dark (poor natural lighting). The only problem was the wi-fi connection, great problems getting the connection and had to log onto hotel site several times. Main area of the hotel lovely. I found the staff lovely and the concierge most helpful in recommending places to visit and her choice of restaurants - excellent.


Room Tip: High floor. We asked for a room away from the lift area.

"We've stayed in numerous Kimpton properties and this was our least favourite. The desk staff were quite rude, not particularly accommodating, and not at all welcoming. However, our safe stopped working one evening and the man who came to fix it was lovely and gave us loads of tips for places to visit. The baggage hold staff were nice too. The wine hour was only ok. We were disappointed to see that the same wine and beer was served each of the 4 nights we were there, whereas it changed nightly in other Kimpton properties. A bit of variety would have been nice! We went to the bar attached to the property one night and enjoyed some of the cocktails, but it was closed the following night (a Saturday!) for a private party. We went for drinks to the restaurant linked to the hotel instead and it was dead at 10pm. By 10.05 we were the only people there and couldn't wait to get out as the staff were cleaning around us. The rooms were nice enough, although small. The bed was very comfortable and the bathroom was tiny but well equipped. The hotel is centrally located and it was easy to walk to places in the neighbouring area. It is in what appeared to be the business district though so it shuts down VERY early, and you'll have to walk at least 15 minutes on a weekend morning to find anywhere open for breakfast, apart from the restaurant attached to the hotel which was overpriced. Overall, the hotel was okay. Not as friendly, nicely designed or appointed as other Kimpton hotels we have stayed at (the Monaco Portland being the best)."
"Staff, interesting rooms and exceptional service made our stay at this Kimpton as great as our visits to their other properties. Their decor is always fun and their willingness to find whatever necessity you've forgotten is great. The Allegro has a great location - especially if you come in on the train from one of the airports. Theaters and restaurants are all around and many venues are an easy walk."
"The OutlierI stayed at the Kimpton, Chicago for two days on a business trip. I always enjoy staying at Kimpton properties for their unique yet boutique feel. The Kimpton experience is hard to define which I find appealing. For context, I consider this particular property as business boutique with a touch of luxury.The hotel is well-situated to shopping and Millennial park. The hotel lobby is located on the second level which had a rock n' roll esthetic. I checking in at noon, so the lobby was not busy and the check-in was quick, and the desk attendant was cordial without being pandering.The room size was average size (for a city hotel). However, I found the bathroom to be very small with the sink rotated 90-degrees from normal to fit on the small vanity.The bed linens were exceptional as were the bath towels. Bath amenities were from Begilow [sic]. A bathrobe was provided in a small yet adequate closet across from the bathroom. The desk was equipped with an abundance of outlets (which for an old-building retro-fit is a rarity).The decor was contemporary and in-keeping with the theme of the hotel. Little touches like the fuzzy-socks and yoga mat in the closet almost made me forget that I was in town on business. Indeed, when I turned on the TV the channel was playing a yoga instructional (and yes I took a few minutes in dow-dog).The room was spotless. I rarely comment on room cleanliness as this is often taken for granted. But the room was exceptionally clean. For example - the shower. There is usually some type of vent in the shower of hotels. In even the best of hotels, one can find that this vent is dusty. Not here though. Even the shower curtain showed no signs of mildew or even spots for that matter.There was not a coffee machine in the room, however you could request one through room service. Coffee service in the lobby was more than adequate.I would give this hotel 4.5 stars, only because of the small bathroom. Attention to details, uniqueness, and the overall experience make this property a stand-out."
"Location can't be beat. The el is right there. It is a short walk to Michigan Ave and Millenium Park. Theaters abound. This is a great spot down town and less pricey than along the Miracle Mile, even though it is right there.The hotel's decor is bold and interesting. I liked it. Somewhat art deco meets mid-century, but not really one strong theme. It was nice to be in a uniquely decorated place. Lobby is fun. Lot's of good restaurants close by, so no reason to feel stuck with the ones in the hotel.Everyone mentioned waiting on the elevators... we were there for the Chicago Marathon and the hotel was FULL, but the elevators were not that big of a deal. Yes, you stop at about 8 floors every time you ride, but it makes for incredibly humorous and entertaining social interactions and observations every time. Yes, you wait, but it's not awful. Five minutes max.And, if you can handle the five minute wait, the top floors have amazing views! We got a room that gave us views at the sky scrapers close to us (we were on the NW corner of the building, floor 16).The staff were super kind and accommodating. One of the gentlemen at the front desk hunted down some chamomile tea for me late one night and just gave it to me. They also kindly extended our check out time to 2pm the day of the marathon. Lastly, I really appreciated that they sent out travel tips and information via email a few days before our trip. Great value in Chicago where you're going to pay $$$ for a room no matter what.Room was quiet, and newly remodeled / decorated. It didn't seem particularly small. We hardly spent any time there anyway, so it wouldn't have mattered. Only one complaint: no fan in the bathroom for ventilation!Highly recommend this place to anybody heading to Chicago.


Room Tip: Ask for high up with a view -- and let them choose one. Waiting for the elevator really is not that...

Recently stayed here while in the city to attend a birthday party. I love that this hotel was pet friendly and allowed us to bring our 10 year old lab along to stay over with us (without some crazy deposit or expensive fee) Our king room was quite tiny for the two of us and our dog but we weren't in there other than to sleep and shower the next morning so it was fine for the circumstances. I understand the hotel is undergoing a renovation so perhaps the rooms will be larger once it's done. We were slightly disappointed that the hotel did not have any room service but the front desk gave us the # for a local pizza place that delivered it directly to our room. All in all a good place for a quick overnight stay especially if you like to travel with your 4-legged family members.
"Was a little concerned after reading the occasional critical review, but overall was quite pleased with my stay. I am a light sleeper and requested quiet room. No issues--they assigned me a nice room and on the weekend it is in a much less traveled area than many River North hotels so I did not have to contend with street noise, fire trucks, etc.Loved the fact it was about a short 2 block walk from the Blue Line CTA from O'Hare and only 2 blocks from the downtown Avis car rental, which I needed for business. I also used the Blue line to check out some very cool, locals neighborhoods such as Wicker Park and Logan Square as well as the nearby Red Line to get to the Museum of Contemporary Art....very convenient. Also, short walk across the LaSalle, Wells, or Clark bridges to popular River north restos and sites.Room size was decent, nothing special but it suited my purpose. Bed was very comfortable. Would stay here again."
"We booked here to be downtown and found everything satisfactory, but not fulfilling. The king room was small and crowded. One desk chair, two small drawers and a miserable little closet. No counter space in bath. Gray walls and lots of neutral colors. There is a bright ceiling light and only two dim bedside lights. The room was expensive for us but probably reasonably inexpensive for this area. We will return because of its location but not because we enjoyed it much. There were no grab bars in tubs making them dangerous

"I stayed one night at the Allegro. It was booked for me for a business trip and was not my choice. I could not wait to leave. The room looks great on their site but when you open the door, I was shocked. Bright ceiling light, no room for two people, one desk chair, bed, desk and a small storage area. There is no place to sit. It is an old building with new obvious renovations.Garish wallpaper.The window faced other buildings so the window treatment stayed down adding to the closed in feeling. There was noise from the street but that was OK with me.The bathroom was so small! You could not put toiletries on the sink so I kept them in my suitcase.No room service is provided. I did ask to be moved and was ignored.There are two small closets and I was glad I did not need to unpack.They do have a nice lobby and maybe the room I was given is not typical but I would not recommend this hotel without more information.I see lots of postive reviews but this was not my experience.It is clean and the bed was OK but I could not overcome the feeling of claustrophobia which never happens and I travel frequently.The plus is they had good water pressure!

"We stayed here on the 2nd part of a 3 part honeymoon. We arrived late on a Sat evening to find there was a wedding on. I was half expecting for check in to be slow and the room to be noisy but was pleasantly surprised to find check in clear with the guy on the desk really chatty, friendly and informative. Our room was really quiet and clean with the decor kinda quirky and cool. A continental breakfast was included which was lovely. Choice of morning pastry along with bowl of fruit and juice and coffee. The bar closed early on Sunday which was strange. Other than that I would highly recommend this hotel, staff are great. Rooms really nice and location not too bad. Really enjoyed my stay would definitely come back"
"I came to Chicago for the opera and to visit friends. Alas, there was an air traffic debacle, my flight was cancelled, and I couldn't get rebooked until the next day. The staff at the Allegro was very helpful and allowed me to change my reservation with no question. The location of the hotel is really convenient: the opera house, The Art Institute, Millennium Park, theaters, river tours, good restaurants are all in walking distance. My room was a good size, clean, and comfortable. I will definitely stay here again."
"I stayed at Hotel Allegro last night and I was expecting better. The building facade was dingy. There is a small revolving door and a narrow doorway. Both doors and the glass were dingy. I didn't want to touch anything. The doorman or bellhop was not at his station because he was chatting and laughing with a coworker. He did notice me after I made it through the first door. The check in experience was slow. There were eight people ahead of me in line and two people working the desk. The hotel needs a good polishing. It's not dirty but it's not that clean and I am a stickler for clean. I'm really used to staying at much nicer hotels. There was an off putting scent in the hallway. The place just didn't smell that fresh. Upon entering my room, I was officially over it all. That same not so fresh scent was in the room as well. The wallpaper was dingy. I dropped my things off and went in search of a store so that I could purchase some air freshener. This hotel was chosen and paid for by the company I work for, this would not have been my choice at all."
"I. Looked this hotel via Priceline and wasn't sure what to expect, but I was pleasantly surprised. As expected, I didn't get the best room, being a priceline customer. I was on the top floor (19th) with insufficient elevators, so going up and down was time-consuming. There was a wedding going on the night of my arrival and there were many guests loudly clamoring in the hall throughout my night, yelling to one another and mistakenly trying the lock on my door, until about 4am Sunday morning. This wasn't appreciated but wasn't really the hotel's fault. Nevertheless, the doors and walls were pretty thin and sound definitely carried more than in most upscale hotels. Each evening, there is complimentary wine and beer in the lobby. The lobby was pretty crowded but was spacious, so I suppose the happy hour was just popular. They also had good coffee and tea in the morning, also complimentary. There was also a Starbucks in the lower lobby. They have an array of supplies in case you forgot your own, including lint rollers, nail clippers, flat irons, curling irons, and other things I don't usually see a hotel offer for this guests. The sheets had a chemical smell that was bothersome to me. There was a mini fridge in the small room; I appreciated the mini fridge because I didn't expect it in a room of that size. The surrounding neighborhood felt safe and was walking distance of the Michigan avenue shopping area and millennium park. I would stay again for a priceline deal, but wouldn't spend a fortune to stay."
"I generally like Kimpton hotels, but this one just seemed on the shabby side. I wouldn't say it was dirty, but it was dark and I just didn't like the overall vibe of it. My friend even had a suite and I just wasn't impressed. The trim work had about 8 coats of paint, felt like an old apartment building. The carpet was unraveling around the edges of the wall. The wallpaper was gray, the carpet was dark brownish and blue. It just felt gloomy. The people working there seemed nice enough, but nothing out of the ordinary. It's a decent location in the theater district and you could walk to restaurants and attractions, but I probably would not stay there again."
"Stayed at this hotel for a wedding. The concierge where excellent. They were very helpful in giving us direction because we walked to many places. Our check in experience was quick and very helpful with giving us advice on great places to eat in the area. The room was small but very modern and clean. We received an amazing rate on the room with the wedding party.

"I have stayed at this hotel in the past and I love it, but am not there now. Instead, we sent someone from my office to a conference in Chicago and Hotel Allegro was the conference hotel. My coworker had never been to Chicago before, whereas it is my hometown. To surprise her and help make her feel welcome, I called the hotel and asked if they could put together some sort of small ""Welcome to Chicago"" amenity package. Adam was my point of contact and I can't say enough about his response to this idea. He was creative with his suggestions, careful to stay within my very modest budget, incredibly responsive, professional, and accommodating. I gave him a general idea of what I wanted. He emailed me with a description of the final product (a combination of local Chicago delicacies). He thought of including some great items that I ever would have included on my own. He then personally made sure it was delivered and welcomed my coworker when she arrived. She called us later that night and was raving about her entire hotel experience. Way to go Kimpton! You are amazing and your staff goes above and beyond the call of duty!"
"This was our second visit to the Hotel Allegro and it was wonderful! We love the location of this hotel. It is within walking distance of great restaurants and entertainment, and also close to a train stop for easy access to things farther away. The rooms, while a bit small, are modern, clean and bright. The decor throughout the hotel is wonderful. The staff has always been friendly and accommodating, even offering great recommendations for restaurants, etc. when asked. We look forward to visiting again!"
"The staff at the Allegro were outstanding; we arrived from Tokyo early morning and the reception staff were extremely helpful, and arranged a room for us as soon as possible. Our room was a corner room, and very spacious and comfortable. The evening ""happy hour"" was fun, we really liked the quirky foyer, it went well with the ambiance of the hotel. The staff in the dining room were great, and full of personality - the food was very good as well. We were strangers to Chicago, and the reception staff were helpful in recommendations. Our three nights in the Allegro went by so quickly, we would certainly stay there again.


Room Tip: We were happy with our corner room

"We stayed at the hotel for 3 nights and found it to be clean and centrally located! The staff were lovely and helpful and the hotel had a lovely atmosphere and was decorated well! The room was bigger then I thought, having stayed in New York previously I thought the room would be a similar size however it was slightly bigger! The valet parking was expensive at $57 a day but probably on par with other hotels and the staff were great! The hotel is in walking distance to Millennium Park, Navy Pier and Magnificent Mile. I would definitely stay again if I visit Chicago!"
"I stayed in September at the Allegro. Having arrived at 22:00 I was asked ""as we have a capacity issue, would you be willing to transfer to another hotel"". In other words, we have opted to oversell our hotel.I advised no, and was give room 1825. If you stay and are offered 1825, or I presume any other room ending 25, be aware that it is right beside the elevator shaft and also the service corridor. I called to reception and was offered ear plugs. I don't care to pay for a hotel to put me in a room where they know I need ear plugs to sleep. I won't be back.


Room Tip: Avoid rooms ending in 25.

"I stayed at a Kimpton in Alexandria, Va and really enjoyed my stay so I booked this one for three nights . I expected a ""boutique"" hotel and this one was larger than what I expeted. I have no complaints about the hotel. The room was a little too small but pleasant. The location is outstanding being right downtown. The hotel does not offer a free breakfast but there are plenty of places close by. The staff were all pleasant and competent. There is an ""EL"" stop right around the corner."
"I stayed in Kimpton Allegro on Saturday night in July. I was able to get a reasonably good rate from Expedia - $200 with taxes for a king bed room. The check in time started at 3 pm. I arrived to the hotel at noon and a receptionist took my phone number and called me an hour later (while I was having lunch in a nearby cafe) to notify me that my room was ready. The room was on the 11th floor. There are only 3 guest elevators in the building and no matter time of day or night, they were always slow/ and full. So one time I ended up using a service elevator, after waiting for a guest elevator for more than 5 minutes. The room was clean and the bed was comfortable. Despite A/C being set to 65 degrees, the room felt dump and humid. The bathroom was small and the toilet was clogged. Before I used it for a first time I had to call maintenance to fix it. They did..and after flashing 3 or 4 sheets of toilet paper it clogged again!!! The ice machines were only on even floors and it so happened that the machines on 10th and 12th floors were out of ice, so it took me a while to fill the ice bucket. Despite the hotel being in a nice location, I would not stay there again... I never had to deal with a clogged toilet in the hotel, and it happened twice here...


Room Tip: Not sure - I specifically requested a room with a nice view, and got a room facing a facade of anoth...

"Nice, clean, comfortable hotel well located in downtown Chicago. Plenty of restaurants around and easy walk to Millennium and Grant Park. This convenience worked for us participating in the Half Marathon. The late afternoon wine and beer reception were a nice touch and well attended. We had a breakfast rate but found out breakfast was only for one night of the two nights we stayed.While the room and bed were fine, the rather small bathroom not so great. The sink faucet is so close to the fancy sink design you could hardly get your hands under the running water. The bathroom shelf was so narrow it was almost non-functional for putting anything on it. These bathroom issues are not big deals but the slow elevators were very annoying and frustrating. They became a standing joke as guests waited and waited and waited some more for them. And don't forget the parking fee ($50+ per night) which significantly increases the price of your room if you are traveling by car.


Room Tip: Some rooms have elevated trains running close so you can hear them. Just ask to be away from train...

"I bid on a weekend at Allegro in a silent auction and won. I only live a couple of miles away, but thought it'd be fun to have a laid-back weekend with my 9 year old son and our puppy. We stayed in a king suite and it was just great. Spacious, with a closed off bedroom and a living area with a pullout sofa. Modern decor, interestingly appointed, good amenities. Big windows, with windowsill seats and the Cadillac Theatre sign flashing in the window. Some people would't appreciate that, but we thought it was pretty cool. The staff is very professional and friendly. They really doted on my son and our dog and always greeted us enthusiastically.Overall it was good, but there were disappointments. Since we live in Chicago, all we really wanted to do was relax, order room service and watch movies in a comfy room. Well, the room delivered, but there is NO room service. There is a restaurant on the property, and there is a list of 6 or 7 things you can order and go down and pick up yourself. I also didn't see any in-room movies. I travel every week on business and am pretty used to the drill... if there were in-room movies I couldn't figure out how to watch them.Also, the neighborhood is dead, dead, dead on the weekends. The restaurant choices in the immediate vicinity are pretty sparse by Chicago standards. There are fast food places and a Starbucks, the 312 downstairs is fine and so is nearby Petterino's - but this just isn't a happening neighborhood. I absolutely wouldn't recommend against it for people who plan to be out and about around the city for the most part, but it just wasn't what I was looking for on this stay."
"I chose this hotel because I wanted a boutique experience and its proximity to the Loop. The room was clean but the decor was gaudy The front desk staff was some of the most rude I encountered both upon check-in and checkout. In the bathroom was a list of items that were available at the front desk if something was forgotten. When I inquired about an item that was listed, I was met with a rude response about how they didn't keep said item at front desk. I pointed out that it, in fact, claimed they did on their own printed card. Will not frequent again."
"I love this place. The atmosphere is very pleasant, and puts you in a good mood. There are hotels with bigger rooms in the City, but the overall vibe, atmosphere, and environment is worth the smaller space. The rooms are great by the way, just small by modern hotel standards. The amenities of the social coffee in the morning and the wine tasting at night are fun! I love this hotel and if you like something different, this is the place for you!"
"Stayed here with my son for 5 days very recently and found the hotel very easy, right off the subway line. Easy to check in but after that, there was just a lack of personal touch. Had to call down 4x to get our luggage delivered, no mention of the morning coffee/tea was made to me but I heard it repeatedly to others, no warm greetings as you passed staff. The rooms were clean, smaller in size (expected that). There is a Starbucks right downstairs but closes at 9 and there really is not much to eat around the hotel. Got a good deal on Priceline but if I had to pick an area of Chicago to stay in from now on, I would avoid downtown. Lincoln park would be my first choice."
"I have stayed at the Allegro twice now, and it is an excellent boutique hotel. The Allegro is a Kimpton, which means quality in my mind. I love the funky styling, and the decor in all the common areas. The staff is super friendly without being obtrusive. I love the location in the Theater District. There are some great choices for food nearby, including a couple take-out Indian restaurants, and a Hannah's Bretzel around the corner. You really can't beat this hotel for the price. I would gladly stay again.

"I went here with my husband and we had no complaints. The location is really great and nice area to walk everywhere you want to go in Chicago. Also, close to subway to get back to the airport. The staff was very friendly and the hotel itself is clean and inviting. The price is good for downtown Chicago and they have great hotel amenities and I love their brand of shower gels, shampoos, etc. Also, the maids were really friendly and left lollipops on our bed which no other hotel ever does. The room was comfy, and most of all the location was perfect.

"Other than the fact the rooms are tiny, the staff is friendly and everything is clean. It has a well stocked bar and was conveniently located about 12 mins from millennium park. I did however leave a brand new pair of shoes in my room when I was leaving. Brand new and boxed! ! I called to give a forwarding address and I was told that housekeeping had not submitted anything to security. I was really shocked and disappointed by this. For this reason I would not recommend or stay there again. Security is everything when you are travelling."
"My friends and I stayed over the weekend and we had a great time. Staff is outstanding. Quick customer service with a smile. The suite was huge, clean, and had a great view overlooking the Cadillac Palace Theater. There was no street noise in our room on the 11th floor. Wine Hour was a hit with my group and it was great meeting people from all around the world! My friends definitely want to stay at the Allegro when they come back :) PS--Caitlin the concierge is amazing!"
"Allegro was a beautiful hotel. I very much enjoyed our short stay there. It had everything I would look for in a hotel located in a big city. The staff were friendly and personable, the hotel was clean and centrally located to everything we wanted to see while in Chicago. The lobby was beautifully decorated. It had an old-style boutique feel. I felt like I stepped back into time to an earlier decade. Perhaps the 1940s. Every time I was in the lobby, it had fresh-flavored ice cold water for guests. One morning, the water was flavored with fresh limes and lemons and the second morning, the water was flavored with fresh raspberries. It was delicious and refreshing. The room was very reasonably priced. It was just under $200 a night. We stayed on the top floor of the hotel, floor 19. Our hotel room, Room No. 1907, felt like the size of a large closet, but it was clean, well decorated and the beds and pillows were comfortable. The bathroom in the room was tiny, as well. It was long and narrow. While standing in the middle of the bathroom, it would have been possible to stretch my arms out and place one hand on the far wall of the shower and the other hand on the mirror above the sink. If I stretched my hands in the perpendicular direction, I could place one hand on the wall behind the toilet and the other hand on the entry door to the bathroom. Without spending a small fortune, I expect hotel rooms in big cities to be small. Overall, I was very satisfied with the room. The room and bathroom were clean and comfortable, and the hotel's location was perfect. It was walking distance to every place we wanted to visit while in Chicago.If you have a vehicle, make sure to add the cost of parking the car to the price of the room. It was $57 per day to valet, which seemed astronomical until we went across the street and paid for public parking that was $40 per day."
"I will start with the pros:Comfortable bed.Spacious room but odd setup, a lot of wasted space. Gimmicky wine hour might be a pro for some.Good location for those doing business in the loop.Cons:Fitness Center - are you kidding me? It is tiny and packed, sigh. I went for a run outside instead. Large rooms - tiny bathrooms - ughWindows in my room were filthy.Decor is odd and looks unfinished. Felt cheaply done. Rudely bumped into by a janitor, given no apology."
"I had high hopes for this hotel but was disappointed. The Service and cleanliness were outstanding. The room was so small, it was hard for two people to move around comfortably. The walls between the rooms were paper thin. They offer great free coffee in the morning, flavored, cold water all day, and wine at happy hour. The decor is weird. It's deco 40's meets 60's, meets eclectic, giving it an identity crisis."
"This has for years been my go-to Chicago hotel - close to my company's offices and convenient for restaurants, etc. Today when I checked in, however, I was stunned to learn that room service had been eliminated. I expect a lack of in-room dining at a Comfort Inn, but not at a hotel of this caliber. As a business traveler I rely heavily on room service, especially for breakfast. Consequently, I will never stay here again. A real shame and, at least as to me, a big mistake on their part."
"Stayed in this hotel in late May, 2014 - with close friends. We were originally booked into the Millennium Knickerbocker - but for whatever reason they were unable to accommodate us, and we were moved to the Allegro! I have to say, I was super pleased about this - because I'm a huge Kimpton fan! My friends checked in the day before I did, and I arrived after they had stayed there one night. The rooms were well-appointed, albeit a bit small, and the beds were fairly comfortable. I particularly liked that they took into account the numerous devices people have these days, and put a giant powerhub in every room. Really thoughtful touch! Service at the hotel was impeccable - the staff are professional while still being personable. I totally love the wine reception that all Kimpton hotels have, it was nice to relax in the lobby with a glass (or three) of the wine, and a few nibbly things (the bruschetta was delightful). This hotel also has a Starbucks located conveniently in the lobby of the hotel, with a very friendly team working there. I would definitely consider staying at this hotel again in the future! I'd only wish for a bit of a larger room, and some more pillows on my bed!!


Room Tip: Request a larger room if you're travelling with friends, or have a bit of extra luggage. Usually...

"A clean hotel, looked like it had a recent makeover.... it was nicely designed, trendy decor, the rooms were clean but small. Only one chair for sitting. Our king size bed was a queen. Staff were friendly, they had good organic coffee each morning in the lobby. It was in a convenient location for theatre and the blue line to the airport

"My husband and I stayed here with another couple last Fall. The location is excellent for business travellers but is a little out of the way for those travelling to Chicago for leisure. This area of the Loop in particular is deserted after a certain time of night and on weekends. It is, however, only a 15-20 minute walk to the West Loop where there are a string of amazing restaurants (Blackbird, Girl & The Goat, Avec). As a former Chicago resident though, I was not worried about the location. The hotel is near a stop on the El, where you can easily hop on to get anywhere in the city. The rooms were clean. We were staying in a portion of the hotel that was under renovations/being redecorated but the rest of the hotel looked like the standard Kimpton Hotel."
"This hotel was beautifully decorated with great service. The location was close to Millenium park and many other attractions, trainstops,shopping and restaurants. We stayed in a suite that had a King Sized bed, huge Jacuzzi tub and a sitting room with a dining table and tv. I suggest calling the hotel direct and asking if they have any specials. We normally book online but called and got a better rate. I would highly recommend this hotel if you are coming to Chicago and want to be in a good , quiet location."
"great place for two girls, 11 and 12, to spend their first time in Chicago after taking the train from royal oak, mi. they loved the breakfast and the first words from maria afterwards was - can we eat here again tomorrow morning. ample room for the 4 of us, easily accessible to where we wanted to go to while there. wine hour was a great time for us adults to unwind from all that energy two soccer playing girls can emit.

"We went to Chicago to get married as our state does not preform same sex marriages. We stayed for a night as you get a marriage license one day and can marry the next. We really wanted to stay as close to the court house as possible so we would not have to rush through hectic traffic. You get your marriage license in one building and get married in a different building beside of it. Hotel Allergo was perfect, up scale, retro and posh. Our friends came over and there was plenty of intimate places to sit and talk. The courthouse was on the next block and closest hotel to the courthouse. I expected a small room, but our room was huge. The bathroom was small, but worked out just fine. Our friends suprised us with a photopher and we ended up taking pictures at the Hotel Allergo due to the beautiful decor. Staff were wonderful and for a small fee we were allowed to check out late. Valet parking at the hotel was cheaper than self parking at other places. Great shopping and restruants near by. Our only regret was rushing to self parking to get our marriage license and paying 30 dollars when we could have gone early to the hotel a block away and paid less."
"I stayed at the hotel for three nights in May. The location is good (right in the theater district and a few blocks from Michigan Avenue). The rooms are nicely appointed, and the hotel overall appeared to be in good condition. The Kimpton perks (free wifi, complimentary coffee service in the lobby in the mornings, a wine hour from 5-6) are nice. The rooms, however, are quite small. For one person, they are fine. For two, much less so. For example, although the closet in my room was efficiently laid out, it was basically half the size of an ordinary closet. I can't imagine storing clothing for two in it. Finally, the hotel is located close to an L track. Although it was clear that the hotel had tried to soundproof the rooms, I could tell when the trains started running. If I were to go back, I definitely would ask for a higher floor.


Room Tip: Ask for a room on a high floor, and one not near the L tracks.

"The hotel is located centrally with a nice lobby. Rooms are small but well appointed. We were told upon check-in that we had a king size bed, and being with my mother we requested two separate beds but they didn't have any other rooms available so we said okay to a king. Walking in to the room we were both immediately surprised by how small the bed was. So much so, we called and had them come up to check the bed size. It's no larger than the queen I have at home- 100% positive. Housekeeping came and checked and told us ""oh, this is our king size bed."" It's absolutely not a king size bed anywhere else in the world so be warned when checking in. Other than that the rooms were clean and the bathroom was small but well appointed. On the 10th floor we didn't hear street noise or train noise."
"We stayed over Mother's Day weekend and took in a play. The staff was very helpful and the restaurant, 312 Chicago, was so convenient. We enjoyed brunch and lunch at the restaurant. If you prefer a more intimate and quaint hotel, this one is it. There are plenty of sitting areas tucked away in the lobby that provide privacy for guests. Some features we really liked were: the television was large enough to see! If you wanted a coffee pot (Keurig type) for your room they had no problem giving you one. Plenty of hot water. Nice towels.

"As most have mentioned, the location is excellent. I would recommend this hotel for downtown accessibility especially if you are hitting some of the better known restaurants nearby; Sepia, Avec, Girl and the Goat, Gilt Bar, The Gage, Carnivale, etc, etc. There are of course many others. The hotel is fine. Very clean. Only problem I can think of, at least on the fifth floor, was the sound from the hallway and the bordering rooms. It wasn't the end of the world and I did not complain while there... but when you can hear everything next door to you and even quiet conversations in the hallway, sometimes that's a bit too much early in the morning while you're trying to sleep.


Room Tip: I think rooms on the east wall (away from the trains) might be your best bet.

"The service was very friendly when we checked in. We had just missed the wine hour, and the front desk gave us two vouchers for a glass of wine in the hotel bar. The location is ideal near the L and right in the Loop. You can easily get to the rest of downtown and river north walking. As with all Kimptons, there is coffee in the mornings and wine hour in the lobby. We received a NY Times at our door each day. WSJs were available free in the lobby too. The internet speed was excellent and free with our Intouch membership. Our room overlooked the L, but the double-pane windows ensured quiet and a good night's sleep. Randolph Street is a great place to stay with easy access to fabulous restaurants on the West Side (Avec, Girl and the Goat) and in the Loop (Do-Rite Donuts, Garrett's, etc.). A very nice Kimpton!"
"Bright warm room with a giant sized comfortable bed. Lifts fast . Restaurant for breakfast was very good and the waiters enjoyed their work as it showed. Staff on the desk helped a lot and the location was close to shops and churchesThe one down side was the free drinks at Happy Hour, which was OK if you drank wine, if you did not, tough luck, not even an orange juice.We would recommend this hotelColin and Helen Styring, Melbourne, Australia

"I stayed here for almost 2 weeks in April. While it was convenient and of course the staff was pleasant and friendly, it is not the best Kimpton in Chicago. It's older and dated and the bathroom is AMAZINGLY small. It's adequate at best. It's convenient to the river and EL.The restaurant associated with it is just ok, but the bartender was quite nice.If I had to stay again, I would, but I would argue for a different spot."
I was referred to the Hotel Allegro in Chicago for a business meeting and it was a very pleasant surprise to spend the night in a hotel with personality. I had signed up for the Kimpton free membership as offered on the website and discovered on arrival a $10 mini-bar credit for my membership. Not many hotel even offer mini-bars and this one was excellent for my missed lunch. Then at 5pm they hosted a complementary wine and passed nibbles in their lobby. It was a real wonderful social event. The rooms are lovely with character even my small bathroom had a lot of personality including a great shower. Definitely worth a visit.
"Stayed here for business for 3 nights and I was very surprised at how nice it was. Sort of a boutique hotel meets the W in a fun way. The staff is very friendly and they seem to go out of their way to make it comfortable and welcoming. The front desk was great, the bar was fabulous and the free wine at the end of each day is amazing. It was a great experience. Location is great, right near all the theaters and short walks or cab rides to anyplace you want to go downtown.


Room Tip: Ask for the king premium which is a king br plus living room suite with huge closet and bathroom.

"Since checking in at Hotel Allegro me and the 8 other people I was staying with fell in love with the staff and decor. It is a perfect hotel for groups, couples, and families. It is in a perfect location and accessible by public transportation and has TONS of eateries within walking distance. The room decor was fabulous as well and the hotel in general was very unique and clean, not to mention how incredible the FREE wine reception from 5-6pm every night was! I would stay at this hotel every time I visit Chicago. The staff was very accommodating as well :) Only downfalls were there not being a pool in the hotel and the shower was a bit hard to turn on, but nothing too negative!


Room Tip: Corner suites are great!!

"Stayed here for a weekend away. The room was small, but bigger than many other rooms I've seen in big cities. Our view was of the parking deck of another building, and there was often a wait for the elevators. These issues are negligible, and were the only ones we had. The staff was pleasant, the lobby a great place if you needed a place to meet or hang out. The bed was comfy and everything was clean. There is coffee and tea in the lobby and a Starbucks next door. There are tons of shops, theaters and restaurants nearby--we found it an easy walk to wherever we wanted to go--and the hotel is just a couple of blocks from the El. Also, the gym was really nice for a hotel this size with plenty of space and equipment. I'd gladly stay here again when we plan another weekend in Chicago."
"I recently stayed here on a business trip for 2 night. The room is small, but it was very clean and in a very safe location. My only real complaint about the room was the lack of an actual dresser with drawers. There's quite a mini-bar, but no dresser.The staff was just excellent. They were friendly, courteous and helpful; always a pleasure to talk to.The hotel is located next to the Cadillac Palace theater in a clean, safe neighborhood. There is a Starbucks on the ground floor (Hallelujah!) and a Dunkin Donuts within a 2 minute walk, in addition to several sandwich shops.Two restaurants to choose from, without walking outside of the hotel; 312, upscale Italian food, and Encore, American food (sandwiches, burgers etc.). I ate at both places and the service was impeccable.As mentioned, the rooms are very small, so I had difficulty concentrating on my work in the room. This was easily solved by the massive amounts of beautiful commons areas. I was able to grab a section of comfy couch, plug in my laptop and connect to the wi-fi.One detail that I was very pleased with was the ease of registering for the In Touch program (rewards). What I loved the most was that they sent my program number as a vcard, which I was able to save as a contact on my iPhone - not a little piece of paper or another plastic card cluttering up my wallet."
"We travel a lot but this was our first stay at a Kimpton property. The hotel is a lovely old property that has been refurbished very tastefully. The porter met us as soon as we parked in front and took our bags directly to our room. He offered to bring us a Keurig coffee maker for the room with coffee and tea pods. I honestly think he would have found anything we needed or forgot even if it meant a trip outside the hotel. I joined the Intouch rewards program and it was great! We were given a park and play rate that for $5 more that included in and out valet parking and were upgraded to a premium king room that was huge and included free internet.I love the yoga channels and yoga mat provided as well as the Lion and Tiger Bathrobes (my husband got a huge kick out of this). The bathroom is one person at a time but well lit (for make up) and has new fixtures with great water pressure with very nice bath products and thick towels. Our room was very quiet and the beds were so comfortable. Check out is at noon and we were not accosted by housekeeping before that. With intouch you receive a $10 raid the minibar coupon (we did!). Everyone can partake of the 5-6 pm wine hour that is served and you can sit in several beautifully (contemporary) decorated rooms. We talked with several other guests including some from Australia and really enjoyed that. We did eat at Chicago 312 but that is a separate (and positive) review. It is right next door to the Cadillac Theater. If you were here in the dead of winter you could stay, dine at 312, drink at Entourage and have a snack from there delivered to your room and never leave the Hotel. But if you wanted to venture out there are great choices nearby. Every single staff member we encountered was professional and went out of our way to make us feel comfortable and important."
"I've grown to fall in love with Kimpton hotels in the last couple of years -- great locations, fabulous facilities and impeccable service -- and unfortunately, Allegro disappointed a bit. Location was great for where I needed to be and the service was good. But there were a couple of imperfections that just didn't leave me with the same Kimpton experience.There was a conference being held at the hotel during my stay and the staff seemed a little overwhelmed. My room key was messed up at check-in so I had to run back down to the lobby with all my luggage after a long day of work and travel to get it resolved (could have happened in any hotel; it just added an extra annoyance). There was also a little mix-up with my luggage that I temporarily checked in with the bell staff on my check-out date -- luggage ticket given to me didn't match the luggage tag tied to my stuff so we had to manually look. The rooms were okay...I got lucky that I ended up with a corner room so it was larger than standard. However, the hike to the elevator was pretty far, the view was of the building right next door (it's okay, I just kept the shades closed) and the bathroom was tiny. So small, that the vanity was probably half the size of standard small bathroom vanities -- faucet was only a smidge away from the edge of the sink that washing my hands and face always left quite a puddle and water marks everywhere. Comments about the thin walls were accurate, but wasn't as bothersome for me since my room was located at the very end of the hallway and didn't experience much foot traffic. When there were people walking outside my room however, I could clearly heat it. Finally, the elevators were sloooooooooooooow. There were only two small ones, and because of the conference, there was a constant back-up.On the bright side, the room provided nice amenities -- like a yoga mat and an umbrella, both of which I used daily. They also provided the daily wine reception in the lobby, although I didn't take advantage this time because of the crowd.Overall, still not up to par with what I've known Kimpton to be able to provide."
"Our room which we'd booked for 3 nights was located next door to one of the Hotel Allegro's suites that was unfortunately occupied for the first 2 nights by the worst sort of Demon Guests, the kind who start the party in the hallway at 2:30 a.m. and continue with loud talking, music, and energetic seduction on into the daylight hours. The first night a call to the front desk and the subsequent visit to the neighbors by Security took care of the problem. The second night, I called for a Security visit after the party had been going on for an hour. (Silly me, I seem to want to give these noisemakers the benefit of the doubt ....) The Security person seemed to give up after a light tapping on the door didn't get the occupants' attention, so I called the front desk again. The receptionist offered to move us to a different room. Really?! At 4 a.m.? Just an option, she said. Security person came again and was more aggressive with the Demon Guests, threatening to boot them out if they didn't shut up. By 5 a.m. they'd gone quiet. After two more or less sleepless nights I wanted some sympathetic compensation from the management. James A. explained that since we'd booked thru a 3rd Party it was difficult to give us a refund. He did, however, comp us for dinner at the hotel which fortunately has an excellent restaurant, and offered us an upgrade the next time we visit. Because we really enjoyed everything else about the hotel -- location, lobby and wine scene, comfy bed -- we might well return. In fact, the last night of our stay, there were new occupants in the suite next door but they made no noise at all and we slept 11 hours in the delicious silence. Since I know (and appreciate) that the hotel reads these reviews, I'd suggest that the management check in with guests if they've had a problem in the night. If we'd known after making our first complaint that the suite would have the same occupants on our 2nd night, we might well have appreciated a room change. To offer a room change in the middle of the night, however, is much too little, and way too late to make a difference.


Room Tip: Based on my experience, I'd avoid a room located next to one of the suites. Maybe it's the l...

"I stayed at the Allegro for a huge convention and I suspect at least a few of the other guests were there for the same reason. Let me just say my favorite thing about this hotel was wine hour. From 5-6pm the hotel hosted an in-lobby mix and mingling hour with free wine. Now, I'm already sold on the concept of ""free wine,"" but really what this did was just create an aura of warmth and friendliness to the lobby. I travel a lot for business, and tend to just get caught up in Work-room-work-room and this was just the most pleasant break from all that. The decor is fabulous and the staff is friendly and helpful.My only complaint about this hotel (and it might be just due to age) is the thin walls. When my next door neighbor conducted a business meeting on the phone at 6am, it sounded as if he were in my room. I learned a lot about spectroscopy that morning. Several times I became temporarily alarmed at what sounded like the shower turning on in my bathroom (when in fact, it was my neighbor--- or a ghost?). That said, I had a room facing the interior of the block, so I experienced absolutely no street noise. Overall I have to recommend this hotel. It was the most fun hotel experience I had on a business trip. Great location, within walking distance to many tourist sites -- Willis Tower, Millennium Park, many theaters, pizza.


Room Tip: Interior room had no street noise.

"The staff here is WONDERFUL!! From the moment you disembark your taxi, they are helpful and smiling and can't seem to do enough to make your stay a success. Want a taxi? Got it! Need a spoon to take some medication? It's brought right up! Have a question? It's answered! That kind of staff. The accommodations are extremely nice. Good sized room, comfortable beds, nice continental breakfast right on each floor. Reception each evening with snacks and drinks. The location is River North, but it's literally just north of the river. We WILL stay here again, as the location is very central to things."
"This hotel was a last minute find in the area that I wanted to be in. What a quaint, hip hotel. The front desk was very nice and helpful of where we could get something to eat close by. The room was very nice, beds comfortable, everything is up to date. They had a happy hour on our floor which was great. In the morning, every floor has a ""continental"" breakfast. It is located in front of the elevators which is a little strange but hey, my sister and I got our food (we were in our P.J.'s HAH) and took it back to our room. The parking is expensive, so we did spot hero and got it almost half the price very close by.

"I recently stayed at this hotel on a visit to Chicago and I can say it was fantastic. We arrived on St Patricks Day and the whole city was a wash with green! it was great to see and although the partying went on throughout the night in the city this did not affect my room, it was still very quiet despite being in the middle of the city.My room was large, spotless, ample sitting area, wifi, beautiful bathroom and huge bed! Coming from the UK and staying in America I always the big beds!!Service was great from the front desk, we purchased tickets for the Sears Tower which saved us standing in line plus they were cheaper! Whenever we asked for assistance we were not disappointed.When I heard breakfast was served on each floor I didn't know what to expect but I wasn't disappointed and I actually enjoyed being able to grab what I wanted and take it back to my room and finish getting ready for the day. Food was fresh and coffee nice and strong!Thanks for your hospitality!!"
"My daughter and I recently had a shopping trip to Chicago and stayed here. I have never stayed here before and overall it was pretty nice. The weather wasn't the best so I would say that shopping all the way down towards Water Tower Place was a challenge if you wanted to walk it. We did end up taking a taxi a couple of times and that was reasonable.The valets were very friendly here and helpful. I would say the people behind the front desk, not so much. I didn't feel any warmth from the two people that assisted me directly, both on check-in and check-out. The lobby here, as others have said, is really tiny. It reminds me of an apartment lobby in feel and appearance. It's not bad, but not really what I'm used to in terms of curb appeal. I love the boutique aspect of this place though. Our room was very nice and modern and the bathroom was a roomy size with a good shower. We did have an issue with our toilet running the two nights that we were there. I think they came into our room to fix it, but the issue remained. I mentioned it upon check-out and the woman helping me was very disinterested. The hotel itself was pretty quiet even though it appeared full when we were there. The view from our room was fine; nothing too special there. We liked the breakfast on each floor and being able to bring the tray back into our room. That is the only option as there aren't any tables out by the elevator. We missed the ""happy hour"" both nights so can't comment on that.Overall, pretty nice but I wasn't blown away. I think some of that was due to the lack of service we received while we were there. Might try somewhere else next time."
"This was our second stay here, our first stay was about two years ago when it was called the Amalfi. We had a great stay last time and really wanted to stay here again. They've remodeled and it's really modern looking now. They kept the morning breakfast on each floor and the nightly happy hour... two features that we really enjoyed. They have a good location, and their service has been great. It's been a pleasure working with Melissa and all the staff here, would definitely stay here again!"
"What a magnificent hotel! If you think that big city means that people are unfriendly and uncaring and impersonal, then you are wrong! The entire staff at this hotel went out of their way to make our stay extremely comfortable. We were in town for the pleasure of seeing Chicago for the first time. The location is excellent, the rooms are spacious and very clean, the cute little tokens for a free drink at night and the incredible breakfast buffet made this stay exceed ANY expectations that I had. Rafi was helpful anytime we needed car service or just general walking directions! I will definitely stay here again because I loved Chicago and loved my accommodations!

"We were met at the curb by a gentleman/doorman who took our luggage. Check in was fast and easy, great experience. Room was 327 3rd floor in front with view of Harry Caray's. Large room, comfortable bed and pillows with window seating (looks just like all the photos) Bathroom was super large, great water pressure, good make up lighting with an added makeup mirror, ample counter space. Free breakfast every morning and seemed to be plenty, also free drinks on 6th floor (we never made it up) but appreciate free drinks! Stayed 3 nights for St Patty's weekend (craziness in this city) but each lobby person said Hi and asked if we needed anything when we entered the lobby. Super nice employees! Location is great, close to everything touristy and within walking distance to transit. I loved our stay here, would def stay again. Only issue I had was outside noise of the city (not the hotels fault) we were on the 3rd floor so close to ground level. I'd bring sleep earplugs if staying inside city center.


Room Tip: I'd say ask for higher floors, and bring sleep earplugs all cities are noisy.

"Modern boutique hotel with a bargain price and over-the-top perks for it's customers. The rooms were spacious and clean and the decor was chic and modern. Our room had a giant wall of windows looking out to the famous Marina City circular towers, which were just a few blocks away. We received tokens for free drinks at the nightly welcome happy hour reception for all guests, so decided to go have a glass of wine shortly after checking into our room. There is a separate lounge on the upper level floors dedicated to this nightly ritual. We were pleasantly surprised to find a nice cozy space with a bar, high tables and chairs, tv screens and a beautiful spread of bruschetta, cheeses, crudites, and a few warm bites like meatballs in marina....all free of charge! We thought this was such a nice welcoming touch and had never seen anything quite like it at any other hotel. The hotel staff were all extremely helpful and welcoming as well. The front desk staffer who checked us in was feeling generous and gave us 2 tokens apiece (shh!) for the happy hour drinks, instead of just one, when we told her why we were in town. As someone who has worked in customer service most of my life, I think these little touches go a long way in creating a very positive first impression and ensuring a possible return customer. The treats just kept coming the next morning when a continental breakfast spread was set up in the empty space in front of the elevators on each floor. Once again, a nice touch and even nicer that you don't have to leave your floor (or your pj's!) for a treat and cup of coffee first thing in the morning! Great experience at this hotel and I highly recommend it to others and look forward to a return visit soon!"
"The staff at the Kinzie are always on top of things and do whatever they can to meet your needs. The room was clean and stocked well, and the bed pretty comfortable. Everything worked as expected. The morning ""light breakfast"" is fine and saves from having to find somewhere to eat, if all you really need is coffee, juice, fruit, danish/donut, etc. The evening receptions are quite nice with some finger snacks (cheeses, crackers, salami, etc) and a free drink or two. I am staying at this location many times this year and look forward to returning.

"Kinzie booked my husband and I last-minute when another hotel had disappointed. The accommodations were very nice, clean, great location, competitive rates. Breakfast and happy hour were very nice perks. Overall, this hotel is not flashy when you enter the lobby; they've put all of the effort instead into thoughtfully making the guests stay enjoyable.


Room Tip: Higher floors would be better, lower ones are very visible from the street.

"This hotel is a jewel. Great location close to the Chicago river and just a few blocks to Michigan avenue. The room was delightful and well appointed. The beds were comfey as well the best part and totally unexpected was the continental breakfast laid out on each floor. There was no need to traipse to the lobby. Plenty of coffee,yogurt,fruit and pastries. Just take the tray from your room, get what you needed and return to enjoy in privacy. There was a happy hour in the lounge even on Saturday night with delicious anti pasta,cheese and crackers. I would go back in a heart beat."
"I booked 1 night at the Kinzie using a Groupon, confirming via phone the week before our stay. The receptionist told me we had a King Suite. Upon checking in, we were greeted promptly by a bellhop and receptionist. There were cookies and a Keurig available at the front desk for guest use. When we checked out, we were hoping to see that Keurig again but it was sadly gone. Must only be out for check-ins!We each got 1 token for the nightly manager's reception and went up to our room. Unfortunately, it was immediately outside the elevator and I wouldn't call it a King ""Suite"". It seemed to me to be a regular room with a king-size bed. Maybe that's where they put the Grouponers? However, we did love the decor and had a decent view from the window. I was also hoping we'd get lucky with our cocktail tokens seeing as other reviewers got more than just 1, but no luck!We made it to the reception shortly after it began and it was busy! The bartenders were friendly and we were impressed with the selection and the appetizers. Not something you see everyday! As for the breakfast, there was a decent selection laid out but 1) it is RIGHT outside the elevator so, again, having our room there was a bit loud, and 2) there wasn't much if you're not a pastry/cereal-lover. Thankfully I was able to grab an apple and a string cheese on my way out.While it was fun to try something different, I probably wouldn't go back to the Kinzie if I paid full price. Knowing what the Groupon was for a Thursday night, I'm scared to know what it is regularly! That being said, the location is great and the happy hour makes it a fun atmosphere.Note that we did not need parking as we took the Blue Line from the airport, but if we did, it is $62 for in & out privileges.

"I just arrived at the hotel today. It is a nice boutique hotel in the river north district. The hotel is very clean. Staff was nice and helpful. The beds are nice and cozy. Rooms are spacious. My room came with two queen beds and a small chase chair along the window. There is a continental breakfast in the morning which consist of frozen boiled eggs, cold pastels, bagels, cereal and fruit. There are plenty places to eat nearby though so don't let that turn you off. I took an 8 minute walk to Michigan Avenue and took the hop on/hop off Trolley tour. If you get a chance do it, it's worth it. Almost forgot, managers reception from 5-7 (I think) with snacks and drinks on the 6th floor. I would have given the hotel four star bc of the cold breakfast but.... I'm going to give them a five bc I'm just cool like that. I won't cry over free breakfast. ;-) Hope you enjoy your stay, I am enjoying mine. (Video enclosed)"
My wife and I loved staying at the Amalfi so we were a bit disappointed when we found out that the hotel was changing to the Kinzie. When I booked our room I was surprised to find that they had retained the records of the Amalfi and knew our favorite room. The staff was fantastic and very friendly. They even gave us extra tokens for happy hour drinks since we were celebrating our anniversary. The new decor is actually better than the Amalfi and looks great. I really loved the new motorized blinds instead of the curtains. This really made the windows fantastic on the suite. I will be back to my favorite hotel in Chicago. Great location to walk to shopping and attractions.
"I wanted to love this hotel, but I just didn't. The price and location are good, and the room was clean. The robes were lovely, bed was comfy, and the cocktail hour was a nice touch. If you're looking for a comfortable, affordable room near Wacker, it's fine. I didn't hate it.But the details just didn't add up. The graycale decor seems to aim for industrial-chic but feels dark and oppressive. There was no fan in the bathroom, and no sink outside the bathroom, so once the first guest takes a shower, forget about using the bathroom mirror. I took the hair dryer out into the room to try to save time while my partner showered, but there was no outlet near the mirror in the room. Since we normally come to Chicago to attend theater events, the fact that we can't get ready to go efficiently is a bigger problem than you'd imagine.Breakfast was laid out on a shelf on each floor, across from the elevators, so you're carrying your food back to your room to eat -- only there's no table in the room, so don't think you'll be sharing a cup of coffee together or talking during breakfast. One of you can sit at the counter-height desk while the other balances a plate on their knees on the little sofa. Not very cozy or romantic.These are small details, but when we come to Chicago for a big romantic date night, they really have a negative impact on our experience."
My family stayed here recently and had a fabulous experience! This hotel is a little gem. The rooms have all been recently renovated and the decor is clean and modern. Loved it! I found the staff to be friendly and helpful and the hotel had extra touches such as hot cocoa and cookies at check-in. The location is great too...just a quick walk from Michigan Avenue. We would certainly stay here again without hesitation.
"Booked a stay at the Kinzie Hotel for family Christmas 2014. Great welcome and visually attractive, however, the hotel upkeep is less than appealing. The shower was filthy. Mold and mildew and hair throughout the bathroom. The bedding was in poor shape and tattered. On checkout, I received extra charges of $200 for damages to the room, after I complained to the hotel staff about the condition of the room. I have made numerous calls to hotel management at the Kinzie to no avail. I have yet to receive a response or credit back to my credit card for the error! WARNING.....there are MORE attractive hotels to stay at in the area. The EMBASSY SUITES/WESTIN is a GREAT location and full service hotels that are more attentive to their customers needs. At the KInzie you are sure to be IGNORED and OVERCHARGED!!"
"We wanted to go downtown Chicago and spend the night at a hotel that was close to the things we wanted to do. We found the Kinzie Hotel, which we never stayed at before, and booked it online at $107 plus tax. Took the train downtown and walked about a mile to the hotel and checked in early with no problem. The rooms were very modern and comfortable, even though we weren't going to spend much time there. They had a welcome reception where they offered one complimentary drink each at like 5 to 8:00pm on the sixth floor and free continental breakfast on each floor by the elevators. This worked out perfectly since we wanted to go to RPM, Harry Carey's, Ruth Chris, Howl at the Moon, Dick's Last Resort and the Dailey Plaza. Everything was within walking distance and would not hesitate to go back, we had a great time."
"Kinzie hotel is an excellent value hotel. The rooms are clean and confortable, they use their space very efficiently. The hotel has a great location, within walking distance of the miracle mile and some other great places in Chicago. They offer some tokens for free drinks at the bar which would provide some warmth before heading out in to the cold downtown streets however this should not be seen as a destination more as the first step towards a night out. Great little hotel that does its job right and does not pretend to be more than it is."
"We have stayed at the Kinzie several times when it was the Amalfi...first time since new ownership and remodeled...love the decor of the rooms...very modern and comfortable...bed was first class...previously the 'happy hour' was unlimited complimentary drinks but now it's only one per person so new ownership has become more 'stingy'...while I don't expect two hours of freebies the cutback...

"Stayed at the Kinzie for 5 nights in August and what a great hotel it is! The room was spacious, clean & modern with everything you need. All staff were helpful & pleasant & the added bonus of a free drink every evening in the small cocktail bar was most welcome! Self service breakfast on each floor allowing residents to enjoy a leisurely breakfast in their own room was different & may not appeal to everybody; we loved it! Excellent central location with many bars & restaurants in the vicinity and a 2 minute walk from the 'L'. Free wifi too! Great value for money & would definitely stay here again."
"The Kinzie is a nicely located, and well run independent hotel in the River North neighborhood of downtown Chicago. Although it does not have a large lobby or amenities of many larger, chain hotels, it is a contemporary, attractive, personally-friendly and comfortable property. In the case of our stay, it was also an excellent value for the three nights that we stayed there. As guests, we very much appreciated the personal attention and hospitality we received from nearly everyone on staff, including a very attentive young bellman named Gerry, who was eager to make our stay more enjoyable. The complementary breakfast arrangement is very efficiently arranged, as it is set up on every floor adjacent to the elevators, for easy access from one's room. In the late afternoon/evenings, the hotel offers a complimentary happy hour including cocktails and light hors d'oeuvres on the top floor. The bartender does a nice job managing this every evening. While there is no bar or restaurant located within the hotel, there are many choices located in easy walking distance within the River North neighborhood. The rooms were comfortable and well appointed, albeit not particularly large. We will return to the Kinzie for future stays when we visit Chicago.


Room Tip: Ask for rooms on the side/floor that do not look directly into the office building less than 50 feet...

We stayed for 3 nights 11th to 14th August. The staff were most helpful and pleasant. The bed was super comfortable. Everything was spotlessly clean. Breakfast was buffet style available on all floors and you brought it back to the room. Unusual but great. WIFI was free and Concierge was really good (from Sri Lanka and ordered our taxi for six people at a decent rate. Hotel is near to boat cruise and tour pickup points - just past the Trump tower and over the bridge. Would definitely return and will recommend to friends who may be visiting Chicago.
"We had a very good stay. Very clean, new furnishings, comfortable beds. In a great location. You can walk to most of the architecture gems along the river. No need to pay for the tours.Gym was ok. Could have used some resistance bands and an exercise ball, but adequate overall.Breakfast is continental and served on your floor to take back to your room. As continental goes, above average.Overall, we'd come back and recommend"
"My husband and I first visited the Kinzie hotel during our first visit to Chicago in 2009 when we were dating. The location was amazing, the staff were extremely helpful and we loved the continental breakfast and cocktail hour that was included. The rooms are very comfortable and charming. Fast forward four years to 2013, my now husband was planning to propose and decided that he had to bring me back to Chicago and the Kinzie hotel! He woke me up and told me we were going on a road trip and when we arrived in Chicago 7 hours after departing Toronto and pulled into the Kinzie hotel I was thrilled! Needless to say, the Kinzie hotel is a very special place and we very much look forward to going back to celebrate many anniversaries!"
"We stayed at the Kinzie last week for 4 nights for our honeymoon. We had an amazing stay! The staff were so friendly and attentive. When we arrived we were early and our room wasn't quite ready. We left for about an hour for lunch (while they held our luggage for us!) and when we came back it still wasn't ready. However, they got us into another room right which was wonderful! Everytime we entered or exited the hotel we were greeted and told to have a wonderful day. Just a nice touch that you don't get at larger hotels. We were on the 5th floor with a street view and of Harry Caray's Steakhouse restaurant. The location is fantastic. We walked to pretty much everywhere we wanted to go (except Wrigley Field and Union Station). At check in we had some troubles with our Canadian credit/debit cards working and they were very accommodating. The same issues came up on our second last day, and again they were extremely accommodating and friendly while we solved the issue.They were aware it was our honeymoon, and when we returned from the Cubs game on our first night, we were greeted with a bottle of sparkling wine and chocolate covered strawberries along with a lovely note congratulating us on our marriage. Again, so nice.The bed was SO comfortable, and while the room was not huge there was everything you needed and everything was very stylish and updated. The extra perks made the stay. The continental breakfast on each floor was great. It wasn't something that we wanted every morning but had it a few times. There was juice, donuts, bagels, muffins, coffee, tea (all kinds of tazo tea), fruit etc. The reception from 5-8 was wonderful! They had different snacks (cheese, meat, bread etc) as well as a full bar. I was expecting small drinks and little selection however, this was NOT the case.Overall, I highly recommend staying at the Kinzie, it was a great experience and much more reasonably priced than other alternatives. I will be staying at the Kinzie again, and will be recommending it to anyone I know travelling to Chicago!


Room Tip: Ask for a higher floor - and a corner room would be nice!

"This is a beautiful hotel in a perfect location .. You can walk to most of the best locations in the city ... The rooms at the Kinzie are very nice and well decorated.. It provides a breakfast every morning and has happy hour every evening. You receive a free drink token when you check in. Another bright spot with this hotel is the staff ""especially the check in staff"".. It was perfect for a weekend in the city.."
"Staying at the Kinzie is a great way to introduce yourself to Chicago and immerse yourself immediately into the food and art scene of the downtown area. Location is very convenient for exploring and ambling around.It's a small boutique hotel with a clean, modern vibe that's warmly welcoming...a feeling I thought was whimsically represented by the minty-blue H2O+ square soap sitting on the cool, stark white dish in our bathroom. The grey/white walls are decorated with framed photographs of vintage scenes as well as fun modern art pieces which could include the funky furniture in the lobby. The Kinzie staff is friendly and attentive, always greeting you on the way in and out. The bellhops are very dapper in their light grey uniforms and fedoras. Fresh fruit flavored water is available in the lobby.Yays:- Free breakfast is served on each floor from 6:30 to 10 am, set up right across from the elevators. How convenient is that? You'll see your neighbors in their white bathrobes out examining the continental breakfast choices: pastries, bagels, breads, cereal, fruit, hard boiled eggs, coffee, juice, tea, yogurt. There's a white tray in your room that you can take with you to carry all your selections back for a leisurely breakfast in bed moment. - The free Manager's reception in the evenings is on the 6th floor with open bar (you're given a token for a free drink when you register) and a tasty assortment of appetizers. It's a low-lit, intimate setting with bar tables and chairs.- Everything was clean and comfortable...the room, beds, decor.- Our room had two queen beds-- a choice not offered at many hotels but very appreciated by families.- Location is excellent: great access to restaurants and Michigan Avenue. 5 minute walk to Grand metro station where you can catch the Red line to Wrigley Field, 10 minute walk to Millenium Park (""Bean"", Cloud Gate) and a little further to the fantastic Art Institute of Chicago museum. - Considering the hotel is on a main street right in the middle of downtown, you would think you'd hear a lot more street noise. Our room was on the 5th floor and we heard more from the ice machine across the hallway. There is street noise, just not as much as expected.- The small gym is located on the 5th floor which was very convenient for us.Nays:- We traveled at peak time so prices were higher, but still better than many other hotels nearby.- That we couldn't stay longer!Interesting:- Kinzie has a very pet-friendly policy with rooms and services geared towards furry guests. For those of us who are unfortunately allergic to man's best friend, you should ask for rooms on the non-pet floors.Staying at the Kinzie helped make our visit to Chicago more enjoyable and accessible...would definitely come back!"
"Location is very central. Close to pickup point for river cruises and city bus tours. Ten minutes to Millenium park ('the bean!) Hotel staff very very helpful especially the concierge from Sri Lanka who organised our transfer for us. Nice continental breakfast included, available from 6.30am until 10am on each floor to be taken back to the room. Unusual idea but great! There is free WIFI. Most comfortable bed I have slept in on any trip. Top marks for that! We stayed with our daughter and her husband. We would recommend and we would definitely return if in Chicago again."
"We recently came to Chicago to get married & do some research for work ( I know, what an odd combo, right? lol). Decided upon the Kinzie from all of the positive reviews on here. Since we had a morning incoming flight, I called two days before hand to see if the hotel might be able to let us check in earlier, to make it easier on us. I spoke to Meg & she said that she would make a note & try her best. We arrived earlier than planned & when we came to the font desk, Meg (who I spoke with on the phone) was working. She kindly explained that our room was not quite ready yet, but she could call us when it was. No biggie. The hotel held our bags while we got our marriage license, ate some breakfast & did some exploring of the city. We headed back to the hotel a few hours later & our room was up graded to a corner suite. We were so impressed by the awesome view of the city! We did a quick clothes change & headed out to do more site seeing. Before leaving, we thanked Meg for the beautiful upgrade. When we came back to the room a few hours later, there were chocolate covered strawberries, a bottle of champaign chilling & a very sweet note congratulating us on our wedding. I was so impressed that she remembered our conversation & took the time to arrange such a kind gesture. A class act, all the way. It made our stay & special day that much more memorable. In addition to the first class customer service, the nightly manager's happy hour is also a great perk. I enjoyed a few tasty cocktails. We will for sure be staying here again & will spread the word to our friends. The Kinzie & its employees know how to do it right!"
"Our family has stayed at The Kinzie Hotel numerous times (also when it was The Amalfi) and we have always been impressed. From family trips to Chicago or a weekend getaway for my husband and I, we have always had top notch service. The hotel is in a great location in River North, easy to get to everything on foot or by public transportation. For those driving, there is parking a block away. The staff is professional, courteous, and always goes above and beyond to make our stay memorable. Rooms are spotless, beds are super comfortable! We love the continental breakfast on each floor too! For anyone looking to stay in the heart of it all at a lovely hotel with affordable rates, The Kinzie is for you!"
"I would give this this hotel a 4.5. Not PERFECT but pretty damn near perfect. I will preface that I like writing reviews about what could be better, why I liked it, and if I would stay again.First of all, when booking I was disappointed because on the hotel website it says they offer a ""Best Price Guarantee,"" well they kinda DON'T. If you book the lowest rate, prepaid, they do not price match that. They had a better rate literally 12 hours after I booked. I contacted them and they said they don't offer the ""Best Price Guarantee"" on that rate. One of my biggest pet peeves in the world is air conditioning in hotels. Kinzie's air conditioning is not the best. It's confusing, doesn't go very low, and doesn't offer a fan option so air can get stagnant quick. I asked the front desk if I was using the air conditioning right because it has a very weird set up. You have to set up the outside air, and inside air, I have no idea if one affected the other. Anyways I asked the front desk how to use it, and they suggested that they send up an air conditioning engineer. We were on our way out and didn't want to wait, so partially our fault. I think the front people should be able to answer this basic question though. To best honest though we also experimented and thought we found the right ""mixture"" and it still wasn't great. The other things that really didn't bother me but it might bother others. First, the continental breakfast was ok at best. First morning they offered orange juice, second morning, cranberry, no orange juice. From what I can tell they didn't really replenish anything, so if it was gone when you get there, you'd either have to go scavenge on another floor (breakfast is served on every level) or call maybe? One morning I took the last cup, one morning there was none of the tea I wanted. No cold water. There was hard boiled eggs, cereal, fruit (bananas, apples), pastries, and bagels. They offer a managers happy hour, but I honestly had no idea where it was? We had some drink tokens but had no idea where to go. Also had no idea where the gym was. There were no maps in the rooms to tell people where these things happen. The lobby and front desk was often VERY VERY busy (pretty small) and we didn't see fit to wait, and bother to find out where these things were at. We were rarely in our hotel room so it wasn't a big deal.What I liked: everything else! The rooms were decorated well, the bed was super comfy, the couch was comfy, shower head(s) were great, they provided robes that were very comfortable. I loved the flavored water they offered every night in the lobby. The location was P-E-R-F-E-C-T, we walked to the River, Millennium Park, restaurants, bars, there is a CVS close by, shopping, train stations, we had more than enough to do within walking distance. The Bellmen were always one step ahead, and super friendly.Would I say there again? The air conditioning bothered me a lot. The location was primo but there are a ton of hotels in the area. I wouldn't not stay there again, next time I go to Chicago I'm going to look around, but will probably start out with Kinzie."
"Fantastic boutique hotel in a fantastic location. We were looking for a great place to stay for the weekend for a reasonable rate - we found it! This hotel is awesome. Nightly managers reception with cocktails and appetizers - all excellent by the way. Also, continental breakfast on each floor every morning. The reservations Supervisor Amanda knew is was out anniversary and surprised us with a bottle of champagne and chocolate strawberries upon our arrival. I would recommend this hotel to any traveler... We'll be back for sure!


Room Tip: King room was excellent - super large bathroom - shower was fantastic

"This was a very relaxing hotel! They had crisp clean sheets, plush huge bath sheets, bath robes, super clean rooms. There was a managers reception every night for drinks and snacks. After long days of site seeing it was great to go back to such a great room. It's a smaller hotel so there is no crowded lobby and long wait for elevators. Continental breakfast was on each floor. They provided a good variety and it was nice just to step around corner from your room and then go back to eat and relax in your room; very informal and minimizes the crowd. I loved it. The staff was accommodating and helpful to suggest travel routes and site seeing. Very modern and again, super clean!

"Our stay was one notch shy of perfect thanks to the very rude lady MEG at the front desk. I can't say enough good about every single other staff member at Kinzie, but Meg was not someone who should be working the front desk. We called around 2 p.m. to ask if our room might be ready early (prior to the 3 p.m. check in time). We were told it would not be. No problem, we walked around and ate lunch and came back at 3:45 to check in. Our room was not ready. Without any explanation, we were made to wait until 4:20 to check into our room. Had we known our room would not have been ready when it should have, we could have kept exploring downtown instead of sitting in the lobby for 35 minutes wasting our time tending to our luggage and waiting for a room to be available. Once our room was ready, Meg came over to our group, told us she could give us our room keys but we'd have to walk slow because there was a repair man fixing a light bulb. She didn't once apologize for the wait, or say she was sorry the room wasn't ready on time. A simple apology would have gone VERY far with us, but she was just kind of short and curt from the moment we walked in. She was rude again when we check out three days later - just not someone we wanted to deal with. ENOUGH ABOUT CRABBY MEG - everything else about the Kinzie was TOP NOTCH and excellent! From location to amenities, the bell hop and breakfast - we loved our room and everything about the Kinzie! Visited the fitness room one morning for a workout - it was lovely with TVs on the cardio equipment, clean towels and purified water for your workouts. The morning breakfasts on each level is really a great idea. We loved walking down in our PJs and getting breakfast to bring back and enjoy in the comfort of our room. The beds were SO comfortable. The location was perfect. We literally walked everywhere! Buckingham Fountain, Millennium Park, Navy Pier, Michigan Ave., State Street, Rush Street - you name it, we walked to it. I would absolutely recommend the Kinzie!

"Initially, when we booked Kinzie through hotwire.com in a secret deal, we were a little skeptical. Nobody knew the revamped, renamed boutique hotel. But, we hoped for the best, and went ahead to request an upper floor, corner room. When we checked in, late at night, the receptionist assured us it was a lovely room. I squealed with delight. We were on the 6th floor and had windows on three sides. What was unimportant is that the windows looked straight into the hotel opposite, but, hey, we had the road in between. Nice, large bathroom, except that it was not well planned. Nothing to hang towels on near the tub / shower, which meant we had to go dripping to the opposite side of the large bathroom to dry ourselves. Other than that, all was good. Breakfast on each floor is an innovative way to overcome the space crunch. It could feel like breakfast in bed if your partner brings in the food for you as you lounge around. I did for the husband. Breakfast is the same every day, so be warned, it could get boring. Another distinct advantage - free alcoholic beverages every evening. I loved that we could walk to wherever we wanted - Millennium Park, Navy Pier, Hancock Tower, Sears Tower, and of course, the shopping.


Room Tip: Corner rooms are large, with windows on three sides. Choose one as far away from the nightclub next...

"We recently traveled to Chicago for pleasure. We booked this hotel through Hotwire and really scored BIG! This hotel is in a GREAT location. We felt safe at night walking around the area and it is literally blocks from about everything we wanted to visit. The hotel was updated and clean. The hotel served an amazing breakfast each morning outside our room. They have an array of food available on EVERY floor. There was an abundance of food...from fruit, hard boiled eggs, cereals, doughnuts, pastries, breads and bagels available. They also had free drinks available in the evenings for adults. The hotel staff was incredibly friendly and knowledgeable. They recommended a pizza place to us and then gave us a coupon for a free dessert! Great hotel - we would love to stay here again!!!"

From the front desk staff to the valet staff, everyone was helpful and professional!

"I stayed at the Kinzie last weekend in Chicago. I was on the 6th floor with a wonderful view. And right down the hall from the daily happy hour suite. The room was beautiful and even had a sitting area with a sofa. Continental breakfast is served every morning in the lobby on each floor. So convenient to walk out my door and get breakfast and fresh coffee. The staff was very friendly and helpful. The water in the lobby was delicious...one day it was cucumber water, the next day made with fresh watermelon. I felt like I was at a spa! Almost forgot to mention the bed...heavenly. I will stay here every time I visit Chicago!

This hotel does it smart. Having the continental breakfast on every floor and the nightly manager cocktail hours was something I have not seen before. The employees are incredibly helpful and nice. I was traveling alone and they were able to give me advise on how to get around safely. There was noise at night from the bar across the street and the local traffic. This is expected whenever you're in a downtown type area. The hotel had a wonderful location. Next time I head up to Chicago I plan on staying at Kinzie again.
"My daughter and I stayed in a 6th floor suite. It was very comfortable and amazingly quiet even though the room was situated over a main street. Having just returned from an out of town business trip where I stayed at a different hotel having a room over the main street, it was unbelievably noisy and made sleep difficult at times. Not true of the Kinzie Hotel suite.The Kinzie Hotel is warm and inviting and pleasantly decorated. Bathroom amenities and on-floor buffet breakfast were wonderful.All the employees I met were very nice especially those in reservations, Amanda Travers and Katie Russell. Not often does one have the opportunity to meet the general manager, Patti Koehn or the office manager, Melissa Drza who were equally as welcoming.Great experience overall and looking forward to returning soon."
"I booked this hotel mainly because I got a very good rate for it on another website. Had it not been for the positive reviews, I might have been a little leery because I did not know much about it, but I am so glad I booked it. The staff members were conscientious and friendly. Never once did I feel like I was hassling them with requests, and in the halls and common areas we were always greeted with a smile. The rooms were clean, beds were super comfortable, and we had just enough space for three in a room with a king bed and a pull out sofa. That being said, the best part about this hotel was the free breakfast every morning served by the elevator. I wish more hotels did this, as it was a pleasure waking up every morning and walking a few steps to get fresh coffee, muffins, toast, cereal (plus more) as well as good coffee. There were no attendants standing by or pressure to tip. The hotel trusts the guests to act like adults and not spill stuff all over the place or be wasteful. It was a really nice touch and adds value to the hotel. We didn't get to try the cocktail hour because we were just never around for it, but I wish we had."
"This was our 2nd stay at the Kinzie and now that it's completely remodeled, we had a wonderful experience. The room with a king size bed and a large bathroom was comfortable and quiet. Breakfast was included, with a nice choice of fruits, grains, yogurts, cheeses and beverages. The evening cocktail hour was also a plus, with great wines and appetizers. Katie Russell our hostess was exceptional and offered several ideas for great restaurants. The bellmen were courteous and helpful as we loaded and departed in heavy rain. One unexpected perk: after the repairman fixed the running toilet on the morning of our 2nd day, he left us two large chocolate wrenches...very tasty Charlie! thanks for your great hospitality.

"Just stayed at the Kinzie July 11-13 and it was great. First thing is that it is only a block away from the Blue Line Subway (EL) that comes from O'Hare airport (Clark & Lake exit). Its a 30-40 minute train ride but for $2.50 each its good. The bed was comfortable, room was clean, blinds covered the windows well so it was dark and the noise was next to nil. Slept really well there. All the personnel were exceptionally polite and welcoming. Jose at the front desk was great for giving us ideas where to eat and advising on some attractions. Everything is walking distance in my opinion as we were close to the ""magnificent mile"", Millennium Park, Art Museum and the river where the boat tours start from. They do a appetizer/drink 5-8 up on the 6th floor which was nice as it held you over before you go out for dinner. Complimentary drink and food (cut up veggies, cheese, sliced meats) were a nice treat. The gym is really clean with 1 recumbent bike, couple treadmills, elliptical, and couple weight machines as well as some free weights. Overall I would recommend this hotel and will be going back again for sure."
"Travelled with sixteen ladies from our Bookclub to experience Chicago and it started on the right foot by choosing to stay at this incredible hotel. Location, location, location! Inexpensive cab fare from the train station and we could walk to most tourist sights, close to awesome shopping and dining in safe and beautiful neighbourhood. Clean crisp modern hotel with the most friendly staff, handsome and helpful doormen and all staff said hello first and nothing was too much trouble including the maid service. Breakfast served on each floor so walking out in one of the provided bathrobes to get a coffee and juice was no problem. Hard boiled eggs and lovely chocolate croissants and yogurts and fruits and all types of items to toast. Started the day off right in such a convenient manner. Happy hour each evening with one free drink and appetizers provided, ( I'm talking prosciutto wrapped asparagus not chips and dip) rooms were very clean, smelled good, bathrooms were immaculate and towels smelled fresh, beds were super comfy. Slept well every night even in the middle of a noisy metropolis. We will definitely stay here again! No need to look any where else !


Room Tip: Ask for a room that faces Kinzie and not near the elevator

"This hotel is in a great location. I wanted to see the downtown in night and this hotel was in perfect location even though they don't have rooms in the upper floors. Staff was good and room was super clean. Evening drinks were really nice ;)Only issue I had was - I called the hotel in the morning to check if I can check in early at 11. They said it's ok and can come. When I went there room was not ready and we'd to wait nearly till 3 PM with small kids. I hope they will be more sensible in future.


Room Tip: Stay at upper corner levels for nice city view

"I was traveling to The Langham Chicago (5-star hotel) for business with a group and gave up my room there for one of my clients when we learned that hotel was overbooked. The Kinzie is located just around the corner and the Langham booked me there. At first I thought the Kinzie looked cheap/chintzy online and I was concerned but my Langham contact assured me it had just been refurbished/updated. My room was clean, the furnishings were new, the bed linens were of good quality, and the robes were nice. The long counter ""desk"" made it easy to spread out my work and get a lot done. They set up a breakfast buffet in the elevator foyer area on every floor each morning - coffees, juices, cereals, yogurts, muffins/pastries, toaster w/breads & bagels, whole fruit, string cheese. There's also a lounge on the 6th floor and you're given a coin good for 1 drink for each night of your stay. Due to business commitments I was not able to visit the lounge but I did peek in to check it out and it seemed fairly nice - fun lighting, big screen TV, variety of seating/tables - and it was busy. The cons of The Kinzie are minimal: small closet, I could hear the ppl in the room next to me raising and lowering their shades, could also hear what I assume to be construction noise well into the night even with earplugs.


Room Tip: The lounge is on the 6th floor.

"Very clean, great location and nice free continental breakfast on each floor.Nice optional place for breakfast around the corner at bin61Funny, I left tip money under the pillow for the maid and she did not take it and left in on the table instead.Like all Hotels the parking was expensive $55Good Hotel if you want to keep it simple without paying all the extras like swimming pool ect.I would go back."
"If you're looking for a well-positioned boutique hotel for a short stay in the downtown area of Chicago, then look no further than Kinzie Hotel. Ask for a room on the highest floor possible and in the back if you can handle the darkness with which you might be faced, but that will allow you to avoid the yelling revellers complained of my another review. Some great deals can be had for this property if you know how to use some of the online discount booking services.TL;DR, Kinzie Hotel is comfortable, welcoming and well-run. Recommended."
"From June 28 to July 3, 2014 my mom and I had the pleasure of staying at the Kinzie Hotel. This was truly the best hotel experience we have ever had. Right when we checked in to the hotel late at night, we were greeted by a very friendly and accommodating staff. I had read reviews in advance and knew to ask for a higher floor and away from the bar next door to the hotel, and our room on the 5th floor was waiting for us. It was perfect. It was updated and elegantly decorated. The breakfast by the elevators could not have been better. The evening reception was lovely. Those two events saved us $500. The value was incredible and location couldn't be beat. We walked everywhere and enjoyed accessing the theatre district so easily. A special thank you to Monica and Julian at the front desk who treated us like family. They always had time for our questions and gave great recommendations. They were enthusiastic to hear our reviews of the events they recommended. Thank you to Meg for her shopping tips. The maintenance department was very attentive and gave us chocolate wrenches to thank us for our patience as this newly renovated, fabulous hotel continues to make each room flawless!

"Good hotel. Very good value. Great continental breakfast with very fresh food and nice choices. Managers reception an excellent touch, but it may impact your hunger at dinner.... And with Chicago restaurants being so great, you may not want to spoil your appetite. Better to just have a drink or 2 at the reception and then head out for some fun.This was always my favorite place in Chicago for a clean, comfortable stay at a good value. The only down-side was a lack of a view from any of the rooms. Given the awesome views at other Chicago hotels, I prefer others like Hotel Monaco..."
"This was our first stay since the remodel and it is very nice. Our 9 year old loved having a window to look out along the busy street. Convenient location to many restaurants and shopping sites. Nice free breakfast (only complaint is they didnt replenish as frequently on weekend) and free wifi are great perks. My only negative was housekeeping wanted in our rooms on Saturday and Sunday at 9 AM even with the Do Not Disturb sign on the door. When we returned on Saturday at 4PM, our room still had not been cleaned but they came while we attended the managers reception. I guess when I am vacationing, I would anticipate later cleaning on the weekends."
"From the minute we walked in the door, we felt welcomed. Everyone we came in contact with was awesome. Got a great deal for an overnight trip. Rooms were clean and good sized, bed comfortable. We had a small issue with the toilet when we first arrived and maintenance was there almost immediately. The hotel is located in a great area with restaurants and shops nearby. As others have stated, the breakfast and cocktails included in the stay were terrific and much appreciated. Looking forward to the time we can make a return visit."
"Newly renovated within the last year or so. The room was good sized and nicely appointed, the chair was actually comfortable, the bed was very comfortable. There is a nice desk work area. We came for a long weekend and the hotel has a very good location and the downtown attractions are easily reached. Lots of great restaurants close by, can easily walk to them, and a couple of decent music venues. The staff were all very friendly and helpful, and the concierge staff was great, getting us reservations at 2 great restaurants we could not get into ourselves, and helping us find a few other things we were looking for. We booked through hotwire and got a great rate vs. the standard rate. Add in a free wifi, free continental breakfast, and free drink reception every evening, and I couldnt have asked for more. Would definitely stay again.

"Nice continental breakfast on each floor, complimentary Happy Hour with some munchies, comfortable beds, refrigerator in the room and helpful staff. Easy to get everywhere from here. We fell into this hotel on some internet site but it was super! What else could anyone ask for? One silly complaint- no drawers for unpacking. Bathroom had no countertops to put stuff on. Simply an inconvenience. I would return here."
"The Kinzie Hotel is a new favorite. Kinzie is a boutique hotel of just 6 floors and does not have an on-site restaurant, however, there are so many good restaurants nearby that I didn't miss it. I usually don't give five circles for hotels that aren't in the highest tier (i.e., Hotel Bora Bora, Four Seasons, etc.), but the Kinzie earned them. The service is terrific, the gourmet continental breakfast is top-notch, and the complimentary cocktail hour was both lively and delicious - unexpectedly tasty wine, and unexpectedly delicious hors d' oeuvres. Our room was spotless. Keurigs in every room. Location is excellent, just a 10 minute walk to the Architectural Foundation's boat cruise, about the same to Nordstrom and the magnificent mile. My only ding is that the Kinzie does not provide any gratis bottled water in the rooms, but it's too minor a point to make a deduction in my book; there is a CVS a block or so away, so we stocked up there."
"I got an awesome deal on this hotel that was in the heart of downtown. The hotel staff was very friendly and the rooms were fine. Major spread on every floor for continental breakfast (I hope they donate all the leftovers) and complimentary glass of wine in the 'lounge' in the evening are nice touches.The business center was somewhat lacking and the lobby is small, so if you want to have a meeting at the hotel like I did, think again. (We ended up using the lounge which is unoccupied by day but still not ideal.)"
"We recently stayed three nights at the Kinzie which used to be the Amalfi (good to know when asking for directions). The hotel has recently been remodeled and the rooms are very nice. Bed was comfortable and the double-head shower was a nice touch. The staff were very friendly and knowledgable about the area and there were several very good restaurants close by as well as night clubs. A couple of items to note - the Kinzie is located on Kinzie St. which is a ""low road"" and while the walk from there to Michigan St. is only about four blocks you need to climb a set of stairs. There is probably a route without stairs - you would need to ask. Also, the lighting in the bathroom is a little dim but they do provide a lighted makeup mirror. The breakfast is served by the elevators on each floor which is great! No having to get dressed to go get it - just put on the robe(s) they provide and you're sipping coffee, etc. in no time. We enjoyed our stay at the Kinzie and would definitely stay there again!"
"This was a trip to celebrate an anniversary and the hotel was a great choice.Location was perfect, walkable to and from shops and sights.The room was uber modern in a comfortable way, slept really well and no noise.The staff are trained to be professional but to be nice too takes it to another level. Breakfast on each floor is a great idea if you need to be somewhere.Enjoyed the weekend in Chicago, wonderful stay at the Kinzie."
"We stayed at the Kinzie hotel for 4 nights just prior to Memorial Day. The hotel is in a great central location; walking distance to the SkyDeck, Millennium Park etc. They offer a basic breakfast on every floor in the morning, self serve, grab and go type of foods like cereal, bagels, hard boiled eggs, coffee, tea. They also offer a cocktail event in the evenings. The staff was very accommodating and friendly."
"We stayed here last week while my husband had a meeting at the Merchandise Mart. The location was good for us, close to his meeting, shopping and many dining choices. We had plans for other restaurants already but there are many options in the area. The price was reasonable for the area. The room was clean and bed comfortable. The bathroom toiletries were very nice. It is great to have free wi-fi available. The staff were very nice, always greeting you and providing any information you might need. The breakfast is served out by the elevators so you don't have to go to a dining room. but you then have to eat in your room, that can be good or bad, not sure if I like it. The choices were fine, heavy on bakery and grain items, my husband enjoyed the hard boiled eggs. They had yogurt available. They have a happy hour available which I did check out. They even gave you coins for redeeming alcohol drinks and had a nice assortment of snacks. It was located on the 6th floor in a room with a bar and tables. It was a nice touch but we had other plans. The valet service seemed to take a long time, especially when we were checking out on a Saturday morning. I would look at staying here again due to price and location."
"Upon arrival, we passed the car keys to the valet (daily fee) and did not need see the car the entire weekend. We were in town to visit area Universities, find a prom dress, and meet up with friends. The Kinzie met all the requirements: walkability to ""power shopping"", plenty of delicious restaurants/ bars close by, and clean modern rooms with trendy decor. After comparing several websites, calling the Hotel direct gave the best weekend rate, so do your homework. The breakfast (free) on the run is a light buffet bar on each floor. Items such as yogurt, cereal, and bagels. There is also a Managers reception (free) in the evening which was fun for the adults before a night on the town, as we snacked on light appetizers and drinks. The view from our room was another building, which didn't really matter to us. My teens loved the visit."

More of a lounge atmosphere. great continental breakfast on your room floor. Juices, cereal, fruit, yogurt... Makes it an even better value!! Please check out your parking options, I'd say that was my only concern. Parked 2 blocks away for $26 with Spothero (yes it really works) when valet was $60. I stayed at this hotel when it was The Amalfi, and I think this is even nicer now. Would stay again!"
"Newly renovated so everything is fresh. Valet service was very friendly but they do not automatically put it on your bill so it might be an issue when you check-out. Check-in staff was very friendly but it felt awkward to have to sit down for the quick process. The receptionists are sitting down and it feels like you are applying for a loan at a bank ;). They even gave two tokens for free drinks later! Room was big and felt deluxe. Bedding (mattress, sheets, pillows, blankets) felt like heaven! The room faced an alley so their were lots of Monday early morning sounds like trucks backing up, dumpsters being moved, ambulances, workers. If you have to get up, it won't matter. But if you want to sleep in...it will matter. Bathroom had no fan. The third floor is the only floor with no ice machine. Absolutely wonderful continental breakfast on each & every floor!!!! AWESOME! Check-out staff was not so friendly. Hotel is so perfectly located: Trump Tower, Public House bar, Black Fin Bar was AWESOME, Harry's. 2 minute walk to House of Blues, where the food was out of this world! I would stay again at Kinzie.


Room Tip: Third floor has no ice machine.

"the hotel is fabulous! centrally located in the city, but off the beaten path. Right next to a great pub, and across the street from one of Chicagos legendary restaurants, Harry Careys. Rooms and bathroom newly renovated. Staff is exceptional, and the coctails everynight at 5pm is a great perk! Been staying at this hotel in the city for about 8 years, each time I visit. I have stayed at many others, but this one is two thumbs up!


Room Tip: also has a fitness center.

"This hotel was exactly what we were looking for - a boutique hotel in a great location, with nice amenities and excellent service. We were not disappointed - we had a little snafu with the parking and the staff upgraded us to a beautiful room with windows on two sides, giving us beautiful views of the skyline. The room was contemporary and clean and had everything we needed. The evening reception and breakfast in the morning make this an incredible value. Friendly and helpful staff. We definitely will stay here again - so happy we found this!"
"Just got back (3-28-14) from a one night stay at the Kinzie with my wife and 6-yr old. PROS: This hotel had its grand opening (used to be the Amalfi now the Kinzie) one week before we arrived and is newly remodeled. The rooms are very nice, contemporary styling just as you see in their photos. Everything was very clean and well appointed. Bathroom was very good. The service staff was courteous and helpful...can't speak for the desk people because I had little to do with them actually. The breakfast was a good quality, true continental breakfast (nothing hot such as waffles, oatmeal, scrambled eggs, etc.) but a nice selection of pastries, some fruit, cold cereal, coffee, juice, muffins, yogurt, etc. The room was quiet and we had no disturbances. I would say this is a fine hotel for the business traveler, single person or perhaps couples who just need a nice place to stay before heading out to see the sights, etc. It is in a pretty decent location close to the heart of the city, Michigan Ave and all that. An easy walk of a few blocks. CONS: For families or someone who likes to ""use"" the hotel to relax you can do better. No pool, which we understood, no complaints just so you understand. We did not like that there was no place to relax with a newspaper of a cup of coffee for example. They do not have a typical hotel lobby with comfy chairs/sofas where you can watch TV, read the paper with a cup of coffee while watching a game or whatever. Also they do not have an eating area. Each floor has it's on breakfast area outside the elevator, which is okay, but then you have to take the stuff back to your room or find someplace else to set up for breakfast. We found that to be a nuisance and took the leisure and enjoyment out of the breakfast time. Plus we have to leave our dirty dishes in the room because there was no place to put them at the food service area. I would highly recommend they find a comfortable accommodating place for people on each floor to enjoy their breakfast...it is very much an ""on the run"" feel to it. Finally, although the beds were comfortable enough the pillows in our room were very uncomfortable. The kind that are very firm and keep your neck crooked all night. Fortunately they had about eight pillows so I found one that worked well enough. If you bring your own pillows better for you or perhaps they will provide something else if you ask them. Overall a very nice hotel for the on the go person but not the best choice for anyone who wants to enjoy a hotel as part of their experience beyond sleeping in a nice clean room...which they were.


Room Tip: We had an ""inside room"" which overlooked a flat roof/vents etc. to an adjoining building...

This hotel is amazing love love love. We did have a problem with our room being close to the night club so the first night all we heard was techno beats till four in the morning. We went to the staff the next morning and told them of our dilemma. Julian was amazing we received a different room on a quieter floor and they even brought all our stuff to our new room. Then are key wasn't working and he came right back upstairs to help us. I have stayed in dozens of hotels all over the city of Chicago and this one is at the top of my list. The breakfast and the cocktail hour are awesome also thank you so much. Great place
"Stayed at the Kinzie Hotel in River North District of Chicago. Had all the things which are important to me including reasonable price, very clean, and comfortable bed. However, this hotel exceeded my expectations with its lovely furnishings, delicious breakfast spread and all in a perfect location. The entire hotel staff seemed dedicated to making the stay a great experience. I especially want to give a big thank you to Meg.Reserved my parking space through Spothero.com which is a brilliant website/concept. Parked at the garage at 540 N State street for $26/night which was just couple blocks from hotel. Highly recommend this company.Look forward to my next stay at the Kinzie Hotel."
"Celebrated our 24th anniversary in downtown chicago. Hotel was clean and newly remodeled.We were upgraded to a corner room that was very nice. Font line was nice, front desk even nicer. Gave recommendation for close Sushi. Went to Friends Sushi (excellent). Close to House of blues, Michigan Ave, restaurants and shopping. Clean, friendly and affordable. We always stay out at airport for better prices and drive in everyday. Parking is free at airport. Our great stay may change our mind.

Artwork I would love to have in my home, incredible bedding, awesome street map wallpaper, keurig, double shower head, spacious rooms. Service and all staff were unbelievably gracious and helpful. Awesome doorman held the door, pulled out my chair at the check in desk, and helped call taxis and gave wonderful directions. Magan checked us in and was so thorough and kind. We were offered water, given early check in, and Magan went out of her way to help us with maps and suggestions. Every single person who works there is pleasant, helpful and essentially a concierge service! Bellman, housekeeping, bartender at happy hour, ... Every one greeted us with smiles and helped in so many ways. The cocktail hour and breakfast on each floor are incredible perks. We travel very frequently for work and pleasure, and this is by far the best overall experience I've ever had with a hotel!"
"I stayed at the Kinzie hotel last weekend while on a girls trip to Chicago. From the moment we brought our bags into the lobby til we checked out three days later...everything was perfect. Our room had two queens and was spacious enough for 4. The beds were comfy and we really enjoyed the big window overlooking the city. Bed linens were awesome, room wasn't too hot or too cold during the night. Breakfast was included and it was served on each floor. So, in the morning before starting our day, we found free coffee, muffins/pastries, string cheese, cereal and yogurt by the elevator and were able to take this back to our room. In the evening, we likewise enjoyed the free drinks and great appetizers before going to out dinner. Super staff...highly recommend with hotel. Close to shopping and resturants."
"Booked a king suite for three people -- a really excellent way to enjoy some time away with family while having separate spaces. And the space you get! Very modern and elegant, impeccably clean, and entirely comfortable for a very affordable price. We came on a discounted rate, but I think we would have paid the difference. The service was really that good. We came looking for a relaxing weekend that would leave us refreshed, and we got it.The happy hour is indeed a happy time -- good spread of food, good drinks. The breakfast is your average continental, though I will say they get a big shout out for serving hard-boiled eggs that were perfectly cooked! It's always a gamble when they're served, and they did not disappoint.The windows on the suite gave us a great view...except when we got flashed by guests from the Marriott next door. Luckily, the blinds for the room come down quickly with just the push of a button! Very fancy. If we're not airbnb-ing in Chicago, we will definitely stay here again."
"I can't imagine a better birthday spent in the downtown River North area of Chicago. Katie and Haley at the Front Desk went above and beyond to make sure my evening was nothing but the best. They sent me complimentary birthday champagne and chocolate covered strawberries. They set me up in one of their brand new guestroom suites which was unbelievable. We were also given complimentary drink tickets to use at the bar on the 6th floor to begin our night out.Katie set up a great evening for us - dinner and drinks at Untitled. This lounge/restaurant is just a few blocks from the hotel. They had a table reserved for myself and a large group of friends right in front of the live music in the dining room. There were also 2 burlesque shows in between the band breaks and I was serenaded by the burlesque dancer making the experience even more exciting! She also reserved us a table followed by dinner at The Grid - another lounge close in the area. Great music, great friends, and great experience all in all!I highly recommend this hotel whether it be visiting or just a fun night out downtown! A personalized and wonderful stay - very rare to find and one of a kind!

"Excellent location. It is within short walking distance of everything. There are plenty of 5 star restaurants, bar & grills, pubs etc. right on the corner. Just a couple blocks from Michigan Ave. and the ""Magnificent Mile"" shopping. If you are looking for a hotel that is in a great spot, this is definitely the place. A couple servers asked where we were staying when we dined out. When we told them The Kinzie they both said ""very nice place"" and ""very convenient and close to everything"". The rooms are very comfortable. Our room on the 5th floor was recently remodeled. Very comfortable bed. Everything was new and ultra clean. The pictures of the rooms on their website are accurate. The complimentary breakfast is located on each floor and was adequate. There is no seating for breakfast so you have to take back to your room. Not that big of a deal. The only surprise was the $56.00 overnight parking fee. Having said that, because of how convenient this location is, it is not too bad because it cost $4.00 an hour to park on the street at a meter...if you can even find a spot! We were able to check out of the room in the morning and go eat, shop and walk without moving the car. You can keep your vehicle in the parking facility until 6:00p of your checkout day. Also, you have in/out privileges at no additional charge should you need to drive somewhere further out. Overall, our stay was excellent. No complaints. We will definitely repeat."
"From the warm welcome, the comfy and stylish rooms and the free cocktail hour. The Kinzie lives up to its promises. Stayed here before when it was the Amalfi - liked it then too! I would recommend this hotel and am grateful for its warmth in a still very icy early spring.

"The hotel is very well located in central Chicago, no far from the river. The room I had at the very end of the aisle on the second floor was quite big and the bed very comfortable. Cleanliness was beyond reproach; a constant noise, however, was to be heard in the room and it was disturbing when trynign to get asleep. The personel was apologetic about it, but did not solve the problem. Free ""after hours"" drinks were offered. The breakfast served on each floor is by far not up to the hotel standard, somewhat impractical also because you have to take your food and coffee to your room, or stay in the corridor.

"This was my first trip to Chicago and an incredible stay at the Intercontinental. The architecture of the city is amazing and the historic nature of this hotel does not disappoint. If you appreciate historic architecture and interiors, don't miss the pool. It is beautiful even if you don't want to swim. The rooms are modern and very clean. I was also lucky enough to see the newly renovated presidential suite, which was amazing. The wedding I attended was held in the King Arthur court and Hall of Lions, both majestic. The service was cordial, professional and fast. I had an issue with my key and couldn't enter my room, called the front desk from the phone at the end of the hall on my floor and within minutes security was there to help me out (after verifying my identity). The Starbucks in the lobby was an added bonus as well. The only thing that I have to question is the minibar and the pay per item display on the countetop would have been an issue if my kids came with me. It seems to be excessive to offer items at such high prices and even charge a fee to have it emptied. There is a liquor store and even a wholefoods a block away. Wifi was fast and reliable, (free for IHG members), but it cut off after my first night stay and I couldn't figure out how to reconnect. Since I was at the wedding, I didn't have time to talk to tech support as suggested to have them troubleshoot."
"We booked a bed & breakfast package which was well worth it. The hotel building itself is fantastic. The location is center of Magnificent Mile where filled with shops and restaurants and a short walk to Cloud Gate (The Bean), Chicago 360 Observatory, and.etc. The room is nice with comfortable beds. Gym and a big swimming pool are located on 12th floor. The Grand Buffet is terrific with abundant choices and good quality food, drinks, and fruits served until noon on weekend which is very thoughtful. We didn't have to rush up for the breakfast and we even didn't need to have lunch after the big hearty breakfast.Tips: Join the free IHG member to get free in-room wifi. Trivias: in-room safe box; no in-room coffee/tea maker; Grand buffet 29.-; no Jacuzzi or hot tubs."
"I have stayed at this hotel a number of times over the years for business and pleasure. The staff is great. The physical property, though is badly in need of restoration. The lobby has become gaudy and full of advertising. The rooms, which were ""updated"" some years ago seem tired and worn and need another refurbishment. I generally like Intercontinental properties. Their European hotels seem to be far better than the US ones, however."
"Beautiful hotel with a grand staircase and a fairly small lobby compared to some of the larger hotels in the area, but comparable with other hotels located directly on Michigan Avenue's Magnificent Mile. They offered a Starbucks coupon at check in and the Starbucks was conveniently located right off the lobby. The room was a standard Intercontinental room and looked much better than the one on the electronic monitor at the desk. Comfortable and large bed. Very cute decor- a cross between chic and sophisticated. The bathroom had a little wear and tear. For example stains in the tub, chipping paint in the corners, slightly peeling wall paper. Probably not as bad as it sounds, but it could definitely use a little attention to the fine details. Needed a little botox versus a full face lift. The rest of room was very well kept though. Even the pillows on the couch were still fluffy. I could feel a draft from the window and could hear sounds from the street below and I was on the 19th floor. That's some serious city living. Overall service at the hotel was positive. However, I did not have quite a positive experience with room service. The person on the phone seemed to have never heard of condiments such as aioli and balsamic dressing. After she said I don't know (vs let me find out) 3 times I decided to call the ""at your service"" number for help. A very pleasant operator took my order and said she would pass it on to the food and beverage manager. He called me 20 minutes later and had not placed the order yet. So, the short version is it took almost 2 hours to get a burger and salad. The burger was well seasoned and tasty, but I hate to even say it, but it was barely warm when it arrived. Nonetheless, I ate it and was thankful that it arrived. Due to the 2 hour inconvenience, the burger was comped. Which I did not ask for but appreciated. I was not feeling well one evening and called looking for the location of the water machine. There was a $7 mini bottle of Evian in the room-which I drank on the first day in desperation because it was too late to go out and a $12 bottle I wouldn't dare touch on principle. Much to my surprise a hotel employee (Suada) showed up at my door with a pretty large size bottle of water. She could tell I wasn't feeling well when she came to bring my turndown chocolate. Luckily there is a Whole Foods a couple of blocks away and a Walgreens across the street so I didn't have to be thirsty again. My flight was canceled and the hotel offered me an additional night at the same rate. So, overall I had a pretty positive customer service experience. Would rate good vs very good if that was an option on TripAdvisor"
"The Intercontinental Hotel is located on the 'Magnificent Mile' in downtown Chicago. I spent four nights there while attending a conference. This is a core shopping area in Chicago, which is a very big city. There are lots of other high end hotels within a few minutes, all sorts of stores, restaurants, various cultural sites, etc. I even found a Whole Foods grocery store about five minutes away. There are several museums near by.Checkin was a little slow - there were three people at the front desk but a substantial number of people waiting to check in.There is an adjacent Starbucks, a high end steakhouse (Michael Jordan), a wine bar, and a restaurant on the second floor. I used the Starbucks a few times but ate elsewhere. Hotel restaurants are usually more expensive.My room, on the 26th floor, was fine, with a single bed and a sofa. The bed was comfortable.There were lots of plugins for electronic devices, a desk, etc. The climate control was good, and did not need to be adjusted while I was there. The ventilation was unobtrusive.The bathroom was not cramped, except that there was little space around the sink to put toiletries, etc. The bathroom was perhaps a little dated, but there were no major issues. Water pressure in the sink was not strong, but the water was hot. The shower controls were straightforward and functional.The carpet pattern in the hallway on my floor (and others I assume) was a little weird; when I first looked I thought the carpet was worn or frayed, but it was just the pattern.There was a fair amount of street noise, right until late in the evening. This is hardly surprising given that N. Michigan Avenue is a very busy street.The hotel room's wireless worked well, but there was a $14.95 charge for 24 hours of use. This is the first time in five years that I have had to pay for in-room wireless service. I am not a member of their loyalty program so perhaps that was part the reason but in any event it seemed to be a peculiar limitation in this day and age. So I'm deducting one star for that."
"Stayed here three nights for a conference.The good: location, location, location. Great spot on Michigan Avenue, close to the river and the loop. Starbucks downstairs and Whole Foods two blocks away! The okay: room was fine, slightly tight and crowded. Bed sloped to one side.The bad: - Air conditioner was seriously noisy even on low. The only way to make it better was to turn it off. - Room was not clean enough. Dust buildup in corners. I could see a pen and spare change in between the bed and nightstand along with the dust.- For the three days that I came and went, going past the front desk, I was not once asked how my stay was going or even got a hello."
"Nothing but regret since choosing this location. There is a charge for almost everything. Wifi $18, Gym $12, Bottled water and peanuts in your room $10 (if you remove the items for longer than 30 seconds) and you will ask yourself one question once you arrive here, was the money you spent worth the value you thought you were going to receive? No. This is night one of our stay here and I have complete buyers remorse!"
"We went to Chicago for a quick get-away to celebrate our anniversary. The Intercontinental was not our first choice - the hotel we've used in the past has changed ownership. As a side note, IHG Reservations was very helpful in resolving the issues I had making the reservation. Now back to the hotel. Firstly, this is a big hotel and the prices are about what you'd expect from a property located in absolutely ""prime real estate"" in Chicago. However, check in, even at 10:45 AM, was friendly and efficient. I was informed our room was unfortunately.not ready, but we were directed to the bell stand to check our luggage and that I would receive a text message when it was ready. (Note: I never did receive a text.) The elevators are initially confusing - one set serves half the floors & the other set serves the rest. Fortunately, during high usage times there is a person standing by to assist guests find the right elevator bank to use. The room was spacious and clean. The bed was comfortable and the pillows were to our liking. The room had darkening shades which worked very well. Overall, the room was nicely appointed and comfortable. The hotel was hosting at least one large conference but the halls were quiet, and housekeeping was efficient. Hotel staff - front desk, bell, restaurant, concierge - were all courteous, efficient, knowledgable, and friendly. The hotel's location is excellent - close to restaurants, shopping, and an easy cab ride to all museums. Would I stay here again? Yes, but if all you want is clean and safe, there are other hotels in Chicago, although not as conveniently located."
"There is nothing to recommend this hotel. Fair rooms, amenities and the lobby/bar is an absolute zoo at night. You can easily do better for the money. Fit and finish-bathroom, sheets, towels, etc were middle brow at best. 500 Michigan Ave location is convenient to to the Loop business district but somehow the Intercontinental manages to be on a block without nice restaurants of shopping (there is a Mens Wearhouse across the street).

"This is a historical marvel, with it's really quite beautiful. Centrally located on Michigen Avenue, just a few blocks from Navy Pier, the water taxi stand, and the 360 Chicago (formerly known as the John Hancock Observatory). The rooms are nicely appointed, CLEAN, the beds are heaven, and the pool is a site to behold. Stayed one night with my daughter for a Spring Break Staycation. We did order room service for dinner, and the delivery was smooth, our food presented, and tip included in the charges (so much nicer than awkwardly handing over cash). Great sized portions, we just split it so we wouldn't waste/have leftovers. Comes from Michael Jordan's downstairs and it is very good.We ordered an in-room movie and were dismayed to find that when we had to leave with 1/2 the movie leftover, it was irretrievable without purchasing twice. This wasn't made clear with purchase, really. There was a confusing blurb about the subject, but we read it to mean it was available for 24 hours from purchase. Apparently it's available for ONE viewing per 24 hours. Ridiculous in my opinion for such a high-caliber hotel.Complimentary WiFi with IHG membership. Fast and readily available. Check in and concierge wonderful. Everyone is very very polite and helpful, without being intrusive. Umbrellas are available for rain, which I thought was a wonderful touch. We were always assisted in hailing cabs.Probably won't be back only because with that kind of cost, it's not really practical. There are equally well-placed hotels with more amenities. The showers in the ""spa/health club"" were being worked on so there was construction debris everywhere & there is only one small hot sauna room available. They should really expand the ""health club"" to be an ACTUAL full-service spa and then it would really be worth the hyped up price. Overall, worth a stay to enjoy the pool at least once- especially when it's cold and dreary outside."
"The title says it all! This was a great hotel in of the most perfect spots of the Magnificent Mile. I was able to take the Blue Line to the Red Line from the airport for a total cost of $5.00. I felt as though I was a Chicagoan and was only a little more than a block away from the hotel. I was able to walk through the mall and there was the Intercontinental Hotel. It is very close to the river, walk down the opposite direction and you have shopping for days. You have everything from Saks Fifth Avenue, Banana Republic, Cheesecake Factory, Nike town and many other stores you can enjoy. I enjoyed walking at night and felt very comfortable. The Chicago police officers were out in the streets so didn't have a fear at all. Also was able to find the Lamborghini and Rolls Royce shop so I was doing some major window shopping. I would recommend this hotel for the cool rooms with comfortable beds. I will include some photos from the room and the top floors for you to see. Enjoy."
"The Intercontinental in Chicago is an expensive hotel with lots of meeting space. The staff is about average-not rude, not particulary pleasant or welcoming. There is no lobby, which is annoying since there are many meetings in session at the same time and no place to sit down or network. Even though I hadn't requested it, I got an handicapped room that was very large-too large to see the TV from the bed. The room was spartan or minimalist and completely devoid of warmth. The handicapped walk-in shower seemed like a good idea until there was actually water running in and then regardless of how careful I was, water, got all over the bathroom floor. Using the water-saving toilet was also problematic-not once did the paper do down with the flush. There were several lamps in the room but since it was so large, it was difficult to see most of the room. The food sources in the hotel were not impressive-a steakhouse and a dirty overcrowded Starbucks. In general I found the hotel to be uncomfortable and not anyplace I wanted to do anything in beside sleep-if there had been another alternative, I would have switched hotels.My room was over $400/night, a price I would never pay for this hotel again. Definitely not worth the price. The location was great and it was easy to walk anywhere. In summary, this hotel is not nearly as nice as it thinks it is.


Green Features: Good practices, but not very workable. Also, replaced all towels even though they were not on the floor or in the tub. Did that for 3 days."
"I traveled in April 2015 to attend a conference and shared a room in the hotel's newer section with a friend. We both agreed that we would not choose this hotel again when so many other, more spacious options are available in the same area. We had a room on the 25th floor of the new tower with a view into the windows of a neighboring apartment building. We might have been able to tolerate the view had the room itself not been so small and awkwardly laid out. You could not move the desk chair back far enough to sit down without bumping into the bed, nor could you open the small dresser drawers easily because they were hidden behind a cabinet door that blocked passage between the bed and dresser. The bathroom had no shelves, and the small entranceway to the room had a lowered ceiling and was so dimly lit that it was difficult to see the contents of the small closed carved into the wall right next to the entrance. This was not a budget option, even with conference rates, yet the size and layout of the room made it feel like one. Yes, the location is very good, but with so many other large chain hotels right nearby there is no reason to pay a premium for such a mediocre room. A big draw when we made the reservation was the pool, but it's possible to get a day pass for that and have a more comfortable stay elsewhere at a lower rate. Wish I had stayed at the Embassy Suites as I did on my last trip to Chi-town.

"I arrived at 7 PM, and there was a short line for check-in. It was quickly apparent that each guest took a long time. As an IHG member, I expected a quick check-in; not a chance. Each time I re-visited the desk, there was a long line.The bed was worn out at the edges. I was alone, so I could sleep in the middle, but that's inconvenient. The HVAC system was noisy; even if I turned the fan speed to ""low."" Made it hard to get to sleep. The minibar was outrageous ($9.90 for a beer), and was the type where if you remove something, you bought it. They were kind enough to leave room for four cans of pop for guest use. I prefer either just a fridge, or a minibar where you can remove everything and put it aside, replacing it when you leave. The TV check-out did not work, and there was (another) long line. I dropped my key in the box with a note (Line too long; out of 950 at 10:35 AM). Eventually, after asking twice by email, I received a receipt. Not a hotel I would choose to return to. I prefer a Residence Inn or Embassy Suites, with free breakfast, free wifi, free evening reception, and a fridge and microwave (or full kitchen at Residence Inn). Maybe I'm just not cut out for an old-style hotel.


Green Features: Like most hotels, hanging my towel up did not avoid laundering. The HVAC system needs to be upgraded both to reduce noise and to enable a lower energy-saving fan speed."
I was in Chicago for the HIMSS Conference and stayed at the Intercontinental on Michigan. My room was very nice - clean and nicely decorated. I think they need to update a bit and remove the room snacks. Does anybody really buy the $7.50 can of Coke? This would open the fridge for the guest to use. The staff was very friendly and helpful. The restaurant suggestions from the concierge were excellent each night. There are numerous places to eat close by. I thought the restaurant for breakfast was very expensive at $25/person. The hotel is in a great location.
"This is renewed hotel where what matters the most is the location.Really close to all Chicago's must see and must do's. We only needed to take a taxi going from and to the airport, everywhere else we went walking.Nice small room, we were in the last floor and the water pressure was not good. The A/C was too loud so we turned it off, Chicago's weather it's better now so we could do that.Helpful staff but nothing exceptional.There is a Starbucks in the lobby but is crowded at morning and late afternoon. Just crossing Michigan Avenue there's a Walgreens where you can buy anything you need.The Michael Jordan restaurant is in the lobby too but there are so many really good restaurants in the area that we didn't go.Everything is good in this hotel, but the location is absolutely great!! Super recommended for short or long stays in Chicago."
"Hotel is nothing special. We expected a nice hotel in The InterContinental brand. Our room was fairly large but sparsely appointed. The bathroom had no counter space and very poor lighting. Lobby was cozy and the staff very friendly. Elevators were quick, never had to wait. We'd stay here again if the rate was a great deal but we wouldn't pay a premium rate. It's in a great location on Michigan Ave with great shopping and restaurants."
"We stayed here in March, mixing a business trip with a visit to the city.Hotel service was very good, staff efficient and helpful.We had a lovely room on 34th floor, great views.The location is perfect for seeing the city by bus, water or on foot.Breakfast was the usual hotel buffet but good selection of well prepared food.Had to pay for wifi and the fitness centre, although the pool was free.

"We enjoy staying at the Intercontinental Hotel - Chicago. Rooms are of better than average size, very clean, and comfortable. The location on Michigan Ave. is ideal for travel as this puts you in the heart of the downtown area. Eno - the wine bar - is excellent with the bartender very knowledgeable in a wide variety of wines from around the world.The cocktail bar is always crowded and noisy. Cocktail choice and their preparation needs improvement. Ingredients need to be measured for consistency.We tend not to eat in the restaurant so cannot comment - too many other from which restaurants to choose.Will stay there again."
"I have stayed in this hotel several times, the most recent being in December of 2014. My only complaint is that the front desk is usually overwhelmed with the check in process. We arrived after noon and had to leave our bags due to the room not being ready. When we returned at 5 pm, there was a huge line to check in and an even longer wait for our bags. Those are the negatives. The hotel is a beautiful hotel . The pool is an absolute must see! It is worth going to take a look. Our room was nicely furnished and clean. I have always been happy with the rooms we have had. The elevators are quick and the location is wonderful for the Chicago sights. I like that it is situated between the North Michigan Avenue shopping and still not that far from the State Street shopping and Theater district. However, we like to walk! The bell staff and concierge are always very helpful. There is a Starbucks, a Walgreens and even a McDonald's very close. Other very nice restaurants are plentiful. I usually use a third party booking company and am never disappointed if we stay at the Intercontinental."
"The Hotel Intercontinental is a perfect location for exploring this vibrant city. Everything you could want is right outside the door.

"Service is really non-existent. Staff couldn't be less interested in your experience. They have a ""yeah, whatever"" attitude to you being there. Everything is insanely overpriced. (Example, a bottle of water in the room is $13. Yes, water.) You have no hope of using the fridge in your room (there is a 7""x7"" space you can use. Removing anything from the fridge, whether you use it or not, results in you automatically being charged for the item - all in-room items are tagged, presumably by RFID). In short, avoid this hotel if possible. The Hard Rock Hotel is a couple doors down, and will treat you much better for much less than the $200/night I spent here."
"Located on Michigan Ave in walking distance to the entire core of downtown Chicago. Close to many resturant, bar shopping and site seeing options. Kind staff and bell men. Also, offer lock-up of your bags which was very helpful and allowed for a fun day in the City without dragging around bags. The water tower building which has a great Macy's. The signature room on the 96th floor of the Willis tower."
"This IC has a fantastic location in the heart of the action on North Michigan in downtown Chicago and is a good value for such a great location. Service was up to IC standards, but the newly renovated room in the ""historic"" wing--while certainly clean and comfortable--lacked some amenities that would be expected (table, desk phone, etc.). In short, it was pretty basic for an IC. That said, if you're looking for a good value luxury hotel on North Michigan, this could be it."
"My wife and I stayed here for one night and absolutely loved it. With Ambassador status (which costs $200 a year and good at any Intercontinental, so it's worthwhile if you visit the chain enough), we were upgraded from the cheapest room to a very nice room in the historic tower. The room we were in was a little outdated, but in an strangely good way. It felt like you were in the office of a powerbroker from yesteryear. The color scheme consisted of varying shades of tobacco, and everything had a very executive feel to it. This usually isn't my taste, but for this historic hotel built at the pinnacle of the industrial age, it fits perfectly.The location is absolutely perfect: right on Michigan Avenue and next to the river. Fun fact: this is the only hotel that you can enter directly from Michigan Avenue without having to detour through a side-street. The service was also perfect. I usually couldn't care less about how friendly the check-in person is, but the woman at the front desk was so pleasant that it actually left a memory that I'll always associate with this hotel.The hotel's grounds have two areas that are the highlight of the property and capture this era perfectly. However, my only complaint is that both are hidden. They verbally inform you of these areas at check-in, but both are tucked-away without any helpful signage, and you get the sense that you're trespassing when you are actually checking these sites. It's a shame that they don't have a better way of reassuring you ""no seriously, you're allowed to be here"".The first must-see common area is the Gatsby-esque pool that is included as part of the fitness center, which makes accessing it awkward unless you plan on working out. If you're not exercising, you can still walk through the gym in your street clothes to check out the pool area, which is humid and more photogenic than it looks in-person, but still worth the trip in my opinion.The other common area is the hallways from the old Athletic Club. However, in order to access them from the beginning, you have to cut through the restaurant area and go up an unmarked staircase. We had to ask a random staff member to show us the way, as there is no other guidance. The hallways are beautiful and would be a perfect spot for a bar. Even better, if there was a bar, there would be signs to point people towards it.

"We recently stayed at this hotel for this first time for an overnight trip with friends the weekend of 3/7. The stay started out very well. Valet was courteous and prompt when we arrived and when checking in we were told we had been upgraded to a junior suite for no extra charge. The room was beautiful with a living area and bedroom with a king size bed overlooking Michigan Avenue. Now for the negatives. We enjoyed drinks with the two other couples traveling with us in the hotel bar and paid our portion of the tab by debit card. The bill was split with our friends who paid cash and we paid the remainder. Upon getting home, we had an extra charge for $120 on our bank statement as well as the full bar tab of $175. Thankfully my husband still had the receipt showing what we paid. When he called the hotel on Tuesday, he was told there was a ""server issue"" and the charges would be corrected (still not sure what the $120 was for??). It is now Thursday and these charges still have not been corrected so he will be calling back again.My other issue was with valet going home. This hotel does not bring the car to you when you check out, you must go to the ground floor into a weird parking garage and pick up your car. After having to hand over his drivers license and valet ticket through a window like at the DMV, my husband waited and waited for the car to arrive. We watched 4 different cars come and go before someone asked us what kind of car we drove. It was very strange and was not at all what I would have expected for a hotel like this. For $67 a night in parking, I would have hoped for better service.While the location was good and the room was nice, I would not stay here again and I would hesitate to recommend this hotel. I don't appreciate sketchy charges to my bank account (especially ones that have not been corrected yet) and the valet parking garage was just weird and made me uncomfortable. The service was definitely lacking there."
"I stayed at the hotel for 1 night for business, my first time staying here. The location was excellent. I loved being able to walk to shopping and Millennium Park easily. The service was excellent as well. I appreciated complimentary wifi as an IHG member. The room was very nice. It was perfectly clean, which is always my priority. The room may be small with more than two people. It was perfect for me. I would be very happy to stay here again, for work or for pleasure."
"I was excited to find a great rate (parking included) for a hotel right on the Magnificent Mile. The doorman was very nice and helpful, we got into Chicago early, so we checked our bags and front desk would notify us when our room was available. It wasn't even 30 minutes later that a room was ready (it was only 10:30ish!!) We were placed in the newer tower, the room was nice and clean, beds are a bit hard. But that's my opinion. Loved the indoor pool, very beautiful. My daughter and friend swam while we enjoyed the wine bar located in the hotel. Starbucks in the lobby was excellent, tends to get very busy tho. My only complaint was our ""neighbors"" right across the hall and next door. Mixing up drinks and being loud. They left, and I definitely heard them come back at 2am. Very inconsiderate. Other than that, I will definitely be looking to stay here next visit."
"Wow, I was in town for a baby shower and this was my first time staying at this hotel. (I always stayed at another hotel) From check in to check out, the whole staff was wonderful and very helpful. I felt like a queen. Even the gentlemen that got me a cab was super nice. The room was beautifully done and nice size and very clean. Great views also. I will be staying at this hotel in the future!!!"
"The hotel is located just on the magnificent mile. Everything is close by. I am a platinum member with IHG and I was offered a room upgrade, overlooking the Magnificent mile. The room was quite big, but based on the schematics it was actually the largest on the floor, almost double the size to all the rest. I will totally recommend the hotel. Parking is a bit pricey, since it is downtown chicago. It was around 60USD if I am not mistaken. On the ground floor you will find a Starbucks and Jordan's steakhouse."
"The past few years, we haven chosen the Intercontinental on Michigan Ave for our annual trek to Chicago to enjoy the Christmas trees, lights and holiday shopping. We love this hotel; the location can't be beat and the staff always extremely helpful. The lobby bar is always bustling and beautifully decorated for the holiday season. Thank you Erica, our fab server and Kinga, guest relations supervisor who helped us with our Ambassador Club upgrade. Can't wait to return to Chicago and this fab hotel where we are always warmly welcomed!"
"First - if you want to stay downtown Chicago, this was a great place. Right on Michigan ave. The service at the hotel is perfect. The only gripe I had was that the rooms were a bit small (which I realize given the location real estate is at a premium). The condition of the rooms were above average, but I would have expected them to be pristine. Overall - I would return here. But I'd be curious what the same amount of money per night would get me in that area.


Room Tip: Make sure your room does NOT have an adjoining room - those doors do NOT keep out the noise.

"Didn't overly enjoy the reception I got on checking in, but after that everything was great, concierge was really helpful, as was Teresa down in the fitness centre, she really went above and beyond, recommending places to go and shop. The pool here is amazing, and was one of the stand out features. It is really authentic as it has been there since the 1920's, and it was a great way to start the day before going off to explore the city. We did not have breakfast in the hotel, the Michael Jordan restaurant was quite expensive considering there are other places nearby with similar menu's and at better prices, great little breakfast place too just across the road if you want something more than the Starbucks in the lobby(which was also a great treat to have to blow off the cobwebs in the morning). Hotel is located at the start of the magnificent mile so ideal for shopping, and within an easy walk of the John Hancock building which I think offers the same kind of views as the sky walk, great tip, we were told to get off the elevator at the restaurant as it is free then and the view is the same, than going to the next floor at the top. We did this and had an amazing brunch there, so I think it was money better spent, a must do when in Chicago!. Overall a great visit."
"Perfectly located along Chicago iconic Magnificent Mile, the hotel offers nice and comfortable rooms. Ideal to discover the city, surrounded by great shopping avenues and good restaurants.Try the Michael Jordan steak house, a must go serving excellent meat with a superb wine list. Perfect for a business or family diner.If you like swimming, the pool set in a beautiful Art Deco setting is certainly one of the best in town, a must try !The hotel staff is friendly and very helpful."
"I was able to book a few weekday nights at intercontinental hotel using hotwire. I got a 175 room for 79 per night. Hotel is located in River North and on the Mag Mile. I had to stay there as work was done on my condo. Room was nice, staff was friendly and Michael Jordan steakhouse is attached. It is expensive as all hotels located here but I liked the health club (small pool, treadmills ) and location. Many restaurants around, breakfast buffet for $30 in hotel."
"I just stayed here for 3 nights while in town for work. It's a very dependable hotel. My usual downside with them, however, is that they do not have a hot tub in the pool area. They do have an olympic size swimming pool that has a storied history- it's interesting to see.I really lucked out this visit- I got a room on the 4th floor, which initally I was disappointed with. However, I still had a view of Michigan Avenue and- the best part- I didn't see a single person or hear another single sound from any other place on my floor!!! What a treat that was. I did have a problem with my visit this time, when I took some leftovers to the front desk to put in their refridgerator. They absolutley refused and said they could send up a mini-fridge for $25 if I'd like. I did argue with her, since I have NEVER heard this before from ANY hotel- and I stay at a lot of hotels, but to no avail. Otherwise it was a fine visit."
"I stayed here because I got an excellent rate and as a Platinum Ambassador, I was able to check in early and was upgraded to a newly renovated suite. Bed was comfortable, hotel is quiet, and facilities are excellent. Location is about as good as it gets. For me, it is more or less next door to where I had business meetings, so that was a key decision making factor.The valet dropoff was easy enough, but pickup is less obvious because one has to go down to the garage, but it didn't detract from the overall experience. This will be my hotel of choice in Chicago from now on."
"In lieu of presents for our grandchildren on Christmas and birthdays, we take them for an overnight somewhere. We took two of our older grandkids, Jake and Maddie, 17 and 12 respectively, to Chicago over Martin Luther King Jr. holiday. One of the requirements of a hotel is a swimming pool. The Intercontinental Hotel's pool was a highlight but not as significant as the kids' first impression of hotel's lobby area. They were blown away. They especially like the giant video screen behind the reception desk. Starbucks was a hit as well. Our suite was the extreme whipped cream on the sundae! They absolutely loved it. We arrived on Sunday and checked out on Monday. We dropped our bags off and went out for the afternoon. When we came back, the kids swam. The decision was made to have dinner in our suite via room service. When reviewing the time we spent, Maddie reported the time we spent eating and hanging out in the room was her favorite.We were allowed a late check out which made it possible to do activities on Sunday, collect our things, check out and make the train.We would recommend the Intercontinental and plan to stay their again on another grandkid overnight.

This stay started terribly but the staff made up for it. We stayed here for one night the weekend after Christmas. We arrived a little after check-in time of 4 PM. We were told there are no rooms available and that we would not be able to check in until around 6 PM. They were pretty much telling everyone that. We were in town to shop so no big deal. We checked our bags and went shopping. They said they would text me when the room was available. We were out shopping and about 6:30 PM I decide to call and check in since we have 8:30 reservations for dinner. They tell me the room is still not available but they will 'put a rush on it' We got back to the hotel around 7 PM and checked to see if we could check in. They did have our room available even though no one thought to notify us. We got our room keys and went up to the room. Keys did not work. Went back and spoke to someone else said they wrote the wrong room number down. They did give us a drink and breakfast coupons which was nice. The room itself was nice and adequately sized for Chicago. There was a shower and a tub which was nice. We had a nice side view of Michigan Avenue from the 7th floor. After we returned to the hotel from dinner we stopped to get a drink in MJ's bar downstairs. It was nice with a decent crowd. The breakfast buffet was really good the next morning.The staff that we dealt with in person while checking in were very polite and apologetic. I am not sure that I would choose to stay here again given all the choices in Chicago. The location is great on Michigan Ave.
"I stayed there with my mother and gran. We stayed for 3 nights and there was a wonderful women there who helped us with everything we needed, she was funny and not as serious as i would've thought the staff here were. There was a Starbucks connecting to the hotel, and again the staff here were friendly and willing to help. The decor was beautiful and everything was clean. It was a good location and although the hotel was lovely, the prices of the stuff in the fridge however, were not. There was a walgreens and a 711 on every street corner practically! The water taxi was maybe 3 building away and you took this to pier 49. The tour bus was also just right outside. I would highly recommend this hotel if you were looking in this price range, worth every penny!"
"This lovely hotel has a exquisite swimming pool and meeting rooms that make you feel like royalty. Even the fold out beds are comfortable.But best of all, the staff is great.I was waiting for a package that did not arrive. I spoke with Sylvia Rollins about it and she very kindly and patiently asked about all the details. Then, she connected the dots and found a package that had been mailed to their hotel with the name of my company, but not my name or my room number. She was wonderful and I wanted to thank her in public.This note also can serve as a reminder -- if anyone is having a package sent to a hotel, be sure to have your name AS WELL AS your company name on the package.Thanks again to the Intercontinental for a wonderful stay."
"I spent 4 nights at the InterContinental recently and was definitely pleased with the property and the staff. The location was very convenient and allowed me to walk everywhere except to/from the airport (the train station is just a few blocks away). I stayed on the 26th floor but did have some road noise to contend with. I did find that he IHG website did not offer me the best rate on this particular stay however given that I have had problems with 3rd party sites in the past I will simply shop around and then call the property direct to make my reservation. Would definitely recommend this property if you are in the area.


Room Tip: If you are a light sleeper you might request a room in the back of the hotel to minimize the noise f...

Came to check in on Saturday in the morning with an extremely polite and professional female front desk agent with a unique name. Night Manager from the Previous night booked us into a Jr. Suite. My buddies loved the room as they could watch one football game and me and another could watch another game. Pool was great. Get there early or it will be overrun with kids (Understandable). Breakfast was on point. So many options. Will def stay again. Also Free WSJ in which i was a huge fan of at Breakfast. Great Location.
"We were up around the 30th floor of the historic tower, with three windows looking over the city and a sliver of the lake. Beautiful! There's a Starbucks attached to the lobby. Parking is outrageous though! Managed by an outside company. You can save $20+/night by walking a block or so and parking elsewhere. We left the kids with family so this stay was just my husband and I. The food at the attached restaurant was great too, and we had a lovely seat by the window watching life go by in Michigan Ave."
"Absolutely beautiful hotel, especially the historic tower. Fabulous swimming pool - for older children and adults. But not so family friendly for those traveling with smaller kids. The lobby has no place to sit and group. The pool is deep and cold - great for laps but not for small people. They also ran out of noodles and kickboards for the kids. We got ""shushed"" in the locker room talking with normal voice levels. One of the regular ""members"" scolded my daughter for entering the sauna, when I was right there supervising her, and there is no ""no children allowed"" sign on the door. Again, a beautiful hotel but I wouldn't take a youngster there again. I would give it a 5 star rating for business or couples. A three star for families with kids. Averages out to four star."
"We arrived on Christmas day and were a bit early. I expected to check our bags and return for check-in at the normal time. However, they allowed us to check-in early. They also accommodated our request for a high floor. The room was spacious, quiet, and clean. The beds were comfortable. The staff was responsive and friendly. The concierge were very helpful in locating a restaurant that was open for lunch on Christmas day. In addition to all of this, the location only adds to this hotel. We were in walking distance or a short cab ride from my favorite places and Michigan Avenue. My only complaints from the entire stay were the shower and the elevators. The showers lacked any significant water pressure. However, many hotels have this problem so it did not dampen my stay. The elevators were quite frustrating because it could take up to 10 minutes for an elevator to arrive when there was high traffic. We will definitely return to this hotel for another trip to Chicago."
"We have stayed at this hotel before and because we like "" The Barclay"" in NYC. We thought we would give the Mag Mile Intercontinental another try ( On our previous visit we had overcharges on our bill, and as a gesture of goodwill the hotel would upgrade us to the historic tower with a more luxurious room) So with family we travel from Heathrow Christmas morning. On arrival we were allocated a room which had been vacated by a previous guest, leaving change scattered around, empty shopping bags bed not made etc. ringing down to front desk we were called back down to reception to be allocated another room. On our way we checked with our other family travellers to find that they were also unhappy with their room as it was tired and scruffy. So after checking the newly arranged room for us we passed the room key to them. We then spoke with the front desk manager Raquel who apologised emphatically and immediately upgraded us to a suite. We went to this new room, opened the door to find it occupied with children's toys clothes etc scattered around. This was now our third room and were appalled that the guests security can be compromised in such a manner. Back down to reception and were allocated another room. This time we insisted the manager did the leg work and check the room. Finally we were in a room. We were comped a nights stay by Raquel. Juan from house keeping left a VM apologising for the mix ups. He also sent an apple, orange and pear as an apology.Over the course of our stay our other travellers experienced problems with the faucets, shower heat, and a rollaway was requested several times before it arrived.Had I been staying at this hotel and paying for the Internet service I would be extremely unhappy. Over my stay I found very limited speed, and constantly knocked off the service. So much so, I found the best time to check emails etc was to do this at 3 a.m. Or go to Starbucks downstairs when open.The breakfast buffet is excellent and most of the staff here were attentive and pleasant. Bearing in mind a hotel room is effectively your home when away, the seemingly lack of guest safety when the hotel was issuing room keys is very disturbing. Basically a could do better score with this hotel and the suggestion that some staff may visit "" The Barclay"" in New York to see how it's done.


Room Tip: High up in the historic tower is best.

"I will start off by saying the location is awesome. The linens comfortable, the shampoo smelled great and was ample. We took the audio tour and enjoyed it as well. Some things that people may find useful. * no hot tub*no vending machines we could find*wifi is not free*a soda from the mini bar is priced at $7.00 and it's a 12 ounce can. I also went down to the front desk two times during the day and there wasnt any staff at the desk either time. I had to stand there and wait several minutes before someone appeared. And I am a person who drinks soda instead of coffee. So I went out of my room walking the halls looking for the vending. I did not have shoes on because I thought it was only reasonable I would find vending machines quickly like in most hotels. Well I ended up being directed to the gift shop. I walked in and was about to grab the much needed Diet Coke and was yelled at by the clerk because I wasnt wearing shoes. And she kicked me out of the store. Instead of using tact and professionalism and simply alerting me to the error of my ways and asking me to please where shoes the next time I visited the store, she was rude. Or even asking what room I was in and offering to send up the beverages? That would have been a good solution. Yelling at me for something so minor was not a good solution."
"I had not previously stayed at this Intercontinental. Overall, I was very pleased with the service and the facility. Older hotels tend to have very small, dark and cramped rooms - fortunately I was provided a very nice suite upgrade. The service was very good, the valet parking attendant was helpful, and the lady at the front desk worked very hard to make sure that my room was ready before I headed upstairs. This hotel is known for the spectacular indoor pool - if you stay here this is a must-see - the hotel was built in the 20's as an athletic club, and the pool area was a focus of the architect's attention. The hotel has kept it very well maintained. The adjoining fitness center is functional and well maintained too. Food choices in the hotel include Michael Jordan's Steakhouse (did not eat there), a very nice wine bar and a Starbucks in the lobby. Overall a very good choice when staying downtown; just make sure that you request an upgraded room. Also a heads up that valet parking is now $65.00 / day."
"This was listed as a 4.5 star hotel and after staying my estimate is that it's more accurately a 3.5 star. It does offer room service, which we very much appreciate and made great use of. The valet service is really only half valet, you have to go down to the garage to pay for and receive your vehicle (and wait in a line that is usually ~20 minutes long).Perhaps other rooms are nicer but ours was decidedly not great; it seemed old, tired, not particularly clean and even had a previous guest's leftovers sitting prominently in the front of the mini-fridge/bar when we arrived. I've stayed in a number of truly 4, 4.5, and 5 star hotels and this does not come close. The location is great, room service is great, and if you get a good rate then certainly stay here. But if you're looking for a 4.5 star level hotel specifically, I'd look elsewhere."
"Perhaps it was just my corner room on the 29th floor . It was a nice view; a sliver of the lake out one window and a shot past the tribune tower down Michigan out the other two. It would have been better if the windows were clean but you can't have everything.You will hear sirens and traffic noise since the hotel is on Michigan and Michigan is an EMS route to I'm guessing NWestern's hospital. You'll hear fire trucks since you are near two fire stations. But mostly you hear and see EMS rigs., you'll hear the constant buzz of traffic and horns but mostly you hear sirens.I stayed in a single king in the historic tower which seemed a bit small compared to your typical hotel room. Another party I was with had a double queen room same tower on the 15th floor. Their room was larger (much) and even their bathroom was larger, but I'm guessing it was because the room I was in was a corner room.So lets start at check in. Around 3 I and the other party show up for check in. Both of which were staying on Chase bank visa free night vouchers. And both of which are platinum members of IHG hotels. We waited in the main check in line with about 5 others but were peeled off to the ""members only"" line to the left. and the person who attended to us was professional pleasant and interested in signing us up to the Ambassador level membership of Intercontinental..but we declined. (I don't stay at inter continentals enough)But the check in went fine and we were all off to find our rooms and just as we left check in we were both given envelopes containing letters promising something would be delivered to our rooms for being IHG members. Other than a newspaper the next morning nothing ever showed to either room. We were given starbucks coupons for a small coffee for each of our party during the check in process, which we used the next morning at opening of the store in the lobby, the staff did not seem too enthused that 4 people were all using free coffee vouchers. We were mostly alone in the store at that time maybe one or two others were already in the tables..so we weren't holding up a line of morning business people by using the free voucher but it just seemed we weren't welcome it was not a complex order 3 small coffees and one iced coffee.. All in all the hotel is nice enough, if you can get a room under 100 bucks the location alone is probably worth the stay, the ballrooms if you have a chance to wander the hotel are interesting to look at , in that they are all differently appointed. (start on the 9th floor and walk down the stairs that link all the ballrooms in a downward zig zag, or go up like I did and it's a better workout). The pool is nice to look at, and probably swim in.(12th floor?)Wi fi is free to IHG and probably ambassador level guests but non IHG members would have to pay to get wi fi, and it worked ok.You have a couple of choices for restaurants in the building and the location is within walking distance to other restaurants.There are only a few panhandlers on that block of Michigan avenue, and all of the panhandlers I passed in chicago in the loop area were not aggressive or threatening as they seem to be in warmer cities. Perhaps it's the amount of foot traffic around you. Or perhaps chicagoans just don't put up with aggressive panhandling.Check out was fine, fast .So other than the road and siren noise that migrates into the room and it's loud at times it's fine, shoot for a 2 bed double room in the historic tower if you want a decent sized room, if you want a room the size of a large prison cell a King on the 29th in a corner would suit your needs. (it was comfortable enough just smallish)."
"The place is really nice, warm and the rooms are well furnished. Nice bed and very comfortable. Try to be on the lake side because on the front, left and right side you can hear all the noise from the street specially sirens ( ambulance. police, fire dpt etc.... ) at night. The breakfast is just fabulous !!!! one of the best. Staff nice and professional. There is also a Starbucks near the entrance. Micheal Jordan's steak house is also attached to the hotel lobby. But at the end this hotel is situated on the Michigan Avenue the perfect place to visit Chicago

"The hotel was amazing the service was outstanding, the staff was so polite and helpful. The room was just perfect. The view of the city was breathtaking. The food at Michael Jordans Restraunt was so good, I cant wait to go back. This was one of the best hotels I have ever stayed at.

"I'm torn on giving this hotel a 3-star. My kids and I were excited to experience the historic feel of the Intercontinental, especially from photos of the pool and beautiful architecture throughout.We arrived on a Saturday evening after Christmas. There was a long line forming in the lobby, but only one person at the front desk to check everyone in. It seemed odd to me that a luxury hotel such as this should give so little attention to first impressions. The next evening when we came back from touring the town, our car parked in front for a good ten minutes before the doorman came out to give us a valet ticket.The room we booked was for two beds, but everything was out so they gave us an ""upgrade"" to a room in the historic tower with one king-size, with a rollaway bed to be delivered. Our first reaction when entering the room was that it was very small, with not even a sofa or upholstered chair for extra seating as shown in some of the photos. It was also an adjoining room with a door in the corner that made my kids nervous, so I asked to be moved but with no luck. The rollaway bed never came, despite being reassured by a second front-desk person during the phone call. My teen kids and I ended up all sleeping in the one bed. We couldn't help but feel very disappointed that first night.The next day we woke up to a beautiful view of the Tribune Tower out of one window and glimpses of the lake behind other buildings from the other window. The bed was firm and very comfortable so all of us rested well, and I actually was happy to not have a rollaway bed clutter the room. Went down for breakfast and found that they had a good variety of hot, cold, made-to-order, and even Chinese breakfast. We also got used to the room and appreciated the quietness high up in the tower where it felt like an isolated maze the night before.Overall, I would say that it was a positive experience, with room to improve on service and public spaces (dirty carpeting and floor tiles by swimming pool). The location can't be beat, but the historic elements of the hotel need some updates in order to shine instead of looking outdated. I would stay here again for the breakfast and location, but with everything else being mediocre, it makes more sense to try out other nice hotels in the area."
"Stayed at the hotel for two nights 16 November and arrived just as the weather changed and temperature was -12 c . We Rrived late evening and checkin was simple and straightforward. We had a room on 25 floor with a side view off Mitchigan, not much to see. Room was clean and welcoming. bed and pillows very comfortable, but the bed was very high and being 5.2"" struggled to clamber in which was quite hilarious. The carpet in the corridors left a lot to be desired, on first sight out of lift it looked worn around the edges and I wondered where I had come to, but realised it was just the pattern. Overall the hotel was clean and service good,. The Starbucks coffee shop was a welcome change to the coffee maker in the room. Also handy when returning from the extreme cold outside.We ate in the Michael Jordan's bar which was good food and service at reasonable price.Hotel is ideally situated for shops, river trips and sightseeing. We walked to Navy pier, which was signposted outside the hotel.Did not use any of the other facilities on offer as only there for 2 nights, butOverall a clean, well located hotel. Would certainly use again."
"Stayed one night at the Hotel Intercontinental with the family for a downtown birthday celebration. We had one room on the 37th floor of the Historic Tower and one in the Main Tower. Views from the Historic tower were great. Location is great - right on Michigan Ave across from Nordstrom's. Rates are not cheap - $322 per night. Parking is absurdly expensive - $65 per day. The rooms are nice. The linens are soft. The bathroom is marble. The Continental restaurant has a nice buffet breakfast, but it is $28 for adults and $8 for kids. The indoor pool is very nice and is accessible from either tower on the 12th floor. The fitness center is nice, free weights, treadmills and machines. Locker room has a sauna. There is a Starbucks and Michael Jordan's Steakhouse on the ground floor. If you can get a reasonable rate, this is a great downtown hotel."
"This is a hotel for business people and tourists. The staff is friendly, and service is very good. The room was bright, the bed comfortable, and the bathroom brightly lit with a good shower. This is one of the few hotels I have stayed in with a pool designed for lap swimming, and I took full advantage of it. Location is excellent. The red line subway is only a couple of blocks away, and it is easy to get around the city.


Room Tip: Both towers are fine.

"My wife and I recently spent a weekend celebrating our wedding Anniversary at this hotel. From the moment we drove up to the door till the time we left, we had a great experience. The location is wonderful for reaching any place in the downtown area of Chicago. Great food, shopping, museums, the beautiful lakefront and entertainment are literally moments away. All of the staff treated us with courtesy, kindness and respect. Our room was wonderful and we had a great view, looking west at the city. The room was large, clean and comfortable. We were sorry to leave! We will be back!"
"This hotel was perfect for my husband and myself...You are literally less than a mile away from the Navy Pier (back of hotel), Millennium Park (left of hotel), John Hancock Bldg (right of hotel), and straight ahead is shopping shopping shopping and lots of places to eat. Very similar to 5th Avenue in NYC but less busy and very clean city. We LOVED Chicago! My husband and I are IHG Gold members and are fans of the Intercontinental brand. It was what we expected. The service was exceptional from check in to check out. We arrived at the hotel at 8:00 a.m. and concierge did find us a room and we were able to go and sleep for a few hours until we were ready to get up and go out into the city. Since we are gold members we were given a access code for the gym and the wifi (no fee otherwise there is a fee). The pool is complimentary for all guests. Room 3704 (37th floor only 5 rooms on floor) - We were in the ""old"" tower. The room was a decent size with a large bathroom. King bed with feather down comforter and pillows (really comfortable). The room had 40 inch flat screen with tilt view. A safe and in room coffee maker (under TV in console). There was a desk/chair, a lounge chair in the room as well. The bathroom had a tub in the far corner and a stand up shower in the other corner. Small sink area although large mirror and area to lay your toiletries out. The towels weren't great I actually was kind of disappointed on the towels (texture not soft and fluffy or really large). The water pressure wasn't great the hotter you wanted the water. Other than that the restroom was great like I said it was really spacious. The tub set up was great. We never heard anyone else on the floor or on the elevators with us. We had a great view of the lake and the city side. We were told by a maid the ""old"" tower was going to be renovated in the spring. We were just curious because of reviews we had read. Our room was perfectly fine but updating a property never hurts!We used the gym it has state of the art cardio equipment but not so great weight equipment. It was fine but it would've been nicer if it matched the cardio equipment. Cardio on first level, weights and pool on second level (floor for gym/pool is FC).We did not eat at the Michael Jordan Steak house because we have one near us and wanted to try things we could only get in Chicago. I reviewed many of the places. There is Starbucks attached to the hotel lobby. There are Starbucks EVERYWHERE (I'm a Starbucks girl so I was really happy about that). In Starbucks there is a coffee carafe that says Intercontinental on it with cups near the sugar/milk station. I'm assuming it was Starbucks coffee complimentary for guests. I drink ice so I paid for mine. I thought that was nice. In lobby they also have computers set up so you can print your boarding passes another nice touch. We will be back and more likely than not stay here again! I would recommend this hotel."
"I stayed at this hotel for 3 nights for a business meeting. While this hotel has beautiful architecture, the rooms were ordinary. If I were to visit the Chicago again I would stay elsewhere. Positives: clean room, plenty of power hook ups in room, great lemon verbena soaps Negatives: room not ready until after checkin, bags took 30 mins to arrive at the room, the concierge did not answer the phone the 2 times I calledThe worst part, when our bus arrived a staff member came running out of the hotel yelling at our driver because he parked partialy in front of a private garage space. There was no one needing out of the garage. He continued to yell at our driver, who did not have anywhere else to park, until all of our luggage was unloaded. Needless to say this unprofessional employee started our stays out on the wrong foot. Kudos to our driver for not engaging. Slow service at the restaurant did not meet expectations. Lastly, the bed was a rock."
"I must admit that the Hotel is located right where you want to be if you are looking to do some shopping. Blocks away from some of the Top brand name stores. Nordstroms right in front. The Lobby has access to a Starbucks and Michael Jordan's Grill. The breakfast is a little pricey at $28 USD per person at the Continental. Another downside about big city (Chicago, NYC, Etc) hotels is that they charge just about everything ! The Gym and pool has a fee. The Internet service has a fee! Etc. Etc. I would definitely stay again."
"I love to get away in my own city and this location can't be beat! Check-in, Valet-lower (Wacker) to make life easier, all easy and friendly. (Try ParkWhiz.) The ease of getting to the Lake for a night walk with the wicked waves of the Halloween Howler, walking up to Rush Street for dinner and cupcakes, people watching on Michigan Avenue and wandering along the river. The breakfast buffet and service was excellent but the concierge was the best! Rachel was able to get us into a restaurant that was booked and made suggestions that were appropriate for my 15 year old daughter and me... We secured tickets to the All-Blacks Game. (Who did they play?) Many concierges at other hotels seem stressed but Rachel took the time to deal with us in a friendly way, This location is the best. The rooms are okay, (although the bedding is great) but when we decide to stay in the city, and we get an awesome rate online, that is not our priority."
"Excited that I was finally going to stay at the Chicago Intercontinental storied hotel. Upon check in I was processed like a slab of beef and religated to the ""new"" tower. The ""new"" tower was a soviet era housing block glued onto the historical tower. The room - sub par. Threadbare towels, tiny space, a decor from the early 90s. The only good thing I can say about my experience is that I received a free cup of Starbucks. I travel to Chicago monthly and can say that this hotel has nothing on its Magnificent Mile counterparts.Avoid."
"I attended a conference at the Intercontinental and stayed in a 6th floor corner room. The room was clean, the bed was very comfortable and the conference room was gorgeous. I've got a thing about water pressure at hotels (because so often it is lacking) but the pressure here was great. The corner room offered nice views and plenty of light. Best of all was the location, which was central for the other meetings I had scheduled in Chicago. I did not eat at the Michael Jordan's Steakhouse on the first floor, but the bar was a nice cocktail venue after a long conference day. Also having a Starbucks in the lobby is always a plus. My only knocks would be (1) the room was very small, which wasn't a problem for me alone, but it would get cramped quickly with a family in tow, and (2) there are apparently sensors on the wine tray next to the TV that detect movement of product and automatically charge the room if anything is moved (I was erroneously charged for a bottle of wine, although they corrected my bill before checkout). I would stay again."
"Our family have had many happy experiences at Intercontinental hotels at many locations around the world. We choose Intercontinental hotels because they have a good reputation and you generally know they will be of a certain level of comfort etc. However that is not true for this hotel. My husband and I asked for a king room when we booked in July, there were plenty of rooms available, we were given a twin room that is so small you can't move around the beds with ease. When we booked in yesterday and discovered the twin beds we asked if we could have a room with a king bed but we were told there was none available. We have since looked on the hotel website and have found rooms available so we will go down and ask again this morning and see what happens.There is a coffee machine, with the worst coffee in the world (in my opinion), but what's worse than the worst coffee in the world is the fact that they have given us TWO disposable cardboard cups too drink it out off! When I had a bath the bath mat slipped on the floor as I got out it's lucky I was holding onto the towel rail. After my bath I got too dry myself off with the pieces of sandpaper that they are calling towels. The air conditioning unit, my husband best described it has sleeping next to a running train because that's how loud it was. Some people might say too turn the air con off but we shouldn't have too. I know that the room must have been recently painted because there is paint splattered all over the window. It would be a shame to see our association with this chain of hotels come to an end but I feel that this will be the most likely outcome."
We just spent 2 nights at this amazing hotel. Our king size bed room was huge and had a very spacious bathroom. Our view from the 18th floor was incredible of the river and beyond. The swimming pool was magnificent and had an incredible old world charm to it. The staff were helpful and friendly. The location was perfect! We walked to Navy Pier and to the Art Institute. Many restaurants were close by too in this very safe area. The valet parking was so easy for drop off and pick up. We will definitely stay here again! The hotel is right next to the Chicago Tribune building. If you get a chance to walk around that building it is quite interesting to see the 149 artifacts of stone from around the world embedded into the street level view.
"This Intercontinental Hotel has the perfect location in the heart of Chicago, on Michigan Avenue. It is a large property, so there is always a whole bunch of hustle and bustle. I had to wait a long time to both check in and check out. But once you get to an agent, they are all very gracious and nice. Actually, the service from the staff has improved over the past few years.The hotel itself is in an older building. This actually used to be the Sheraton Chicago (a long time ago!). But it's upkept fairly well. The rooms have been slightly remodeled. Rooms are on the smaller side, but they layout is user-friendly. The bathroom is ok. Not too big, but not tiny either. Water pressure isn't the best. The housekeeping isn't the most meticulous, as the counters and floors weren't cleaned that well. Replenishing shampoo and soaps was hit or miss. (but a call down to the desk, and I had more than enough shampoo for the rest of my stay!)There is a Starbucks on property. It's convenient, but always packed too. Being an Intercontinental member gets you a complimentary coffee (or tea) at Starbucks. And also free Wifi and gym usage. There's also a steakhouse and a wine bar. But this is Chicago--there's also a lot of dining and drinking options just right outside as well."
"This hotel has seen better days. Pros: clean room, friendly staff (concierge, bellman, cleaning people), decent location, swimming pool kinda cool, reminiscent of a gilded ageDrawbacks: room was incredibly dark, even after they brought in an extra lamp (one of the bulbs in the current lamps was burnt out). Decor dark gold, which combined with the small windows made this a rather depressing room. Charge separately for wifi (not exactly a 4.5 star feature). Fitness center tiny. When the staff person brought up the extra lamp, she was apologetic for the darkness, and indicated that the hotel was going to be re-done soon. Probably not soon enough."
"The best thing about this hotel is the location--right by the Tribune Tower & Michigan Ave bridge, so you are just steps from world class shopping and restaurants.Originally built in 1929 as a men's club, the hotel lacks the feeling of old world luxury generally found in preservation hotels. There are 2 towers, one ""historic"" and one modern, with little difference in the rooms. We stayed in one of the ""historic"" tower rooms, which mirrored rooms at big chain, moderate-priced business hotels. However, I was staying with an older family member who was visiting the city, so location was the most important factor for us. If you stay at the hotel, stop by the coincierge desk to pick up an iPod featuring an audio tour of the original Athletic Club public spaces. The tour takes less than 30 minutes and directs you to some interesting interior spaces.

"Check in was effortless, in a welcoming foyer/reception, the room easy to find and enough lifts to make it a quick journey. The room was lovely but the beds were small doubles so comfy for one. Shower pressure could have been better. But the bathroom was spacious and it was all very clean. Beer and a snack in Michael Jordan's were most welcome, politely served and not too pricey. The view of the city in the morning was wonderful, and the checkout slick. Biggest gripe - being asked to pay additionally for wifi at the price charged per room felt very greedy."
"We stayed there last weekend for a girls trip of museums and shopping - it really is an ideal location. We asked for a room in the refurbished tower - as opposed to the historic tower. It was a nice room but the only drawback is that it's very small but the beds were great. They have a Starbucks in the hotel, and a lovely historic pool too. The staff is very helpful and friendly. I'd stay again, if I got a good deal.

"Spent an overnight at this hotel with my wife for our Anniversary. When booking I was looking for a Hotel with a good rating, exceptional service and great location. Based on the cost for the room I was disappointed. Our room was clean, bed was comfortable but the size of the room was very small. Whatever you do, do not touch anything in the fridge until you know the cost of the item your taking out. A small bottle of water was $5.00. The staff was nice but just seemed like they were there to do their job. I would not say that they were exceptional by any means. It is a very nice hotel if your looking for location. I thought the cost for parking was extremely outrageous (65.00) for an overnight but I was okay with it based on how convenient it seemed. That was until I had to wait 30 minutes to get the car back when we were leaving. We live in the burbs of Chicago and have spent many overnights at different hotels in the same general area as the InterContinental at a much cheaper price. Based on price and service, I would say this hotel is average. Nothing special unless your looking for location."
"I bid through Priceline and blindly got this hotel--it ended up being a decent stay.Very clean, decent lighting, comfortable bed, so-so pillows and well stocked. It was nice to have a fridge in the room, but it was pretty well stocked and didn't leave too much room for take out. Yes, the sensors in the minibar are on a timer and are annoying. But, it's a relatively common practice. Outrageous parking fees. Outrageous. I cannot comment on wifi, amenities or food as I spent a long weekend out on the town with local friends. Overall, it was a decent stay. The lower price I paid from Priceline evened out with the high parking fees. I didn't feel it was a 4 star hotel as I expected a little more. However, I'll stay again based on location and cleanliness alone."
"My husband and I booked this hotel through hotwire (which we use all the time). We chose the hotel because it was listed as a 4.5 star. The Intercontinental is FAR from 4.5 stars. That rank is based on name only. Only thing this hotel has going for it is the great location. We checked in to the hotel and were given what was is probably the ""hotwire"" hotel. I tiny odd shaped dark, dingy, and musty room. We complained about the room and were moved into a larger handicap room. Because this was handicap accessible the fixtures and whatnot were not as nice. The A/C in this room did not work so at 4:30am we requested another room and they sent keys up. We packed up and went to the other room and the keys would not work. Security came to assist us and we found as we entered the new room that ther was already guests in that room sleeping! In this day to walk in and suprise someone sleeping could be very dangerous!! You never know who those people were! We went back to the lobby where we had to wait for about 30 minutes for the ONE clerk on duty to go in the back office and speak with the manager. They came back with keys for another room. This room was small but much newer and brighter then the first two. A few other notes- the towels are HORRIBLE! They are small, shabby, and worn. I could not even wrap one around myself and I could see through the worn sections on them. The shower smelled of mildew like they used dirty rags to clean it. The staff was rude and not helpful at all despite all the issues we had. They could have cared less that we were unhappy!! I will NEVER stay at another InterContinental again. My husband and I travel quite often and normally stay at Hilton or Westin. I will stick with these top brands! I have never complained or posted complaints about a hotel in the past but I feel this is a must so that other's aren't fooled by this hotel.


Room Tip: Do not stay here if you want a good room!

"I'm not sure why this hotel is rated as a 4.5 star hotel. There was nothing special about this place. Rooms were ok. We had three rooms. Avoid rooms in newer tower, very tiny could barely get around in it. The historic tower had a little bit bigger room. Windows were absolutely filthy, they needed a good cleaning. Front desk staff was friendly. Not a bad stay, but if a hotel is rated 4.5 stars, I would expect more than what was there."
"Had a one night business trip to the Chicago area and have been a platinum member for the intercontinental hotel group for over a decade, so I figured I would finally splurge on the ambassador level and try this one; after all it's across the street from the Purple Pig, which is one of my favorite restaurants in the city. I can't say that there is anything wrong with the hotel; it has a fabulous location and is quite comfortable. I was very disappointed in the service, though. First, the receptionist did not recognize me as an ambassador member and declined to upgrade my room despite the ""guaranteed upgrade"" advertised for the loyalty program. Instead, she told me my room would be very nice and an upgrade would entail an additional cost if I really wanted it. So much for that.Second, there was no fresh fruit in my room despite that benefit advertised for the loyalty program.Third, the only bottled water in the room was in a minibar that carried the warning that I would be charged if anything was removed for more than 30 seconds. (It might have been 15 seconds, but I don't recall exactly.)All in all, this didn't make me feel terribly welcome. In addition, IHG advertises a welcome gift for ambassadors; mine seemed to be a coupon for a tall Starbucks coffee, though I read a few other reviews from folks also getting them that don't mention the loyalty program. The problem for me was I had an early meeting about half an hour away, so left prior to the Starbucks being opened. Overall, I regret having blown the 32,000 points on the upgrade because of the lack of any different treatment (and, in fact poorer treatment) than I get at a Hotel Indigo or Holiday Inn. Disappointed, though the hotel is physically one of the better IHG properties.


Room Tip: Wifi is free for IHG loyalty club members.

"Being located on Michigan avenue, it is hard to beat from this standpoint. The rooms are okay, not fantastic but ok. Front staff could show a little bit more attention towards guests (like smiling for example), but overall ok too. Pay a visit to the historic tower, it is really interesting for the architecture and decoration. The pool is also absolutely beautiful and retains a lot of the atmosphere of the pace, that used to be a gentlemen's club. A little complain on room service that is really pricey, although the quality of the food is above par. The major complain is regarding the in-room wifi, priced at 19.95 $ for a supposedly premium connection. Well, this turned to be one of the worst signals I have encountered in a long time...! Really a shame.Overall this property would remain my second choice in Chicago, after the Sofitel, which has a fantastic feel, design and decoration. The breakfast there is also 10 times better than at the Intercontinental, both in terms of quality of the offer and atmosphere of the room. The breakfast room at the intercontinental is terribly depressing!!! Happy travels to all.

"My girlfriends and I meet up somewhere for a girls trip once a year. Because of the prices of airfare and access from our various airports, we decided to spend a long weekend in Chicago. I am usually in charge of choosing where we stay so I decided to take a chance on Priceline and we got a fairly good deal on this hotel.When we arrived, the lobby was packed, but the hotel was the fully staffed and check in was fast. Marcus was friendly and gave us two great rooms, side by side. He also gave us some free drink tickets fir the Michael Jordan restaurant downstairs.The location is perfect for shopping, eating and sightseeing. The Purple Pig is right across the street and is a must visit for any adventurous food and wine lover.My only disappointment with the hotel is the charge for the gym and pool."
"This hotel has it all. Fantastic location on Michigan Avenue, as an IHG Platinum member, I try to stay at IHG hotels when I can. While this is an older hotel, it is kept up wonderfully. The lobby was nice, the room was clean and well kept. The front desk on check in was extremely cordial, as well as the rest of the hotel workers I came in contact with. Michael Jordon's steakhouse in the lobby was also excellent (see review).


Room Tip: I think only IHG members get free wi fi in the room.

"The location of this hotel is great. Everything you would want in Chicago is a walk away being centered in the heart of Chicago. Great views as well; The tribune tower to the north, Michigan Ave to the west, Lake Michigan to the east, and water tower are to the north. You will get a true sense of the amazing Chicago architecture at Intercontinental Chicago.

"This is the only hotel I would stay in when I visit Chicago again. I wouldn't say it was a 5 star hotel, but it certainly was a 5 star experience. First of all, let me say that the location was BRILLIANT!!!! Although the rooms are a little old, they were clean and very comfortable and practical. Our room had a view of the Magnificent Mile and Lake Michigan. We received Starbucks coffee vouchers from the front desk when we checked in, and even though I don't like Starbucks (I mean, why would you drink Starbucks with Eataly around the corner from the hotel?), it was a lovely gesture. And because we'd had delayed flights due to the drama at Chicago O'Hare a week or so before our trip, the front desk gave us drink vouchers for the Michael Jordan Steakhouse located in the hotel.They have coffee making in the room but I like my cup of hot tea every morning, and once I realised I had to ask for a cup, saucer and teaspoon as well as the hot water, all was good with the world. (Can't stand paper cups for tea and those silly little straws. Try getting a teabag out with one of those! Paper and plastic - my pet peeve!). Come on Intercontinental!! Get real cups and teaspoons in the rooms! I'm sure you have a dishwasher.There is also a shelf in the fridge for your own water or drink - a nice touch and appreciated.I took advantage of their indoor swimming pool, which apparently is the oldest in Chicago. It was great!Would definitely stay there again.


Room Tip: Air conditioning/fan was noisy..but my husband likes the noise.

"Wow. I was extremely impressed with this hotel. Actually I can't begin to describe how impressed I was with this hotel. I am a Platinum IHG Rewards Club member. I always hope for an upgrade, but definitely don't expect it. I really didn't expect an upgrade when I arrived at 11AM. I got there early, and the hotel already confirmed an upgrade to a huge suite for me. After I sat in this room for 20 minutes not believing they would actually give me such a huge room, I decided to talk to the concierge to see about night life. The concierge desk was busy, so I approached the bell captain. He took probably 15 minutes out of his busy schedule to recommend different places. He set up dinner reservations for my friends and I. He then recommended several bars and clubs for us to go to. His suggestions were great, although we did question it when we arrived at the hotel at 5AM (this club closes at 5AM). Just kidding! We had a blast! Overall, I had a top notch experience. I was treated extremely well, the service was second to none, and the physical condition of the hotel was pristine despite the fact it is an older building."
"We arrived as a last minute check-in while downtown a couple Friday's ago. We used an on-line hotel reservation and found the reservation pretty cheap and expected to get stuck in a pretty cheap room. Much to our surprise we found ourselves in the original tower with a nice sized king room that had an actual sit-down-comfy-chair and not just a desk chair (although it had that too). It was a comfortable evening and we were glad to be there. I would not have spent the money to actually book the room with InterContinental, through their on-line booking tool, because it would have been way too pricey, esp for a last minute, late arrival, but this cheap find was really great! (Remember, ask for a room in the old tower that is going to be remodeled in winter 2014)


Room Tip: Rooms in the original tower have a bit more square footage, and stay away from the elevator and ice...

"Located on the Magnificent Mile, it is only blocks from all the great stores. The staff is attentive and helpful. But for the price, the rooms in the old tower are dark and poorly appointed in terms of comfortable and useable furniture for a business trip. The rooms in the new tower are better appointed but smaller. Add to that extra charges of $20 a day for Internet access and relatively poor choices of channels on the TV ( had to go to the bar to watch the game that everyone in the bar wanted to watch) and I would never stay there again, especially with a MarriottAnd a Conrad across the street."
"The hotel overall was very nice. My room was quite small and could use some updates. But the location cannot be topped. I was able to walk to all of the major stores that I wanted to visit in between meetings at the convention I was attending. The America Girl Store was about a 10 minute walk and the big mall (Nordstrom, etc.) was directly across the street. There is a Starbucks right in the lobby, which was a HUGE bonus for me. Michael Jordan's restaurant is also located inside and was FABULOUS!!!! Our meeting space was adequate and the ballroom was great! The group was around 260 people, which fit perfectly. The stage and screen for the presentation was nice and large. There is also a second tier in the ballroom if you had a larger group and needed the additional space. The second tier offered a great view to the stage.

"My sister picked this hotel, but I was impressed by the condition and quality of the Intercontinental. From the reception and room service to house keeping and concierge, everyone was friendly amidst a not-always pleasant Chicago crowd. The hotel boasts several restaurants, including Michael Jordan's steakhouse plus an on-site Starbucks which my sisters were thrilled about. You can easily catch the red line subway about 4 blocks west of the property. The blue line is about a 3/4 mile walk which was easy to get to and from. I actually took the blue line from O'hare to Clark/Lake then walked to the hotel. While I didn't eat at the hotel, my sisters enjoyed their room service and the Starbucks like I mentioned. There is a Walgreens about a block and a half away which has amazing fresh juices and smoothies. There is also a terrific restaurant across the street called The Purple Pig. Back to the hotel...the rooms are adequate in size, maybe a little small with 2 full-sized beds but they are very comfy beds with cozy sheets and soft pillows. I hate when pillows are hard and my chin is on my chest! The bathroom was a great size, the water pressure was great and the toiletries were stocked daily. I love that the room had a mini fridge for drinks or leftovers which we had a couple of times. There is a lot of trendy shopping nearby plus eateries and Navy Pier is only 4 blocks east. Even getting to our segway tour was a breeze and only a mile away. There is a lot of nightlife (lounges, bars, clubs) nearby, so either walking or taking a short cab ride is a breeze. I do recommend staying in this hotel if you like the Magnificent Mile area."
So this hotel is not up to the usual intercontinental standard but in fairness it's working within the architecture of an old building. So you trade the usual comfort for the great location. Staff are friendly and while they acknowledge your Ambassador status as a club member there are no bells and whistles. The welcome letter said a choice of welcome amenity or points we were just given points. We would have chosen the amenity if we has been given a choice and no room upgrade. Despite being platinum ambassador members with a guaranteed room upgrade we only got the room we paid for. Well not exactly we got two standard adjoining rooms one with a long instead of the bed. So it wasn't a suite and with only a narrow adjoining door you don't use the second room as it isolates you from your companion. I have spent more than 100 nights in intercontinental properties worldwide. This one is very basic. We would not return to it on future visits and if it weren't for the location I would have scored it 2. The rooms are very disappointing when you compare it to the usual intercontinental standard
"Stayed at the Vice presidential suit, very spacious, very nice value but the hotel is too old and needs a lot of renovation, staff are friendly in general, their GM was standing in the lobby and greeting guests which is a nice gesture.Concierge staff are nice but I believe they need younger guys who are aware of the nice restaurants and activities.Was disappointed to know that there is no club lounge in the hotel.Location is great, walking distance from everywhere.I would frankly consider it more of a crown plaza than an intercon."
"Stayed here this past Saturday night with my husband and family. The hotel is beautiful and you can't beat the location!! The staff was extremely accommodating and very knowledgeable. This was my second stay in the last couple of months and this has become my favorite hotel in Chicago. Don't even get me started on Eno, how can you miss with amazing wine, cheese and chocolate? I wish I had more time to visit!!!"
The best thing about the hotel is location and their amenities. They even have a Starbucks off the lobby!. The rooms are average but clean and comfortable. Our bathroom did not have a vanity so it was awkward with 2 people. The staff is friendly but sometimes not enough of them at the front desk. There could be annoying waits at peak times. The bell staff is great and attentive.We did not frequent the restaurants but the wine bar is great. They have cheese and chocolate and a friendly staff who remembered our names.
"I stayed in this hotel about 6 months ago. So it could have changed. I have to admit it was reasonably priced but the hotel was not welcoming at all. Service and staff was ok, it has a great location and you can walk out of the hotel and walk around perfectly. However, rooms are horrible. Very dark, hard mattress, hard towels and no free wi-fi (even though they claim they do have free wi-fi. When I asked they said it was free.... inside Starbucks). Overall my personal experience was poor. I do recommend you stay in this hotel if you are going to spend very little time in the hotel and are looking for a good location."
"On our way home we made a stop in Chicago for shopping. I checked for hotels and came to the Interconti. The welcome at the reception was really nice and friendly (maybe the friendliest of the hole trip) .Our room at the 10th level was nice, but quite dark due to the privacy shield, but otherwise clean and the beds were fantastic. The Bathroom was ok. We also went to have a look to the pool, wow.... i could start swimming here... would stay here again."
"Staff, service is very pleasant and helps make the stay worthwhile. When booking, I told them of the occasion, and upon checkin the staff all provided best wishes. Very nice touch, as it truely made my wife feel special. only thing, is I wish car checkout improves, as you must walk into the bowels of the basement, fetch you car, nobody assisted with luggage, then you have to find your own way back up to Michigan Ave...


Room Tip: Ask for room above 30gh floor, as views are great !

"We stayed in the historic tower. Our room was spacious and our bed was comfortable. The room needs a dresser with drawers, but other than that no complaints. The lounge on the 32nd floor has a great view. We bought a bottle of wine walking home from dinner and took it up there to enjoy the view and have a night cap with our friends. Our room didn't have a view, we overlooked an alley and office buildings."
"I have stayed at this hotel on two occasions. My most recent stay was during the first week of September. The location of this property is fantastic! It is within walking distance of the Navy Pier, many great restaurants/bars, and all of the great shopping on Michigan Ave. It really is located in the middle of everything. The staff were kind and helpful on both of my stays. The lobby is very nice and there is a steak restaurant and a Starbucks located just off of the lobby. On both of my visits I was given a room on an upper floor (floor 20+) with windows overlooking Michigan Ave. The beds are very comfortable and the bed linens are nice. I didn't have any problems keeping my room temperature where I wanted it. The window actually opens! Also, on both of my visits the price I paid was rock bottom. I purchased the room as part of a flight/hotel package and the price just couldn't be beat.Okay, on to the the reason I only gave this property 4 stars. The rooms are very very small. I was traveling with a friend and we had a room with two beds. There was a chair in the corner of the room that was just inches from touching the bed. There is a desk in the room and if you sit at the desk no one can get around you to get to the bathroom, closet, or door. There is very little storage in the rooms. The rather large nightstand looks like it has two pretty deep/large drawers....it doesn't. The top ""drawer"" is actually the safe and the bottom drawer doesn't open. It is completely wasted space in a room that can't afford to waste space. There are only 3 small drawers located just under the tv. There is a closet which is a standard size closet. The shelf in the closet is taken up with extra blankets. There is not one place to put anything in the bathroom except the counter top. I like to try to keep things neat and orderly, but with such little storage it is a challenge in these rooms. The bath towels are a bit thin for my taste. The bathroom doesn't have a separate bathtub and shower. It has a standard bathtub with a shower head in it. There is very weak water pressure. The decor seems nice at first glance but as you look at things you start noticing layers and layers of paint, scuffs, and general wear and tear. It seems to me that this hotel does a lot of convention business, as there are many people walking around with name tags on. Every night of my recent stay I had to listen to my loud neighbors who came in after midnight each night. Having said that I think if your neighbors speak with normal volume you probably won't hear them, but if you have a ""loud talker"" as a neighbor, you are going to hear them. Would I stay here again? Sure. The location and price are really something that can't be beat. But, having said that, I think that the next time I go to Chicago I would like to try something else."
"This was the second time my son and I stayed in this hotel and we will continue to come back to the hotel as long as Arron remains there. He went out of his way for us and made us feel special as guests. The hotel is good, some of the rooms, although clean and comfortable to stay in are too small. But it will always be our first choice given it will be good to be welcomed again by Arron. Thank you Sir."
"My husband and I came to Chicago for a Get Away weekend. We love this hotel but this time our stay was outstanding. We got checked in by a very nice lady with a great smile, she mentioned my IHG rewards membership and gave us a complementary Coffee Voucher for Starbucks- perfect!When we got to the room Chocolate Strawberries and Champagne was already waiting for us, we were ready to start our Anniversary weekend. The room was amazing! We loved it!Bob the Concierge recommended a stylish restaurant ""Bellwether"" (just 2 blocks from the hotel) for dinner. Cool place. After our Main course our server told us that Bob called the restaurant and would like to invite us for a dessert our choice. Such a nice surprise :-)Because we had such a great time we asked Elijah at the Front Desk if we could extend our stay for one more night without moving rooms- no Problem!I cannot wait to come back to the IC Chicago- Thanks again!

"We couldn't have picked a better spot to vacation in Chicago. We were in walking distance to great shopping, restaurants and attractions.Also, we had a health emergency and could walk to North Western Hospital.Our room was quite large with fantastic soft sheets.The pool was huge, but could have been warmer.Michael Jordan's restaurant located in the lobby was delightful too.We would definitely book this hotel again."
"I stayed here for two nights in order to go to a concert at Soldier field. The location from Soldier field was great, it was about a 40 minute walk but easily found. There are many great stores and food chains all on the same street as the hotel. The staff were very friendly and willing to take and/or hold your bags even after you were checked out of the hotel room for the weekend. Over all the hotel was clean, friendly, beautiful, and in a great central location. I highly recommend staying here."
"The building from the outside does not stand out that much. But That might be because it can't compare to the buildings surrounding it. Right next door is the stunning Tribune Tower. We were lucky enough to stay on a high level with a view of the Tribune Tower, The Chicago River and Lake Michigan it was amazing!Take the time to explore this hotel. There are 6 or 7 levels of banquet rooms that are stunning and historic. The pool makes you feel that you stepped into Chicago in the 1920's. This is an awesome hotel."
"We visited the Hotel in late July 2014 and it exceeded our expectations!!! We stayed in the historic tower and had a partial view of the Chicago River. The room was spacious and the bathroom was pretty large. The location was spot-on as we were in walking distance to many of the area attractions.All of the staff was very pleasant and seemed happy. We especially want to acknowledge Clive, the valet. Clive was very helpful with directions, he suggested a great restaurant and was always aware of our presence and made sure that our needs were met. We expect to return to Chicago in October and we will be sure to tip Clive for his great service as we were in a rush to get to the airport when we left. Thanks Clive!We also visited the breakfast buffet every day and it was phenomenal. They had a vast selection of breakfast food and you could even get omelets, waffles and other items made to order.

"I recently stayed at the Intercontinental for 7 days. The location can not be beat. It is walking distance to everything! Beach, navy pier, millennium park, etc. The hotel is really lovely. I stayed in the historic tower on the 33rd floor and the view was amazing. The service at the hotel is excellent leaving you wanting for nothing.The room was exceptionally nice, huge bathroom with all the amenities including a scale. The gym is 2 stories with plenty of equipment. The pool is indoor and huge. I would definitely stay there again.

"Can't beat the location......right in the heart of the city - convenient to everything. But....I had no windows in my room.....none. It was on the ""historic"" side of the hotel and was well maintained, clean, comfortable. Very nice window treatments but no windows. I was at a meeting and was checked in and unpacked before I noticed. But I DEFINITELY think that should have been disclosed to me upon check in. Or this room should be offered with a discount. In hindsight, I certainly should have given the hotel a chance to remedy on day one. But it definitley negatively affected both my stay and my impression of the hotel."
"We are IHG members and always enjoy coming to Chicago and staying at the Intercontinental. The stats is always friendly starting right at valet and throughout the hotel. The pool is just a fantastic experience and feels like you are back in a classic movie. Just a quick tip....if you want a larger room stay in the older part of the hotel. We realized this after staying in the newer tower and we stayed with two of our children, one of which is an infant. There was no place to put her pack-n play for her to sleep. We had to literally move furniture because it was so tight. The beds are very comfortable bed but if you are sharing a double bed with a spouse or someone else, thats a bit tight as well. The Starbucks coffee vouchers are a a nice plus. The location is perfect. Close to everything downtown...restaurant, shops, boat tours are right downstairs, and the views (if in the right spot) are great!The only negative that would deter me from staying there again is the constantly increasing fee for parking. The last time we stayed a few months ago it was $50. We were just there over the weekend and now it is $65. NYC isn't even that much anywhere! The cost of the hotel plus parking is worse than a plane ticket with added fees.

"A two night stay at the InterContinental was mandated by meetings held there. We were glad! The room was very comfortable, near the elevator but quiet due to floor design. This grand old hotel is gorgeous, in an excellent location, and the service matches the hotel. We shopped the price and did pretty well--off the face-value of the room.Thank you! Oh, and the breakfast was excellent.The Chicago River architectural tours dock less than two blocks away. A great little treat to fit in. And of course the InterContinental is a headliner, with its own unique history.

"I work at a hotel, so it's always nice to be at the other end of the desk and enjoy a getaway. I planned a trip to Chicago for my birthday, and I was floored by the service I received.It started with Kiran at the front desk. She was incredibly helpful and friendly. As an IHG member, I asked to see if it was possible if I could get a 1:00pm check-out. ""How about 2:00pm?"", she replied. Not only that, but I received a follow up call shortly after arriving to my room to see if I enjoyed everything in the room - this is top notch service. The service continued at The Continental for breakfast the next morning. I was warmly greeted by 3 differently people. The hostess and I had a short and friendly conversation. Soon after, one of the outlet managers said hello, and said if I needed anything that I should not hesitate to ask. My server, Uygun(sp?), was one of the nicest servers I've had the pleasure of meeting. Through engaging conversation, I learned that him and most of the staff have been there 10+ years, and it really showed. He continually refilled my orange juice, without me asking or hesitation, even when it was just above half full. He overheard that I was thinking about getting made-to-order pancakes, but I didn't want to bother since it was near the time they would close. He went ahead to the back and had them make it anyway. All this...along with a beautiful hotel. When you check-in, the wall behind the desk is a giant screen showing live feeds of the city. The rooms views are truly remarkable. Everything was clean, updated, and elegant. There's nowhere in Chicago I would rather stay!"
"I stayed in the Intercontinental this last weekend when visiting Chicago this past weekend. It is a goal of mine to stay in every well renown hotel in Chicago at least once, this one included. Overall, this hotel is a classical Chicago Landmark, the only hotel with a grand main entrance on the Magnificient Mile portion of Michigan Avenue and is a historic masterpiece with old fashioned service values and several attributes not often found at other hotels. It was a very good stay for reasons I will get into-When one first comes to the hotel, they will notice the following, it is right in the heart of the Magnificent Mile and has a large rounded entrance at the bottom of a multi-corridor hotel. The hotel's exterior architecture suggests it is a landmark building which it most certainly is. One gets the feeling that several important things have happened here throughout its history which if one researches they will find to be true. There are several great hotels in the Near North Side where this hotel is located but this one stands out in that it is the only one whose main entrance is right on the Magnificent Mile and it will get more visibility from prospective tourists because of it.Entering the hotel, one will first notice a well tiled concourse between Michigan Avenue and the check-in area. Behind the check-in desk, one will notice a large set of TV screens which offers live camera views of the Magnificent Mile, and the rest of the Near North Side or the Chicago Loop from various angles of the building roof top. To the right is Michael Jordan's Steakhouse and to the left is a round staircase that goes to the second floor which has an upstairs private dining area of MJ's to the right and the Continental Restaurant to the left. Further to the right, one will notice the original entrance area where one begins the self-guided tour of the hotel which is offered here on an ipod provided by the hotel. If one takes the self guided tour which I personally highly recommend, they will see the meeting and reception rooms of this hotel which are grander than most hotels one is accustomed too. The tour area spans up to the 8th floor and one will come across the various rooms, the fitness center, the ballroom, and last but not least the elevated indoor pool which is a full size pool with 120,000 gallons of water in it. This whole part of the hotel was unique to say the least as I would've never expected to see all of this inside of a hotel. It was definitely something one cannot find elsewhere that will make the trip here more worthwhile.If one is looking to merely check in to their room while trying to minimally notice what is mentioned above, here is what will happen when one goes to the check-in area- they will come to a large desk with a very courteous and professional staff that are more accommodating than what one will find at other hotels. Even when the lines seem long, they move in a fast but friendly manner. The management knows that this hotel is well regarded and make a point of reinforcing it to the staff here. If one is looking to leave their bags with the concierge when trying to check in early, the staff will gladly deliver a guests bags to their room while they want to explore Chicago. One will then proceed to check into their room going to the elevator area which is to the right of the check-in desk. The hotel rooms span across several floors in a corridor style with various views of the rest of the surrounding area. The rooms themselves were extremely well presented with a large king size bed provided that was extremely comfortable to sleep in. Each room has a TV attached to a dresser with a refrigerator and snack selection that is quite good but unfortunately expensive. The room view I had was OK but wasn't the best view the hotel offers as it overlooked other buildings behind the main part of Michigan Avenue. The bathrooms were not as grand as the rest of the hotel with nothing majorly special provided inside of them (no tile showers or anything like that if one is expecting.) Overall, The rooms didn't seem very large but they were well done in every manner one can think of. lastly, If calling the service desk at this hotel, they greet you with a salutation of Mr./Mrs./Ms. followed by your last name as soon as they answer, that to me made the stay feel more inviting and special. Overall, this was a great stay for all the reasons listed above. The hotel bill was a bit steep (about $370 after taxes) but as it was a summer weekend in this part of Chicago, one would've paid a similar amount if they had stayed anywhere near here. I am very glad I stayed at this hotel and while it wasn't my absolute favorite that I have stayed in since exploring Chicago's hotels (so far my favorite has been the Wit), it is still a 5 star hotel on a 5 star scale and could be nothing less based upon all of the above listed information. One is in for a real treat here and one will not find the same things at a typical chain hotel that they will find here. This hotel is worth the experience fully, if one is looking to stay here, they will get everything they pay for.


Room Tip: Get a room that is located more on the West Side of the hotel as that will overlook the Mag Mile bes...

"I stayed here with my wife and 2 children (8 & 11 years old)...from the moment we stepped out of the taxi, the staff at this hotel made us feel welcome...we arrived around 11am expecting to have to wait for our room...we were given our room within 10 minutes of arrival...we ate breakfast from The Continental every morning...GREAT selection for breakfast...I got our breakfast to go every morning, so can't speak for waiter service, but after the first morning, the staff there called me by name upon my arrival...so, I would expect the service within the restaurant was great as well...this hotel is very conveniently located for bus stops (just outside the front entrance) and a little over a block away from the red line subway train entrance...multiple shops and restaurants are within walking distance from the hotel...and, there's a Starbucks in the lobby...all in all, great location if you are traveling to Chicago for a family trip...The only negative I would have for this hotel would be that the wifi service was not included...I was surprised when I logged on and was asked for payment info...not a big deal since we weren't in the room much, but if you are needing wifi service, be prepared to pay"
"We chose this hotel based on a wedding rate. I thought the check-in process could've gone a little bit faster than it did, but nothing major. I'm not sure what was going on with the front desk as a few people around me seemed to have complaints of mess-ups that were made. We requested two doubles but settled for a king and a cot. Was nice to have the cot already in our room when we were able to check in. My friends that were also staying here had an issue with check-in and got double beds when they requested a king. When I saw how much smaller their room was than ours and other guests in the elevator complained about the size of their room as well, I decided we shouldn't complain that we didn't get our initial bed request (since the room we were given was very spacious). I would've liked to have been up just a little higher to get a better view, but it was decent enough and thought our room size worked well for us. The location of the hotel makes it easy enough to get to just about any of the hot spots downtown without too far of a walk. I thought the free Starbucks coffee since we had to wait for our room to be ready was a really nice touch as well. If I could get another decent deal for a room rate I would consider staying here again."
"Booked this hotel for its proximity to the Marriott. We were meeting family who were staying there, and being almost across the street from each other was very convenient. Availability was limited, but we found ourselves a deluxe king room in the historic tower. We had a corner room with a great view of the Tribune tower, and out of the other window was a great view of the lake! The room was clean and the bed was comfy. We took advantage of their late checkout, well worth the $61 to be able to still have a home base while we toured the city and waited for our train out of town. Would love to stay again, and next time actually use their beautiful pool."
"I was upgraded to a room in the historic tower of the hotel. My room was on the 28th floor and offered views of Lake Michigan, Trump Tower and the architecture along Chicago's Magnificent Mile. The king bed was comfy with lots of pillows. The TV got a wide variety of channels and on demand movies. The bath was a 4 piece with a separate glass shower and bath tub. The elevators were fairly quick and well maintained. The prices for the conference were within reason but weekend rates after the conference were too pricey for my budget. A lovely property and a must do again!"
"The InterContinental is a nice hotel. Our group was there traveling on business. It is a busy hotel and everyone we met was friendly. I had a vehicle an Valet was fine, although it was $65/night. We got in early, so checked bags, which was painless, although it took 30 minutes to get our bags when we came back. There were lines during check-in, so another 30 minutes. None of this is necessarily ""bad"" - it's just the sign of a very busy hotel that's directly on Michigan Ave. Our room was small, but no smaller than say the Palmer House. The room was clean, there was a variety of pillows, the beds were firm, and the room was clean. The TV in the room didn't work and I didn't complain because I just wasn't in the room very long. However, I think the hotel's management should make sure of this stuff (e.g., cleaning staff) because the place appears to be primarily business travelers that just have limited time...The hotel has a Starbucks off the lobby, which we appreciated! There are also other coffee shops and restaurants close. Michael Jordan's steak house is adjacent."
"I love staying at the Palmer House for the convenience to downtown, food, and shopping. I also love the history of the hotel. I stayed for the Memorial Day weekend and was pleased the hotel wasn't crowded and the hallways were quiet, especially at night. The beds are comfy. What I don't like is how the bill they give you doesn't match the hold on your credit card and I always have to call to have it adjusted when I stay, even though they say it will be corrected in 3-4 business days anyway. This time it was a $50 hold plus tax for each night.


Room Tip: Become a HHonors member so you'll be on the higher floors away from the El.

"The Palmer House is a beautiful property with wonderful common spaces. However, it is much better to visit the Palmer House for a drink or meal than to actually stay in the rooms. The rates are much higher than other comparable hotels and the older property could use updates in many areas. The elevators are extremely slow and inefficient - I waited more than 10 minutes for an elevator on more than one occasion. The rooms, while acceptably decorated, have beds of only average comfort and small bathrooms with very noisy pipes and poor sound insulation between rooms. If I were to return to Chicago, I would stay a different hotel."
"The lobby of the Palmer House is lively, exciting and beautiful. One gets a great sense of history throughout the hotel. We stayed Memorial Day weekend and it was perfect for our trip. Reasonable rates and nice amenities right in the heart of the loop. Location is great, close to Michigan Ave, and the el. My wife and I thoroughly enjoyed our stay and will definitely go back.


Room Tip: upper floors are quieter

"Stayed at this hotel for a conference and would probably not return on my own. The property itself is gorgeous. It's a very old hotel and has an interesting feel, and it was fun to explore. The rooms are nothing special though. It looked like any other hotel room, but smaller. The bathroom felt like it was about 4 square feet and it also wasn't very clean. It's not cheap to stay here, although I believe it's comparable to other places in the area, and you really don't get much for your money. EVERYTHING is extra, and it's expensive. For the price, you can sleep there and that's about it. It also gets very crowded when there's any event going on, and it's packed and hectic there."
"Staying at The Palmer House really forces you to consider the idea of what makes a luxury hotel. Is it proximity? Comfort? Service? Amenities? Or is the core idea of luxury contained primarily within the confines of the room itself?This matters a great deal. The location, proximate to nearly everything Chicago has to offer in the downtown core on foot is ideal. The lobby itself is incredibly ornate and its own slice of Chicago history. A great many of the reviews you'll read about the property classify this, along with the service, as luxury.And that's fair. The service here, with the notable exception of the bartending staff at the bar portion of Lockwood's, is generally very good. Nearly everyone will great you with a smile. If you're Hilton Honors Diamond, you have your own separate desk and an Executive Elevator for stays on those floors.The amenities, including two onsite restaurants, an onsite Starbucks, excellent complimentary soaps/lotions etc. in the room, are also very good. The electronic in room concierge has some significant limitations, including clumsy UI and an inability to pre-order room service breakfast for the next day (something other chains accomplish with hang tags) but it's a nice effort.The value? Well, if you want value, you should stay at the Hampton Inn two blocks away. It's a terrific value. This place isn't cheap. Nor is the garage parking or the $75 daily valet. It's also the only time in my life I've paid $25 for a salmon bagel. But, to be fair, it was a really nice salmon bagel. Room service is so quick it's absurd.So if the amenities are great, the service is terrific and the location is top notch, why is this only a 3? Well, let's discuss the rooms. The showerhead is fantastic. I wouldn't leave my spouse for it, but I'd seriously consider an affair. It's a terrific showerhead. Beyond this, though, the rooms are terrible in three critically important areas:1) The beds. Even on the executive floors, these are Days Inn level beds. They're hard, lumpy dated mattresses with basic, unappealing uncomfortable bedding. The pillows are a notch above basic, but the sleeping experience on this bed is significantly below the price you're paying for the room, and that's assuming you can sleep at all because.....2)The noise. There is absolutely no soundproofing to speak of either from drunken floormates wandering back to their rooms at 3:15 a.m., or what they do once they get into their rooms after said wandering. Noise is constant from the outside as well. If you want a quiet room, this is not the hotel for you. And if you're counting on a significant noise filtering combination from the.... 3) Air conditioning, don't bother. In only one of the two rooms we stayed at on separate occasions did the air conditioning unit either blow in the general vicinity of the bed or make a significant dent in the noise from neighboring rooms. Cold air performance varies greatly depending on your room.And that's the rub, here. You can have the best service, best location and best amenities in the world, but if your rooms are terrible, you fail at the core of your mission, which is to provide your customers with a solid night's sleep. And a high cost of a stay makes these deficits stand out this much more than they would in a hotel with a lower rating.I want this to be a great property but, barring a bargain booking, I'd pass.


Room Tip: Get an end/corner room if at all possible, and bring ear plugs.

"The Palmer house is full of character and we stayed prior to taking the California Zephyr the next day - 18th floor was great and not too noisy from the L. Breakfast in the hotel was excellent - we had the cold buffet with a great selection for 18$. Staff were friendly and we had a 12 noon checkout with no extra charge. Highly recommended. Very comfy bed and room.


Room Tip: 18th floor away from the L was good

"We spent the Memorial Day weekend visiting Chicago, our third stay at the Palmer House. This time we were on the ""executive level"" (floors 22 and 23) which offers a cafe on the 23rd floor, serving breakfast, light snacks and a bar. Our best experience was meeting Earnest, who works at the cafe. He is one of the most positive, happy and genuinely kind people i have met in a long time. He's also in constant motion, working to make sure all are taken care of. He made the visit a special one."
"So this is a landmark hotel.. The public areas are truly spectacular - a visual treat - and perhaps even a reason to visit That said lets be clear that the hotel is tired. The rooms are small, my bathroom was a masterpiece of how to fit the basic sanitary requirements in a space that defied logic ! The phone system stopped working and I was surprised by two announcements from a hidden bedroom tannoy telling me so - seriously it was so loud I think they heard it back in England which was great because I was trying to get some sleep! Which brings me on to noise and the relentless ""music"" in the public areas... Guys turn it town a couple of notches and everyone will be happyOverall not worth the price of a hotel room .. But perhaps worth popping in for a coffee to see the fantastic public space - but bring ear plugs !"
"Well, I have to admit I enjoyed my stay. The lobby area is beautiful, and I loved looking at all the autographed photos lining the hallways. But the rooms are small unless you upgrade, and often on a dark side with little sunshine. And don't expect hot running water for your shower if the hotel is very busy. I waited 15 minutes for warm water and gave up. But 2 days later when the crowds left, there was no problem.


Room Tip: Frankly, cough up the money for an upgrade.

"To tell the truth I am a bit fed up with this hotel. I visit Palmer House for an annual meeting every year in mid-April for the past ten years or so. Its lobby is one of the places that is most familiar to me. Palmer House is a huge hotel. It is great for conferences and meetings but I cannot say it is a great tourist hotel. Its conference center is a bit cluttered with too many small meeting rooms and narrow corridors. Navigating through the conference center is a little difficult for the uninitiated. That said, there are enough rooms for a conference that hosts over 5000 participants and hundreds of meetings over a week long conference. It is not fancy but functional.Hotel rooms are generally spacious and service is your typical Hilton."
"This is such a great hotel; the character and charm are what make it unique. Close to transportation, shopping, restaurants and the theater. The rooms are spacious; bathroom was a bit smaller than expected but functional. Service at the desk is always top notch. The lobby bar provides a nice wind down area. If this area is busy they have a smaller bar that is less crowded. This hotel never disappoints."
A clean place to stay with comfortable furnishings and beautiful (although historic so somewhat older) decor/public furniture. The fitness center has both cardio and weight machines with a little room for those using mats. Internet access is not free but rooms have both wi-fi and wire connections available. The best part of this hotel is the glamorous lobby and fantastic location. Minutes from anything you could want or need (including a few vegan/vegan-friendly restaurants).
"I stay at Hilton hotels a lot for work but this was the first time at a re-purposed building, and I have to say it looked quite attractive... so down to business.The Rooms:Nice and compact for a hotel room. Not the biggest room I ever had but it was enough for me, I was there for business so most of the time I was only there to sleep and go to the office as soon as I wake up. There was no mini fridge in the room which was a let down but to be fair I never researched to make sure one was available before booking the room. There is a area with a desk and a chair for those who want to work from the hotel or just browse the web. The room I stayed in had some wallpaper that was peeling off but that does not bug me.The Staff:Check in was very quick since I pre-selected the room so all I had to do is pick up the keys and go to my room. Staff was friendly and efficient, not much to say there. Pretty much what I expected I received.The Property:Pretty much in the heart of downtown, plenty of places in walking distance for eating, drinking or shopping. Valet parking only here so be ready for that.Amenities:There was a gym and pool on site which is awesome as well as the usual things hotels provide (room service, dry cleaning, etc). On the first floor there is a nice area with bars and restaurants and is very homey but it always seemed busy. I myself prefer the hole in the wall places for eating and drinking.Connectivity:I received free WiFi since I am a HHonors member but I believe you have to pay to get it in this property. There is also wired connection on the desk if you like that better.Some things to improve:Overall the valet was spot on with their time estimates to get my car. On the last day for some reason when I was heading to the airport it took 40 minutes to get my car from valet... I am sure this was a fluke but plan ahead if you are like me and like to leave for the airport not too early.Conclusion:I would totally stay here again, no question.


Room Tip: Choose a room that faces away from the train tracks... it got quite loud when the trans passed.

"In town for the NRA restaurant show and stayed at the Palmer House. Picture perfect hotel! I will definitely be back! This hotel is an elegant throw back to the hay days of Chicago in the early 20th century. Lovely architecture. It is so well maintained, a jewel. The lobby bar is not to be missed. Potter is also great place to have a cocktail or glass of wine during a city walk or before heading out to dinner. Our room had 2 beds and 2 full baths, making it perfect for me and my traveling companion.

"PAST GLORIESThis hotel is a landmark. As far as Chicago is concerned, it has been there forever. The passport control officer at the airport during his checks asked where we were staying. He made the comment that the hotel was the centre of wheeler dealing and conferences within the city.We arrived at the hotel quite late at night and were greeted at the entrance by one of their valets / doorman by name. It appears these guys check who is arriving and at what time, now thats a greeting.The hotel is big. To get to reception you need to walk through the lower level shopping mall to the elevator (lifts) to the lobby. The lobby is a grand affair of marble and polished brass. Adjacent to the lobby is what can only be described as the Grand Hall; and it is grand. Columns, marble, floral displays and a high high painted ceiling. It is impressive now, customers must have been gobsmacked when the hotel was built over 100 years ago.After we were efficiently booked in, we made our way to our room on the 8th floor. Now we had been warned by a family member that the ""Loop"" train passes alongside the hotel and to check that the room wasn't that side of the building. They did not warn us about what we experienced. The room was large, and relatively modern, but dated version of art decor (black painted, not lacqued furniture). There were windows, there were blinds and curtains; there was just no view...just a brick wall ! A small, but adequate bathroom and no tea or coffee making facilities. We initially agreed that the room was ok as we were only staying 5 nights. We had a good night sleep, so the beds and linen were decent. We just could not stay in a room with no natural light. So we checked with reception for availability for a paid upgrade. So for our second and subsequent nights we slept in our upgraded room on the 23rd floor. We were lucky, we made our enquiry on a Thursday when most conferences and meetings were ending and rooms were becoming available. Again no view, but it did have natural light and access to Executive lounge (mentioned later). The room was again a nice size, with two bathrooms (handy for couples), but smaller than the one on the 8th floor. Again, for all nights we had a decent sleep.HOTEL CATERINGWe arrived late on our first night and tired from our Trans-Atlantic flight so we had our first experience of hotel food in Potters Bar. Potters Bar is named after the hotels founder Potter Palmer. It is a small bar off of the lobby. Wood panelled and dimly lit, the bar is used by conference delegates and business men finalising a deal. The bars menu consists of basic burger, fried chicken and pizza fayre, but all is well cooked, tasty and served fast. They also have a pretty fine liquor menu and I can personally recommend their India Pale Ale !Lockwood Restaurant - a brightly lit modern style restaurant off of the Grand Hall. Its decor is completely out of keeping with the rest of the ornate lobby area.We arrived at the restaurant for breakfast at 8.30am and had to wait nearly 30 minutes for a table for two. The reason for the wait is the restaurant size is totally inadequate for the size of the hotel and they allow guests to hold business meetings at tables whilst other guests wait. If this wait wasn't insult enough the buffet breakfast was the worst I have ever experienced in any hotel in any country. It had either been cooked poorly or had not been managed correctly whilst on the hot counter. After eating a few bites we both left the ""cooked"" food and resorted to bread ,jam and pastries.The place was hardly a relaxing environment, these business people not only hogged tables for their meeting, they did not talk at a reasonable level, all they did was shout.Executive Lounge - after our experience with the Lockwood Restaurant we were pleased that we had access to the lounge for breakfast, for the most part. They had a very good selection of cold meats,loads of boiled eggs, breakfast cereals, oatmeal / porridge, breads, fresh cooked pastries and fresh fruit. For most days the lounge was kept well stocked for breakfast, but it seems they started to experience interloppers. It appears some people from the non-exec floors had managed for find their way onto the lounge floor and had gone through the food like ""locusts"". When we arrived a member of staff were busily replenishing the stocks whilst another was checking every guest key card for their entitlement.Things were okay over the weekend, then on Monday the business people returned and hogged the tables in the lounge. Not only that, they stole chairs from other tables, leaving other guests to carry chairs from one end of the lounge to another to make up a ""working"" table to dine at.I have marked the service as average, but this does not reflect the high level of service in Potters Bar and the Executive Lounge. Sadly it was Lockwoods that dropped the overall score.SecurityThe hotel is situated within the ""Loop District"", the area encompassed by the elevated railway. A family member recommended this hotel, with the caveate that the loop area had a reputation for street crime (this was declared in a science conference info pack they had received). We did not experience any problems during our stay, but that can possibly attributed to the burly Bouncers / Security guards that appeared on the Mall entrance doors after dark.The lower floors have no security other than the security staff previouly mentioned and and can be accessed from street level. The exec floor lifts require a key card for them to work.Summary : The lobby and Grand Hall are impressive and worth a look whilst sightseeing the city. As for the rooms, they are well maintained, comfortable but dated. The staff (excluding the Lockwood) provided excellent service.The corridor on the 8th floor had black and white photographs of past celebrity guests (Frank Sinatra, Eartha Kitt etc). That kind of says it all. The hotel is a landmark living off of its past.We slept well, but would we stay again ? No, the place is too much hassle for a vacation.


Room Tip: Go for floors above 12 and ask for side of building away from elevated trains.

A great place to have a cocktail or glass of wine during a city walk or before heading out to dinner. Some rooms have 2 beds and 2 full baths, making them very comfy for a group of family. I've stayed here dozens of times for business and fun and never been disappointed."
"Nothing negative to say about our 5 day stay in the Palmer House Hotel. Decor was amazing, like stepping back in time. Our room was spacious and spotlessly clean as was the rest of the hotel. Lobby area was breathtakingly beautiful. Every member of staff that we encountered were way beyond helpful. Special mention to Tatiyana the lady that checked us in, her warmth and genuine interest in us really shone through. Would come back to this hotel in a heartbeat."
"I've stayed in the Palmer House several times this year and it was ok. This time the room seemed incomplete- no refrigerator and no glasses or cups in the bathroom. Also, no coffee cups or packets. From the first we had problems with the sink draining. The water just sat there. I guess we weren't that surprised when the toilet stopped working. The desk didn't seem to be that surprised or concerned when we reported it. I've had better service a Holiday Inn. Not what we expected."
"Aside from a great location, the staff at this hotel has been trained to please their customers in every way. They are very friendly, eager to help and assist in any possible way. Congratulations to the Hotel Manager, great job!! The entire hotel is a grand dame, kept in very good condition. The food at the lobby restaurant was great, very creative, unusual ingredients. My birthday celebration was made more memorable by the hospitality of the staff.

The camera was small but exquisitely furnished in a modern 1930 look.Huge building, shops inside, very well connected to touristical areas, in the middle of the Chicago ""loop"". Service could have been a bit more client oriented, especially for a quasi gold member, but perhaps too many guestsIt is the first hilton related hotel with a very low noise coming with the HVAC"
"I was absolutely astonished when I walked into the lobby of the Palmer House. It is really a throwback to the grand hotels of the 19th century, which of course it is. I haven't stayed in such a hotel, truly dripping with character, in close to 20 years. The remarkable thing is that the room rate was quite reasonable. Should it be available for that again I would stay there every time.The room is a bit dated, in the sense that the bathroom is very narrow by modern standards, but the sleeping area was quite spacious and modern. In all, a gem!"
"This hotel has character with all the modern upgrades expected in today's extravagant hotels. You're greeted with a grand lobby and bar area when you enter the hotel. The Executive level offers a very tasteful breakfast and hot Hors d'oeuvres in the evening. The service was excellent with Ernest Fizer (Executive Level Attendant) making sure you find a table and all your needs are met. The Hotel is close to some great restaurants (RPM, etc.) and the Art Institute of Chicago.


Room Tip: Upgrade to the Executive level as it is well worth the minor upcharge.

"Honestly the location was good, but there are cheaper hotels in the same location - use one of those. If you want to throw money away for the sake of being ""fancy"" this is all yours. It is a very interesting building with a lot of history, but experiencing it while staying elsewhere is your best bet. Swing by check out the lobby and the special rooms or take a tour but don't overpay for a nights stay."
"As a Hilton Diamond member, I've been generally disappointed in the quality of Hilton hotels in the U.S., compared to Europe. Not so with the Palmer House Hilton. It has a stunning lobby worthy of Chicago's art deco heritage. And my room had a view of the Chicago skyline, and was very attractive and very well maintained. It was Easter Sunday, the afternoon I arrived, but the Executive Lounge remained open. It served up a decent Easter ham dinner to guests. Breakfasts in the lounge also were quite good. The hotel is well located, just a couple of blocks from The Art Institute of Chicago. One note of caution: Unlike executive lounges abroad, this Hilton charges for alcoholic drinks."
"Was in Chicago this past week for a business trip. Palmer House is at a convenient location, short walk to Millenium Park. Although it is an old hotel it has retained much character. Rooms don't have the usual amenities like tea / coffee making facilities but the rooms are spacious and well kept. One additional comment is the executive level attendant, Ernest Fizer, who is so proactively helpful and genuinely cheerful he literally puts a smile on your face every morning. Really lifts your mood."
"I stayed at the Palmer House Hilton for a conference, which was held at the hotel. Overall, the hotel was stately and luxurious. Check in was fast. My room was small but comfortable - although it did not have much of a view. I liked the character and style of the hotel. I love the large elevator banks with the couches in the middle. The only issue I had was that my room was next to a suite in which a group of teenagers/young women were staying. They returned to their room at 3 AM and were extremely loud for over an hour. I had to call security several times. This was an unfortunate experience; however, I was happy that the hotel took my concern seriously and was able to quiet them. Overall, I had a positive experience at this hotel and would recommend it."
"We reserved a room for a theatre weekend. Arrived at the hotel at 3 pm, when we were told our room would be ready. We were told it was not ready yet but that we could on the 23rd floor lounge, which was the floor our room would be on. The desk clerk took my cell phone number, gave us keys to our room, and said he would call shortly and provide the room number. An hour later I returned to the front desk and inquired about the room. The same clerk apologized and said he would go back and talk to the Housekeeping manager. He returned and offered a room on another floor, significantly diminished from the one we reserved. On arrival to the new floor we were met by a member of housekeeping as we alighted the elevator, she offered to help us find our room. We gave her the number and she said that she could have guessed it as it was the only cleaned room on the floor. Not the Palmer House we expected after years of stays."
"This iconic hotel was our staging point for a food and fun filled getaway. The hotel itself is a spectacular piece from the past, replete with an ambiance of the performers and personalities which have graced her over the years. Photos adorn the walls of those that took the stage in one of the seven ballrooms, trivia abounds such as this being the birthplace of the brownie, the first hotel with electric lights and telephones installed in guest rooms, etc. With over 1600 rooms and consuming nearly a full block, it was a fun place to stay.

"Recent stay at the the beautiful and historic Palmer House Hilton in Chicago nice but room left a bit to be improved. Took the train in which stops practically at the Palmer House doors. This puts your into the lower level. No doormen at this entrance. In fact, did not see a doorman at the main entrance either. As this hotel is always busy, it was a bit confusing to find the real lobby. There was a long line at check in but the HH line was empty. Quick check in, no upgrades or access to Executive lounge was given but I was given 2 bottles of water. Found the elevators (again confusing as some go to certain floors but not others). Then multiple turns to my room. It was a small queen bed room. Clean, average bed, small bath, 2 closets which I did not see until the next day. I went to plug my phone in to charge and this area needs some work. None of the outlets on the lamps worked. The outlets in the bathroom were so bad the cords would not even stay in. I finally found a plug in behind the nightstand that actually worked. Needless to say by this point my phone was nearly dead and I had an event to go to. The lobby bar nice but super busy on this night. Very limited bar menu. Room service ends at 11:30 pm so plan ahead if you need a late dinner or snack. I was told that this is a location that will be ending room service all together. Very sad to see room service going at the full service hotels. Lots of cold grab and go dinners in my future. But I digress. I had late night drink at the bar and off the limited menu ordered a pizza. My drink vodka and cranberry was very bad. Not sure how that can be messed up but it was taken care of. The pizza was average but at least food. Left early the next am so no other meals there.There is a CVS right across the street from the location which is good if you forgot any items."
The building is absolutely beautiful and I am certain there is some history here. I did not have a lot of time to research the history or explore the architecture. I ordered room service one night but did not eat in either of the restaurants. The food was delivered very quickly and the soup was hot - the way I like it. The gym was big but still very crowded in the morning. The location is great - right off of State Street. I did not give it five stars because there were a couple of hairs on the bathroom floor.
"The hotel shined in its great workout facility. I haven't seen a better more engaging workout space at a hotel before. Tons of machines, weights, and natural light. I kept thinking I wish I got to workout here each day. The breakfast buffet was really nice as well. The walls were very thin. I stayed there on St. Patricks day and could easily hear the neighbors. Overall a good stay in a nice location. I stayed here for business and hosted a speaker on site. The catering staff was excellent. They walked me through the entire process because I wasn't able to come look at the space prior to the event. So some really great pieces at this beautiful hotel."
"Beautiful hotel in a fantastic location in Chicago's Loop.The Lockwood bar sets in the stunning Main Lobby. The Bar Staff was very impressive and informative. Melayna was our favorite bartender. You have to experience the homemade Bloody Marys!The Executive Level amenities were very adequate and the service great. Ernest was the most friendly and helpful Attendant we met.The whole Staff, from top to bottom were very friendly, helpful and engaging.We had a fantastic stay."
"I've stayed many times over many years, and it's always a top notch hotel. The lobby is elegant, grand, and with a hint of nostalgia. Many sitting areas abound if you are going to meet with someone. I was also in hors-d'oeuvre bar on the main floor with my daughter. Wonderful ambiance and a small trio playing soft, bossa nova type music. The room is certainly acceptable, and the bed was comfy. Right outside the door is your mass transit red line train going north-south."
"The hotel is a ""grand dame"" similar to other classic beauties such as the Waldorf Astoria. As others have stated, yes, the rooms are small - but remember it is a historic hotel. The baths are modern with newer fixtures and marble tiles. The rooms vary in size - My recommendation is to take advantage of the Hilton app and choose your room. That way you can select a larger room. The rooms do come with king beds. My room is appointed with desk, chair, flat panel TV, mini frig, and small closet. I chose a room that had a window on the inner courtyard - which is very quiet.There is a Starbucks in the lobby and several restaurants in hotel as well as nearby. I would stay here again. Paul Mitchell products in bath.


Room Tip: Corner rooms are largest and those on inner courtyard the quietest.

Green Features: Typical Hilton eco-friendly practices. The towels are only freshened if you ask (you have choice - leave on towel bar or hang on hook if you don't want replaced). There are new rain shower heads. Linens are changed every 3 days."
"I've stayed here several times before, but not again. I was rudely awakened by a roach crawling on my foot in the bathroom. Hotel staff were not accommodating, did not offer anything other than to change rooms -- and even that took effort. For a jewel hotel in downtown Chicago, I expected way better service. Completely disappointed with their lack of response after discovering the roaches in my room. I' m not sure how you'd expect your patrons to sleep after finding large roaches in their rooms, I certainly didn't sleep well after this."
"I decided to try Priceline for the first time and ended up with the Palmer House. I was not excited about that result, but the stay was better than I expected. They typically cannot touch a Priceline reservation but accommodated my room request in advance nonetheless. Also, during our stay they did not treat us differently just because we booked with Priceline (I had heard many bad stories about that in general). Although the hotel is old (it's an historical place), it was super clean. Location is perfect; we walked to the Pier, and the Art Institute and Millennium Park are only about a block away."
"Let me start by saying the location is fantastic and the hotel lobby is a tourist attraction in it of itself. The reception desk was friendly and check in was quick and easy. I particularly like that the elevators are labeled by floor, so there was really no wait for an elevator throughout my stay. The bar in the hotel was very nice and offered excellent original drinks. It was a nice way to spend the evening before heading up to my room.This is now where my review takes a turn. The hallways are old and narrow and you will feel like you are in the 1920's, which would not be bad, except the fact that it is actually 2015, and the style would work well if it was updated with a 1920's flair, but not actually 1920's. My room was tiny. When I say tiny, it basically just fit the bed and a nightstand. The bathroom was very basic with a small pedestal sink, with old worn down fixtures. Carpeting was old and worn as well. The bed sagged, but the linens were very comfortable. My guest is they have not renovated in a long time, and as you know hotel mattresses are not made for many years of abuse. It was nice to have the comfortable sheets.If I were to head back to Chicago I would choose a different hotel. It was certainly nice enough to to make a point of interest on a tour of Chicago, but certainly no experience that lies beyond the lobby and restaurant floors.


Green Features: They will only change towels if you place towels on floor or in tub."
"I booked three rooms at this hotel for a Saturday overnight with my children and a visiting friend. I had a reservation for 2 Two bed and bath room on the executive level and a single room on non executive level. Checking in was informed only one exec room available and nothing adjoining. Children and parents would be divided by different levels with different lift access and no apologies offered. None of the complimentary hilton honors facilities offered and only informed about room coffee/Tea facility etc.. at check out. Was not until Breakfast on following morning that we encountered our first helpful and pleasant staff member. All other at Reception, Concierge, Bell and Lounge were abrupt and unhelpful to the point of rudeness. The hotel was busy with a conference and clearly a traveling family group was just another irritation. For the cost rooms are small with tiny bathrooms and no inform services unless you ask. Will not return and will use Conrad two blocks up where I have never had any complaints."
"This hotel is great as long as you don't leave. Seriously, every time I walked out within a half a block I was plagued by no less than 5 panhandlers. ALL extremely aggressive. Talking to me, yelling while I was on the phone, repeatedly harassing you coming in and out of stores. Shame that chicago's leadership has let it get like this. Ii have a feeling that any hotel in this area will have the same issues. I never had this problem in New York, Miami, San fran, etc...Chicago is unpleasant to walk anywhere because of this.


Room Tip: Many rooms are quite small, I got lucky with extra space.

"This is my second review of Palmer House..following several years. I visit Chicago for an annual conference and have a choice of hotels up and down MI Ave. This year went back to Palmer House's Executive Level and continue to be ""in love"" with this classic hotel.The Executive Level (floors 24 and up) offers am breakfast, pm snacks/ beverages, and separate elevators. The lobby is like none other: recently restored painted cathedral ceilings, golden wall sconces, open side bar, and cozy chair groupings that offer more intimate seatings. The lobby offers a great after-work, after-meeting, after-touring place to relax . Rooms are comfortable..but can run smaller-depending which floor/arrangement. Our quiet room faced the inside courtyard-so little outside noise. Long corridors with labyrinth like room numbering seem confusing at first. But you can enjoy the unique b&w photos along the corridors on your way to the room. Our package included free in-room wifi, (normally ""extra""). As an historic restored property, you will undoubtedly discover unique features&qualities not found in the modern, minimalist style hotels.


Room Tip: Courtyard facing rooms quieter. Executive Level ++

"We spent a week at The Palmer House in March for a conference - kids came with as it was March Break. It was a great week. We were on the 15th floor with an inside room with an atrium view. We had two double beds and one bathroom - there are rooms with two bathrooms that would have been awesome with the kids, but not in the conference budget. The room was very spacious, though only had one arm chair and one desk chair. It would have been great to have another arm chair or a love seat as there was plenty of room for either. We have stayed here before, though not with the kids when they were old enough to remember. They loved the historic property and the beautiful elegance of this hotel. It was also fun for all of us to read the trivia questions in the elevators. The kids also loved the pool - there were many visits to the pool and the hot tub which was never too crowded and very well maintained. We had breakfast daily at Lockwoods and it was excellent - some days we had the continental buffet and other days the hot buffet, but it was always excellent and the service was also very attentive. We had a small issue with noisy neighbours - others had the same issue with the same folks and security dealt with it reasonably well. This is such a great location - right between the loop trains and the red line and only another block to the blue line - you can access the entire city from here and not have to get lost trying. We had easy access to the buses on State Street and so many good restaurants in easy walking access. Kids loved that Corner Bakery is right next door and easily accessible for a quick snack. Also, great access to excellent shopping - DSW, Ulta, Nordstrom Rack, Macy's and so many more all within a few blocks and easy walking. Very close to the Art Institute (2 blocks) and easy access to other big attractions like the Field Museum, Soldier Field and all the other goodies at the museum campus. Loved it and can't wait to go back!


Room Tip: ask for an outside room with a view - we weren't in the room enough for it to matter and the kid...

"This hotel is in the heart of downtown Chicago and the moment you walk in, you feel like you've stepped into a part of Chicago's history. It's a beautiful hotel with friendly staff. It seems to be a place where locals frequent to grab coffee and meet clients in the Lobby. Very impressed. Beds were comfortable and the room was clean and spacious. There is a pool and hot tub, though these didn't really seem to fit with the ambiance of the rest of the hotel. The hot tub was not quite hot enough, and seemed cheap and old, but other than that, I have no complaints about Palmer House. I highly recommend staying here."
"I get to Chicago regularly for business, and the Palmer House Hilton has become my hotel of choice, for multiple reasons.The lobby bar is a perfect place for people watching over a drink. The prices are a little high, but considering the hotel is located in the Loop, and the lobby is so grand with incredible ambiance, I really don't mind.The fitness center is quite extensive (although quite busy in the mornings) including plenty of cardio and free weights and steam rooms, pool, fitness studio, etc.There is a well-equipped Executive Lounge for premium members, and it offers complimentary breakfast in the morning (including hot foods) and appetizers/snacks (including hot appetizers) in the evening. It's also available during the day to grab a soda or light snacks.The Executive Floors have a private elevator which makes it easy to access those limited floors. One warning - the elevators can be quite busy and slow at times.The rooms have character and aren't cookie-cutter Hilton rooms. Some of them are incredibly large. Others are more modest but still retain their charm. Note: The rooms do not come with coffee makers standard, but a quick call to guest services rectifies that oversight. (I'm not sure why they don't just have them in the rooms.)So, yes, there are minor inconveniences (mainly the slow elevators), but the hotel's charm, elegance, and facilities more than make up for these."
"My best friend and I decided to take a short trip to Chicago last week. My job was getting tickets to the show we wanted to see, her's was getting a hotel. She couldn't have done a better job! The Palmer House Hilton was a block away from the theatre where we were seeing our show (Bank of American Theatre), and was in easy walking distance of great shopping eating, and The Art Institute. It's a beautiful hotel, with a very friendly staff. I love the room. It was a little ""old"", but that made me like it all the more. There was actually room in our room! We each had our own closet, and the bathroom, while small, was charming. The best was the sleep quality, however. The room was COMPLETELY DARK - we loved it. No blinking or shining lights on the ceiling, no gaps in the curtains. It was also very quiet. I can't wait to return to this hotel for another fun stay."
"The coolest space of the hotel is its ""magnificent"" lobby, the worst its thin walls. More or less you can hear every single speech within 30 meters from your room, and obviously during my stay there were lots of students in my (+below+upper) floor. In any case I was not in Chicago for sleeping all day long...then I could cohabit with this. For what it may concern my room it was OK (even if the bathroom is a little bit small). The bed was comfortable and the cleaning service sufficiently careful. I give to this structure 4 point because of its position is extraordinary, near the Art Institute, and Chicago Symphony and 10 minutes walking from the magnificent mile. Good value for money even if it has not free wi-fi but in the area is quite standard I guess."
"We stayed here on a Thursday through Monday visit to Chicago. As Diamond level, we were upgraded at checkin to the executive floor and received bottled water. We stayed on the top floor with the executive lounge. They have an executive elevator to use.We were in room 244 and had a nice view, even though we were told the hotel does not have nice views. We overlooked the Trump Tower and could see Millennium Park through the buildings and a pick-a-boo view of the lake. The room was small and the bathroom was very small but nice. There was a walk in closet. The room was well appointed and in good repair for an old hotel. It were also very clean. My only complaint, this is a complaint with all Hiltons, the tv menu is slow and the tv signal is lost frequently. They do have HBOs which is a plus.The lounge had daily breakfast and nightly appetizers. We did not expect the appetizers on the weekend and were pleasantly surprised. They also had a coffee machine that produced latte, cappuccino, hot chocolate, ect. Along with the standard coffee, tea, soda. There was no bottled water in the lounge, instead the had a selection of plain and fruit infused water that was sufficient. There was also nuts, snacks, and fruit always available. The staff was very friendly. Everyone said hello to us and thanked us for staying. We came home late one night and knew the lounge would be closed so we asked at the front desk for water and the desk person gave us two bottles which we really appreciated. We asked the concierge for a recommendation for Easter brunch. They gave us a printed out list of suggestions in which we looked up and picked one to make a reservation to.The fitness center was nice. We used treadmills in the two story area with glass roof. There were chilled towels and headphones to use. The locker room had a steam room and the pool/ hot tub looked ok. However, we didn't use these.The location is very central. It is close to shopping on state street, theaters, the park, and a short walk to many restaurants. Easy to get a cab if you wanted or needed to.The lobby is magnificent. If you stay here make sure to look at the peacock doors, Romeo and Juliet statue and the mail shoots. Overall I loved this hotel and would stay here again when visiting Chicago."
"Really enjoyed our short stay at this hotel! It was our first time to Chicago and we went only for fun. We really appreciated the close proximity to everything downtown and easy access to local transportation! Hotel was gorgeous and really well updated for over 100 years old. The rate was very comparable to other hotels, although we booked through Priceline. Room was clean and we were even upgraded from a Double Bed to a King Bed when we arrived! Check-in was really busy, but understandable at 5pm. Check-out process was extremely easy over the phone through their ""zip-out"" checkout! Our only complaint was the guest in the room next to us, who blared the TV and radio at all hours. The walls were thin, but understandable in an old hotel."
"The Palmer house is an excellent old hotel in the loop section of Chicago. It's location on Monroe is a couple of blocks from S Michigan Ave, several blocks from the river in either direction. It is also a block away from the Blue Line ( to O'Hare) and 2 blocks to the Red Line on State St. Very convenient for downtown activities, but I prefer to stay north of the river, not much going on at night. The main floor is the second floor, which has a huge lobby bar, and a beautiful ceiling. Check in & out was simple. They treat Diamond customers very well. Was able to get a 3PM checkout. Exec lounge is better than most other Hilton's where I have stayed. Adequate breakfast. My room was very good size. Bathroom was on the small side, but nice shower heads! Overall, an excellent stay for a business trip, would definitely stay here again."
"The Hilton Palmer House offers a clean comfortable room with welcoming staff. Bedding was originally down-filled but was quickly changed upon request due to my allergies. They had a full fitness center with a full assortment of aerobics equipment, exercise machines, and free weights. You will be able to keep up your exercise program here for sure. It is also located just a few blocks from Millennium park and Michigan Ave. so it is a great home base to see the loop."
"My husband and I stayed at the Palmer House recently to celebrate my 50th birthday. We had stayed there before several years ago and found it lovely and extremely convenient to many downtown Chicago attractions. We both love grand old historic hotels, and this is definitely one of them. For the recent trip we made a reservation for a king room about three weeks before the visit through the hotel's web site. We checked in at about 1 pm (well before check-in time was supposed to even begin) and were told that no king rooms were available. We were initially told that only a double room was available. I showed the receptionist the reservation confirmation information that I had printed out. It said: Hip and Historic King, Nonsmoking confirmedShe said that the ""confirmed"" only referred to the ""nonsmoking"" part. She said she could give us a queen room. I was very disappointed with the room we ended up with; it was very small, had a view of a wall and received no daylight at all, and the bed was not what we had requested and was not that comfortable. And it was next to the service elevator.I called the front desk and asked if there was any way we could switch to a king sized room; we would be willing to pay more for it, as this was a very special occasion for us. They said they could not do that, but did take off $25 from the room rate and gave us vouchers for free breakfasts at the hotel the next morning. So I have mixed feelings. I still remember the feeling of wanting to cry when I saw the room. The room we had on our previous visit had been so much nicer, and it would have meant so much to me to have had a decent room for this special occasion. They did try to make some amends, but ultimately, what I will always remember now about that hotel was the dark tiny room and smaller than requested bed and not the free breakfast or the discount on the room.


Room Tip: I have no advice, except be prepared NOT to get the room you expected when you made the reservation.

"this is a very historic hotel with a beautiful lobby. And the meeting rooms are very large and pleasing to the eye. While I would stay here again because of the central location and proximity to the ""L."" I would like to warn everyone to things that I will be aware of next time.- Early arrival charge-$25 which I was not prepared for, but needed to get into my room to get ready for meeting.- If you are given a room on the 8th floor, be sure to ask if your room backs up to the pool. My room did, and I was not told, and when I looked out the translucent window, I realized I backed up to the indoor pool. Which by not having a window made me feel as if I was in a jail cell.My air conditioner in the room was not good. It was comfortable but not able to cool it down. And my shower had some issues along with the door.One good thing I can say is that the workout center is one of the nicest I have ever seen in a hotel.I would maybe stay here again, but I will ask many more questions. To say I am disappointed would be correct."
"On entering the hotel, we were very impressed with the opulent lobby. Our room could have done with a bit of updating & bathroom small. However, the location of the hotel is just great for reaching Chicago's main attractions. A lovely little cafe for breakfast a few doors down, considerably cheaper than in hotel. Although the train line passes the door, our room wasn't noisy. A comfortable stay."
"Upon entering the property it oozed luxury ... deep, richly colored carpeting and marble floors, beautiful central sitting and bar area with extremely high and decorated ceilings and walls, professional looking registration area, and a bank of opulent but old style elevators. We had a 2 double bed room on 20th floor (if I recall) that was HUGE. You could literally have added 2 more double beds to the room. Had not one, bt TWO walk in closets, a dresser drawer set, and a work desk. Decor wasn't particularly special, except for some antique fixtures that you may consider either charming or just old (depending on your taste). Only odd part was that the beds were just doubles and there was clearly enough room for Queen sized, or even King! Oh, and the bathroom, by comparison, was quite small. Given that the only sink was inside the bathroom, it did cause a challenge for more than one person getting ready in the morning. Location was real highlight as it is within walking distance to the Art Institute, The Bean, and local parks. Can also walk the loop. Even if you prefer to take a taxi instead of walking to further out areas, the cost is reasonable given the central location.Cost was on par or better with what I would expect (mid $200s/night) for the area. So I would consider this a good value and would stay here again."
"Few places can offer the same historic luxury as Chicago's Palmer House. My husband and I have stayed here many times, and always have wonderful experiences. The lobby is truly stunning, and home to a fabulous bar perfect for people watching. Bar service can be a bit slow on a busy night, but the bartenders are always courteous and helpful. The bar menu has a lovely selection of cocktails and appetizers, too: The Manhattans are mixed quite well, and we have always had well-prepared food. Rooms at the Palmer House are decorated in lovely Art Deco style and the bathrooms have the best lighting in all of Chicago (I dislike a dim bathroom). I do, on occasion, feel as though I need to leave a trail of breadcrumbs from the elevator to the room. The long, winding hallways tend to look the same and the room numbering can be a bit confusing. Still, every area of this hotel maintains a classic, luxe feel to create a wonderful atmosphere. Housekeeping is excellent and staff has always been extremely pleasant. On our most recent trip, the staff member even waived the early check-in fee for us, which we truly appreciated. One suggestion to the hotel: We'd certainly appreciate the addition of bottled water (for purchase) in the rooms. No one wants to hunt down a vending machine at 2am."
"The best bit is the arrival. Ascending the escalator it's hard not to miss the striking ornate ceiling and the accompanying fixtures and fittings in the bar/lobby/restaurant area. The hotel smacks of history, but as you join the queue to register the warning bells ring indicating that it is just a bed factory.The buffet breakfast was good with a vast range of quality products. But, inevitably choose your time to avoid the queue. After the first day I chose to eat in the many eateries round and about.The room was clean, reasonably sized but with a small bathroom. The room overlooked the inner courtyard and was quiet. Part of the hotel has the overground railway running past it, so beware. There are no coffee facilities in the room, but there is a Starbucks on site. The place oozes security, even the chambermaids check your key.. but it the way that it was initially done, that for me, is questionable. I would have expected, at least some explanation, rather than barking instructions in broken English.Checkout is early, 11am. I've seen the architecture, so next time I would choose to stay somewhere more personable and welcoming."
"We stay at the Palmer House frequently. It is a beautiful hotel and Christmastime is one of the best times of all. The hotel is a Chicago icon but even though it is old, I have always been happy with the rooms. Our favorite is when we have stayed in a double room with two double beds and two bathrooms. It is such a treat to have the two bathrooms! I also enjoy having a drink in the lobby bar and watching the people. My only negative comment is that if you stay here as part of a convention, they don't seem to be able to handle the check in process with a full house. Lines are long and rooms aren't ready until evening. They do have a wonderful bell staff that does it's best to help with anything they can. I truly love staying at this hotel. The location for the loop is wonderful. It is easy to take the subway, a bus, or the El from this location. It is also a great location for attending a play."
"I was looking forward to staying at the Palmer House for a number of reasons. When I got there early they let me check-in early, but the only room available was a handicap accessible one. I asked whether they should save it for someone who needed it and they said they had many rooms that were accessible. They told me at the desk it was actually a larger room and I specifically asked about the bathroom. Well, it turned out to be a square room without much to it, a closet with a very low clothes bar, and the bathroom was a large room with a drain in the middle, a very narrow shower with a shower that was ridiculous for anyone who wanted to stand up and shower, no soap holder or other shelf type accessory. The handles to the shower were very stiff and hard to regulate the temp. The sink/vanity was set up for a wheelchair, but the sink was so far back that even standing it was a stretch to reach the handles of the sink. The lamps had to be moved to turn out from the bed and it was really a pretty stupidly set up room. I asked many of my convention attendees about their rooms and viewed several, and this was not worth the cost, but the others were nice for an older historical hotel. The lobby is spectacular, and the bell staff most friendly. The desk folks simply couldn't find another room for me to move to when I asked to be move immediately after being placed in this room. No coffee in room and the Starbucks was super slow and always had a huge line even at 7 in the morning! I was disappointed with my stay, but think in general it was a nice place for others.

"We stayed there for the night before the Shamrock Shuffle. Self park is just down the street on E. Monroe and is very convenient. You can have your ticket validated when you check in and get unlimited in/out during your stay. The room was very well appointed, including a desk and over stuffed chair. The bathroom was well updated. Our room neighbor left their TV on when they left and you could hear it in out room. We could also hear their conversation at times. This was an adjoining room so it might have been coming thru the door vs the wall. On our next visit i will certainly try and get a room without adjoining doors. Our room faced out on state street, we were high enough not to have to worry about the office across the street; although the window treatments were very good for pivacy as well as letting light into the room. The lobby/lounge was very nice; not overcrowded. There was a reception on the mezzanine level while we were there which added character to the nite. If you are going to Chicago and want to stay within close walking distance to the Buckingham Fountain, this hotel is certainly a good choice.


Room Tip: Check if the room is adjoining, maybe steer clear; our room - the noise carried thru from our neighb...

"The Palmer House is in an excellent location in downtown Chicago with easy access to the rest of the city. You can access Monroe, Wabash or State from the street level lobby. They will get you a cab or limo stress free. The staff is friendly, not intrusive and very helpful. It is older but clean and comfortable with class. There are several places to eat and shop within walking distance. If you want to experience Chicago then this is an excellent place to stay and launch from each day."
"My husband and I decided to stay 1 night at this hotel. We were not impressed with the services. Check in was okay agent didn't seem interested that we were checking in. Had to figure out were the elevator was and then there was kids all over blocking the hallways. No coffee maker in the room, very surprised because of all the hotels I stayed I always had a coffee maker or tea bags in the room. The server sent one up but the plug next to the tv was not working had to plug it by the desk. Room decor was okay room felt very small and bathroom was tiny. I didn't feel welcomed staying here it felt like an average stay. My husband and I had a few drinks at the lobby bar and ordered an appetizer was charged but never received the appetizer. Waiter seemed in a hurry did apologized but we were ready to leave and have dinner else where. I believe the Palmer house came in short and probably not my favorite place to stay."
"The lobby is very stately, but not ostentatious. We enjoyed relaxing, and drinking the lemon water while waiting for our check in. The exercise facilities are really good. In addition to the usual treadmills and stationary bikes, they also had a good selection of free weights and machines, as well as a pool, hot tub, and steam room.  We had breakfast at their restaurant, the Lockwood. The buffet was fresh and had a great selection of food, and the servers were attentive.  The hotel is within easy walking distance of Magnificent Mile, Millennium Park, and several good restaurants. The Palmer House is a credit to the Hilton Brand and to the city of Chicago."
"The hotel, the room decor and the ambiance are second to none. However . . . my wife and I booked a King Suite which comes with a wet bar. Unfortunately, the wet bar is virtually useless unless you have your room catered to by the hotel. There were no glasses, no plates, no utensils -- nothing except a small refrigerator (and no minibar). There was not even a coffee maker. I get that the hotel wants you to use room service, but not even a coffee maker? I expect more from a luxury hotel suite."
"This is my third trip to Chicago for the America's Beauty Show and I have stayed at other hotels in Chicago on previous trips but the Palmer House Hilton to me is the best! The location is great to navigate the city! From midway you can take the Orange line to Adams/Wabash and you are right there at the entrance of the hotel! The Art Institute is a block and a half away, the bean is close by, so is the magnificent mile as well as the red line for the subway is just steps away from the entrance on State, this hotel is fabulous! The hotel itself is gorgeous, the beds are comfy and so are the pillows, there's lots of shops, conveniences like a Starbucks and a gorgeous lounge and dining room, make sure you look up and appreciate the ceiling!The hotel has everything, the staff is top notch! One in particular that stands out is DJ the doormen that had recommended places to eat, things to do and always greeted us with a smile and willingness to help us find our way around the city! Did I mention he suggested the best tiramisu I've ever had in my life!!! I leave Chicago tomorrow (March 23, 2015) and I'm already starting to plan my next trip back to explore this city even more!!!P.s. If you see DJ (you can't miss him he's tall, with a great smile and broad shouldered) ask him for tips about the city, you won't be disappointed!!!!"
"Such a beautiful hotel! Even as a a Diamond member, I was totally impressed! Beautifully updated and close to museums. We wanted to see if we could figure out how to get from Midway to hotel on the train vs cab simply as an adventure or challenge. So much for the challenge....every time we stopped to study a map, a helpful and friendly local would volunteer info! What a wonderful city!It was an easy ride on the Orange line to Adams/Wabash. The hardest part was actually finding the lobby to hotel. It's hidden among shops without an obvious sign. The lobby is on the second floor. We had reserved with points, and although I had a confirmation number, my reservation wasn't confirmed with the hotel. We had dinner reservations in just a couple of hours, so we almost began to panic, but the front desk clerk was very reassuring that all would work out. They upgraded us to executive floor which included free breakfast and all day snacks. We were on the TOP floor, which could have been amazing, but with a courtyard view, it means we simply looked across at the other rooms on the 23rd floor. Not that we we weren't grateful....just saying if you request a high floor, be sure to request a city view. The rooms are historic, but beautifully updated. Housekeeping staff was efficient, polite and professional. Left the room sparkling clean without over spraying fragrance. So nice to return to a clean room!Had high tea at Lockwood in hotel. Look for review."
"Like so many other reviews, I arrived knowing I got a good deal and that the location is hard to beat. We were there for the last shopping weekend before Christmas and the energy and crowds didn't disappoint. With that said, the check in lines were extremely long when we got to the hotel. Lucky for us - and kudos to the staff - the Palmer provided lines for HiltonHonor members so we were treated to a quick check in. The hotel is amazing. Grand lobby, old wood finishes, decor that transports you back to another time. The room will do the same as it is old, small and ""historic"" - so code for a bit outdated but tolerable given your surroundings. The bath had everything you would want, the room was clean and there was plenty of water pressure (and hot water). The location was great. If you are willing to walk in the cold, stay here at Christmas time and you can easily walk to - Grant Park where you can ice skate, Michigan ave shopping, the German market in the plaza and all the food and drinking you can manage. Check out was as easy as check in and the nearby parking - which was a concern going in - was easily navigated and managed. We will stay here again..."
"Once you get past the fancy lobby everything falls apart. My room stank, I constantly heard the people in the next room having a normal conversation, and the bathroom was so small I could not turn around without hitting the wall. On top of it all I was staying here on Business and the hotel was part of the conference I was attending and they charged me $10 a day for internet. That is taking advantage of the customer. In this day and age you cannot do without it so you have no choice but to pay their price. I would not stay at this hotel again."
"My stay was a combination business/pleasure trip, and it hit the mark on both counts. I stayed on the Exec. Level floor which, for just a little more than standard rates, is a great deal. The Wifi is free and there is a breakfast, daytime snacks and soft drinks etc. all throughout the day. There are nice seating/meeting spaces there as well. The room was generously sized and comfortable. Housekeeping was a little slow, and there was no evening turn down service. The hotel lobby is quite spectacular, very old european style with a grand lobby and amazing ceiling painting. The hotel has a lot of history, since it is over 150 years old I'm told. All the staff were friendly and accomodating and, given the price, I found it to be a solid value. If you want something other than the many ""modern"" hotels with more hip euro-style furnishings and decor, but still centrally located in the loop, Palmer might be the place for you. It was for me and I would return there.

"I have stayed here three times and never been disappointed. Staff are courteous and helpful we always feel relaxed and comfortable. The rooms are spacious and clean. Great location for everything, tried the drake in September 2014 and staff unfriendly especially reception wouldn't go back there.I will be back in May this year and will look forward to my stay at Palmer House. Will always stay here if possible we visit Chicago usually once a year for last six years and hopefully will continue to do so for many years.I cannot recommend this hotel highly enough its always a pleasure.

The Palmer House Hotel is a true classic hotel. The location is ideal. The check in team was excellent. The rooms were clean and really good sized compared to say the Hilton Towers. Now the reason for only a 4 dot rating. The rooms are starting to show their age w wallpaper peeling off the walls in the room and bathroom. The rooms were quiet and comfortable. It was very easy to get cabs or uber. This hotel is right off an L stop. I can't comment on the restaurant because we didn't stay to eat there. Very nice hotel you will not be disappointed.
"On my second visit to this bueatiful city I couldn't have stayed in a better place. Centrally located, served by public transport, main attractions within a stones throw and surrounded by plenty of eateries/restaurants its heaven for a tourist on a short visitThe hotel has architecturally rewarding ornate main bar which can rival any grade I listed building in the UKThe rooms are spacious with good wifi connection, spa is well run, steam oozing hot and they even provide dispisable razors ...need I add any moreThoughly enjoyed the stay"

"The traditional jewels originating this incredible property are alive! Everything is simply new again with revitalized original decor and style along with legendary service at every step throughout! The property is breathtaking and the rooms totally revamped to offer the glory that other hotels can't even imagine no matter how hard they try (for example the Andaz...losers!) The location is unbeatably close to the mellinial park, museums and magnificent mile shopping. Doormen great you and taxis are never a wait. This service culture flows through the blood of this traditional facility. Even Mathew, in security, saved the trip by retrieving and shipping our left behind cell phone....and he was even HAPPY to help! That is just one great example of how the entire staff is determined to make personal connection and build everlasting relationships with their guests! The bar and its vaulted and ornate ceiling sets an evironment that is the heart of the social atmosphere. The attendants are eager to serve. The convention facilities are unmatched along with the details that differentiate this great gem. Congrats to the Palmer House for setting the standard! I think I might have heard Andy Williams and Frank Sinatra having a chat somewhere within this timeless and perfect place!

"The only bad thing I can think to say is that if they could only pick up the hotel and move it to north Michigan avenue it would be perfect! My first stay there, and it couldn't have been a more pleasant experience. I do like to walk out of my hotel to shop on Michigan when in Chicago and we realized that was not the case when we booked the room, but everyone needs to stay here at least once in their lifetime."
"My most recent stay in Chicago was here at The Palmer House. This is a grand old hotel that has been updated, but still retains the essence of a century ago. As a diamond member I have a larger suite that is very comfortable. The lobby is simply a thing of beauty. And if you are inclined to do so, the afternoon tea is a unique experience. Downtown in the heart of the loop, many Chicago theaters are only a short walk away. The staff here is great.

"The Palmer House really is a classic grand hotel.When you arrive and enter the lobby you're greeted by a massive grand room with amazing ceilings. Lots of space to enjoy a drink, have a chat or get some work done on the fly.I've stayed here twice - both times for a business conference - and each time the thing that made the experience most memorable was the staff. Everyone is incredibly kind and professional.While the lobby, mezzanine and conference rooms (4th Floor) are spotless, I found the hallways to be dirty. The carpets were quite messy both times I stayed and on my most recent trip last week, there was garbage on the floor outside my room.The rooms themselves are very clean. Bathrooms are spotless, carpets are tidy and not a speck of dust to be found.While clean, the rooms are all very different. As is the case with many old hotels, all the rooms have different sized bathrooms and main rooms. For example, my bathroom this year was half the size of my bathroom last year and in order to close the door to bathroom I almost had to step into the shower.Another thing some colleagues complained about was the sound of the L trains that runs along S Wabash Ave right next to the hotel. I like white noise as it helps me sleep and had the benefit this year of being on the 20th floor however the lower you go the louder it gets. My suggestion is if you want to avoid the noise either give up the view and ask for an interior room for a room on a higher floor.


Room Tip: Select rooms on the higher floors to avoid L train noise.

"The hotel was beautiful! I had gotten the room with 2 bathrooms thinking it was going to be much more luxurious but not so much but still nice so we could get ready more easily. The food/service/prices at Potters were the only big negative for our whole trip. We found a great Pub next door so if u want great food and drinks just go there. I did love the fact you are able to use the indoor pool/hot tub, workout area, and steam room. I would stay there again. The staff was nice and I don't remember Her name but a member of the housekeeping staff went out of her way to help."
"Decor was superb. Fitness center was very good but it could use a sauna room. Location was convenient at the downtown area. Room was a bit crowded. Drinking water is not available in the room. No coffee available in the room. Wifi is free at the lobby and at starbucks. Has extra charge for early check in. Housekeeping carts are almost always at the halls.

"Stayed here on Valentine's Day. Room was spacious, clean and very nice except the beds were very soft and uncomfortable. We could only get a room with 2 double beds. Glad we are Hilton Honors members because otherwise the line to check in was at least 60 deep! I have never seen such a long check-in line before! We were kept up all night by the adjoining room. They decided to have a party in their room starting at 1 a.m. and ending at around 5:30 a.m. You name it, we heard it! The next morning, there was another long line for breakfast. We chose to eat at the bar area so we didn't have to wait. Service was awful, but the buffet was okay. I would not stay here again for the reasons above."
"I celebrated my birthday on a Sunday night at the Palmer and it was wonderful!. We were upgraded to a suite with an extra joining bedroom. The suite was huge and had two complete bathrooms, plus the third in the attached bedroom! They were very updated considering the building itself is historic. The best part was how quite it was. We didn't hear a peep from anyone in the hotel, though we could hear the trains since our room was right above the Loop. It didn't bother us and I am a light sleeper. The rest of the hotel was beautiful and full of history. There were helpful staff all over the lobby to help find your way. If you are visiting the Art Institute (and you should!) you can't park any closer!

"The staff at this hotel are very attentive and will go out of their way to make your experience the best. The beautiful, historic hotel has so much history and you can learn a lot by just walking around the hotel and reading the plaques on the walls. I asked to be upgraded to a suite since it was my first trip to Chicago,and as a Hilton Diamond member they got me into a one-bedroom suite with a gorgeous view! Parking is right across the street in a garage, but it's very easy because they charge it to your room and give you a ticket so you don't have to worry about it. The Executive Lounge doesn't have much of a view, but the dedicated elevators make it very accessible. The Wi-Fi signal was strong, which is usually difficult in older hotels like this one. Wendell at the front desk made my stay here so great! He upgraded my room for me and had toothpaste sent up to my room when I mentioned that I was going to CVS to buy some. Thanks, Wendell!

"I've stayed here before and always have a comfortable stay, this time is no different. I choose a room on the Club floor this time as the price was really good. The room its self was lack luster ho hum etc., due to its location it had one window off to the side making it very dark all the time. It was nice and quiet from street noise. Rooms facing State Street are quieter as there is no train on State. The Club floor was very nice and the evening cocktail hour was very good the theme varied every night. The breakfast was ok. All of the non alcoholic beverages were available 24/7 with the exception of water which you had to ask for. The Club Floor elevator was nice as there was never a wait. There are always plenty of cabs waiting on Monroe. Would stay again."
"We stayed at the Palmer House over Valentine's Weekend, 2015. Everything was excellent about it. When we checked in, we were upgraded to a 2 bed/2 bathroom executive level room. The bathrooms were small, but with two of them, it worked fine. The room was quiet and the continental breakfast was very good. All the staff that we encountered were very friendly. Take time to explore the hotel. The lobby is worth looking at even if you don't stay there. There is a nice pool and huge fitness center on the 7th floor, which we did not even know was there until we found it the last night we were there.The best part about the hotel is it's location. We were able to walk to everything that we needed. On Friday, we did a walking tour of the loop area and nothing was too far away. My wife before we left had said that she needed a new pair of Crocs shoes. Well, lo and behold, there is a Croc store as part of the Palmer House and will even give you 10% off if you show them your Palmer House keycard. On Valentine's Day, we walked to the free shuttle bus at Millenium Park that took us to the auto show and back. That evening we went to Miller's Pub which is right next door. Even though it was 5 degrees outside, we were able to go without coats since it is so close. Parking can be expensive, but we booked the stay and park rate. The parking garage is right across the street from one of the three entrances, so was very convenient. Excellent stay and will be back."
"Just returned from the Palmer House yesterday and once again, wanted to send a shout out to everyone about how wonderful this hotel is! Check-in was super efficient, the rooms were clean and well appointed. The Executive Lounge under Rasha's leadership has never been better with fantastic service from Ernest and the whole crew. The food has a theme each night which keeps things interesting and the morning spread is better than ever. Hats off for taking something nice...to excellent! Great job again! We can't wait for our next visit."
"Ok, first of all, this is one of the most unorganized hotels I have ever stayed at. For starters, the way you get in is confusing, Wabash/Monroe, first floor or second, where is the luggage, what about parking? It's all a 20 minute run around before you check in. Glad to say check was smooth and professional but that's where it ended. Although it's beautiful and yes we expected a small, vintage room, we would have appreciated a window that actually looked OUTSIDE, not the interior of the building. Went to an event at which we discovered the elevators weren't working. No big deal we used the staff elevators all dressed in our finery. Went back to our room around midnight and laid in our beds wide awoke because there were young kids partying all night and the walls are paper thin. Over slept and then tried to call for a late check out, we were literally on hold for 20 minutes before we hung up. Called the operator back and she gave us the manager's desk which also kept us on hold for about 10 minutes before we just gave up! Oh, almost forgot about our dinner/dance service. (We were at Table 7 - Aspire Party-for retraining purposes) We had the rudest waitress I have ever encountered. She was so rude it became a joke. For instance, my husband asked for a particular piece of bread since she was passing them out based on her choice and she actually told him no because ""he already had one."" She then passed out coffee cups and didn't give him one. When he asked for a cup, she actually told him he as being a problem. Our host gave her his cup of coffee back and politely told him it was cold. After about five minutes, I reminded her that he was still waiting on his coffee and she said ""he already had coffee and complained that is was cold, so he'd now have to get his coffee from the dessert table!!"" Really? He paid $3,500 for the table we were at and he couldn't get a hot cup of coffee. In summary - not for me. We worked too hard and too long for poor service. Goodbye Palmer House.


Room Tip: If you must stay here, you should double check your view. If you don't ask, they won't tell.

"I spent three nights in the Palmer House while in town for a conference. I found a room on the Hilton website (not through a third-party aggregator) for $119/night, which surprised me, and I fully expected to be put in a smaller-than-average room in a crappy location. But when I checked in, the desk clerk offered to put me in a double-sized room on the 20th floor with a king bed at no extra charge. The room was very nice: indeed double-sized, with a wet bar (though sadly no fridge) and a large seating area with two easy chairs and a side table in addition to the usual work desk and a large chest of drawers. Hiltons are always pretty reliable in terms of comfort and cleanliness, and I wasn't disappointed: good bedding with high-quality pillows, a very comfortable mattress, dated but attractive furniture, plenty of power outlets (never a given with Grand Old Hotels like the Palmer House), and lots of elevators, which meant I was never stuck waiting for long. There were only two negatives with this room: first, the bathroom was tiny, which was okay for me but would have been a problem if I'd been traveling with a companion; second, it connected on two sides with other rooms, and there was no sound insulation whatsoever between my room and the adjoining ones. I could hear every word spoken by the couple in the room next door as well as everything they watched on TV. This doesn't seem to have a been a wall-thickness issue, but rather a problem of air space between the bottom of the connecting door and the floor. I travel with earplugs, so this wasn't a deal-killing problem, but it could be an issue for light sleepers. Otherwise, everything about this hotel was wonderful, especially the location. Two blocks away from the Art Institute, three blocks from Grant Park and the lake, right in the heart of the Loop -- you could hardly ask for better, and the price was pretty astonishing. Factor in the great service, and you have a hotel that I will stay at on future trips to Chicago whenever possible."
"I stayed at the Palmer House as a child, and walking into the magnificent lobby brought back all the old wonderful memories. The restoration that has been done to the property has indeed restored the grand lady to her former glory. The staff is wonderful, and the feeling refined. I looked forward to staying there and I was not disappointed. That said, realize that the rooms and especially the bathrooms will be on the smaller size due to the time in which the hotel was built. Elegant but small. All in all, an excellent two night stay in the heart of the city.Overall, the hotel and the room felt very clean. I marked it down slightly in this one regard because a room service tray sat in the hallway for almost a full 24 hours, through one cleaning cycle. That is a personal pet peeve of mine."
"I've stayed at this hotel many times, almost always at conventions. It's a great location, and an elegant and historic building. The new facility to check in on line and select a room is great, especially if you arrive late and the best rooms have gone.The rooms are nicely decorated but the air conditioning is lousy (I was attending an air conditioning convention!), noisy and the fan has to switch on and off to provide temperature control. The bathroom is more than bijou, you need to be a contortionist to reach the toilet paper.It has bags of meeting rooms and big events are run very well. I was a bit unlucky this time as someone near my room had a party that lasted to nearly 4.00 am.Despite being a bit nit-picky I'll go back, could do a lot worse.

"I stayed here for 4 nights over Christmas. I loved it!! Check in was very quick and easy. We stayed on the 13th floor and although we didnt have a great view, the room itself was fantastic! Two double beds and plenty of closet space. The bathroom was a little on the small side but that didn't bother me at all! The woman at the concierge desk was very pleasant and helpful and was always willing to suggest places to visit or restaurants in the area. The location was perfect, we walked everywhere (with the exception of the Museum of Science and Industry but we found taxi fares very reasonable).Only two things I wasn't happy about. 1. We ordered room service for breakfast on Christmas morning so we could relax in bed and open presents. The food was very nice but we paid highly for our relaxing Christmas morning. Advice: Don't order room service, too expensive! 2. We booked into the restaurant in the hotel for Christmas dinner. As you can imagine, our options were limited as it was Christmas day. Again, the food was lovely but definitely not worth $76 each, with not even a glass of wine included! Overall, I loved this hotel! It made my much anticipated first visit to Chicago absolutely perfect...not to mention we got engaged on Christmas Day too!! :)"
"I've stayed in several hotels in Chicago. None has impressed me enough to return. That is until I stayed at The Conrad. Not only is it in the perfect location, but the rooms are excellent (the bathroom surpasses expectations for a big city hotel) and so is the service. I arrived very early on a Saturday morning and they were able to check me in within an hour of my arrival. Not only that, the front desk clerk escorted me to my room personally since it was too early to have keys made. Additionally impressive ... they delivered a toiletry that I had forgotten to pack within minutes of my request and my call for a late check-out was immediately, and very pleasantly, granted. It's nice to have found a place I'm eager to return to."
"We stayed in Chicago Conrad hotel for a week and enjoyed the stay though we really did not spend much time at the hotel itself.Excellent customer service, excellent restaurant though little bit expensive to me as it did not include breakfast in the tariff so ordering based on menu was sort of expensive. Very convenient location, close to Michigan Avenue and most of the restaurants and cafes in the area. It's connected o Nordstrom shopping mall so that is a plus. Only bad thing about the rooms them self was that the shower in the bath was installed at 1.7 meters height so if you are taller you have to find your way as I did. Strange fact!!!Rooms excellently presented with TV cable, Bose audio and desk one you need to work.No swimming pool available, nice gym!Good stay overall.."
"I have stayed at this hotel a couple times. Most recently in March 2015. Can't beat the location for access to restaurants, bars and activities. I walked to everything and only had to take a cab the couple times I left the city limits. Great wifi connection for biz. Good romantic getaway as well. I found the place for cheap as a last minute reservation last time I stayed for work. It was a steal in the low $100s per night. Also, I got into town on a red eye flight because I was going down last minute for work. They let me check in at 9am. Unheard of! I'm guessing this isn't normal but I could be wrong. Either way, the fact they did it for me shows they go the extra mile!"
We were in Chicago for a mother/daughter trip. The room was extremely comfortable as were the beds. Never heard a sound in the hallway. We enjoyed sitting in the lounge areas for a drink and just to plan our days. We loved the fruit infused iced water in the lobby and it was the first stop we made after a long day of walking the city! The staff was very friendly and helpful. We will most definitely stay at the Conrad again. You will not be disappointed.
"We love the Conrad in Indy so we were really disappointed not to find the same quality of service in this facility. We were greeted warmly but then provided a room already occupied. So we were switched to another room and found it too occupied. This is with toting our luggage and a lethargic child (that really needed to lie down) from floor to floor. When we finally made it to our room we found a used bar of soap and a plastic laundry bag with a pair of women's panties in them! The staff did address and apologized promptly. However, their apology was a bottle of wine we didn't care for, some semi-stale M&Ms, two drink passes and two breakfast passes (although we already had breakfast included in our package so that was actually pointless). Interesting though when they came to deliver the apology gifts they had to get in our frig to retrieve something else left behind from the previous occupant. We do think it is a nice property that is well located and appointed, but attention to detail is supposed to be their hallmark and that was clearly a miss with our visit."
"Since my last stay at this conrad, coffee/tea/cocoa is no longer complimentary provided in the lobby are and the wine happy hour is gone. There are no coffee makers in the room, so for that coffee in the morning youi need to have it in the restaurant or buy it from the small kiosk in the lobby. Was a better value to run outside to starbucks. Room was again very comfortable, bottled water provided in the rooms. Was upgraded from a room with a view of a building to another room with a view of a different building. It was still a great stay. Manager was visible in the lobby at times to greet guests and answer questions. Nice gesture, please continue. Will definitely be back here again."
"Our stay at the Conrad was the second leg of our 5th year anniversary trip and it didn't disappoint at all. Although the main lobby doesn't have that ""grand"" feel it makes up for it in class, cleanliness and a overall warm feeling. All of the staff were excellent and attentive. We ate breakfast at the restaurant and it was very satisfying. The location of the hotel can not be downplayed enough, it is perfect. Everything we wanted to do was either a short walk or short ride. What made this a perfect trip for my wife and I was the room! The bed was amazing, exactly what two third shift workers needed. The bathroom was absolutely perfect. The tub was deep and wide enough for soaking and the shower was inviting as well. The only issue we had was the high price of valet, however we contacted a friend who allowed us to park our car at his home, that saved over 100 dollars. The Conrad was one of the more beautiful hotels I have stayed at and can't wait to stay again."
"We stayed at the Conrad for one night. The rate was really a bargain given the quality of the property and the location ... maybe due to it being a Friday night. Since I had never stayed at a Conrad before I had no idea what to expect and had to trust the positive Trip Advisor reviews. The following Sunday I was back in Chicago for two nights and stayed at the Westin on Michigan and besides the fact that they are both hotels, there was little in common. The Conrad was freshly up to date in decor and was very clean. The room was nicely sized and the beds comfortable. The lighting, television, etc. was all in good repair. This hotel is very close to the river and a block off of Michigan Avenue for people who want to walk the city. Also, it is connected by skyway to a mall and parking, which was quite convenient with the cold weather. The front desk staff was very friendly and offered a complimentary bottle of water. The lobby area seemed comfortable and trendy. WiFi was free to me because my firm has a contract with Hilton. The only drawback was that to get to the lobby from street level one need take an elevator -- small inconvenience. I will return to this Conrad again."
"If you are planning a trip to Chicago, I would recommend this hotel. It's location is great - direct access to the Magnifcent Mile and walking distance to the lake. You actually never have to go outside if you don't want to - shopping and dining all available under one roof! The staff were subpurb and accomodations great! More importantly, the environment and location made me very comfortable, considering I was traveling by myself."
"We stayed at this hotel for four nights over New Years, last week. Hotel is in the perfect location for shopping and restaurants. We were upgraded to a suite upon check in. Staff was exceptionally friendly, and helpful with any questions. Rooms are updated and well decorated, as were the beds very comfortable. Lounge area has several tvs and a large sitting area. Would definitely recommend staying at this hotel."
"We got a terrific rate that was only $150 per night (through Hilton's site) which included valet parking. A total steal! The hotel location, amenities, and quality were top notch. The rooms could use an update but not bad enough for us not to stay again! The hotel is connected to the Nordstrom mall, close to restaurants, etc...we would definitely stay again!

"We absolutely loved the Conrad. Service is wonderful, the rooms are spacious, the bed is comfortable and you have a pillow menu. The bathroom is huge with a separate walk in shower and deep bathtub. We were on the 15th floor and had a great view of the city. It is one block from Michigan Avenue and connected to a mall. It is the perfect location and you couldn't stay somewhere nicer. Would definitely stay there again."
"We have stayed at the Conrad in Chicago before, 3 years ago. The hotel is located in a great spot to explore downtown and especially to be able to shop at Nordstroms. It does need a face lift and attention to detail to be as luxury rated as the other Conrad properties. Our room had a terrific view and was very spacious but the carpet was old and the room was dusty. The halls had worn carpet that needed a vacuum. The bed and pillows were great. The staff was friendly and professional but after the holidays they seemed honestly tired. Our breakfast was good but pricey and the jam my husband picked had already been opened and put away that way, yuck.

First time at this type of Hilton. Rooms are large as are baths. I have never seen a more pleasant service staff. Everyone seems to be very happy working there and taking care of customers. It is adjacent to a Hugh shopping mall which includes Nordstrom's. The breakfast package for two is worth $42 each day so it is a bargain and they have French press coffee. There is also a coffee bar if you just want a Togo.
"We stayed in this hotel November 16th-17th. The staff was very pleasant, the rooms are clean and the service was excellent. The lobby bar was a nice place to sit and unwind after shopping. Everyone was very polite and helpful. The location was great, convenient to shopping ( It is connected to the shops at North Bridge) and centrally located to all of the best restaurants. I would recommend this hotel to friends."
"We stayed at the Conrad for a weekend in Chicago with our grand daughter. The Conrad is always such a pleasure. Staff is welcoming and warm, rooms are excellent, the restaurant is a great place for breakfast, lunch, and/or dinner. It is very convenient (connected) to the Shops at North Bridge - many, many shopping options and good food court.

"I attended a conference at and stayed in this hotel for three nights in November 2014. I was once again very impressed!Per usual, my guest room was superb--an extremely comfortable bed, understated and elegant design, very nice products in the bathroom, super-soft towels, the perk of a Keurig coffee maker, etc. Furthermore, during my particular visit, the price was superb--I got a far higher-quality room at this hotel (separate tub/shower, etc.) than I would have at properties nearby that were more expensive.Service was solid. Check-in was welcoming, housekeeping was very timely and responsive, and those who assisted with the meetings in the conference rooms were extremely nice and happy to help.I was impressed with the quality of the conference facilities. The ballrooms and breakout rooms were comfortably appointed and designed, with spacious pre-function space. The food served at the meetings was excellent--not your regular hotel food! Each day's options included several appealing items that were healthy, delicious, and presented beautifully. Would very happily return!"
"This was my first stay at the Conrad here in Chicago, having previously stayed at both the Hilton and Drake. Having never really been satisfied at either of the two, I thought I would pay a little bit extra to get the Conrad. And it was the best investment I could have made! I will not stay at any other hotel in Chicago again!Nice and spacious rooms with both bath and shower and very cosy yet large king bed. Breakfast is absolutely fantastic (as a HH Gold one gets two vouchers altogether valued at around $34 I think), so plenty to choose from). Very tasty made to order omelettes, some of the best sausages and bacon I have had in a long time, good blueberry parfait too!Spotless service by the front-desk and everybody around, I really enjoyed the stay!City centre, great location nearby everything important and worth visiting. Good views of the city from the upper floors too.

"I had been here with my son and daughter in January. Now, returned with my husband. Once more,everything was what one could expect of it.Check in and check out done efficiently and with warm kindness, not so often in these big hotels. As they could not upgrade us, they offer tickets for Breakfast. They have a 19 dollars value and if one spends more, one could pay for it. We had breakfast there the five days we stayed at the hotel and I should say that the quality of the service and of the food offered is really awesome. The ""Fresh fruit plate"", my favorite not only with a great variety of fruits but presented with good taste. People at the breakfast room is courteous and nice. A good way to begin the day. I recommend having breakfast there but if you find it rather expensive, there are many places nearby and just across the street. Do not worry about it.Bedroom was big and comfortable with a big desk to work on it. Good light to read in bed or work at desk. Bath clean and modern. Shower with great water pressure: a pleasure when coming back after being walking through a very cold city.Fitness center open 24 hours, very quiet and with many new machines. It is true that there are only two bikes but the other machines are wonderful.Very clean.Wi Fi free for us (Platinum HH) and very good and easy connection, even from the rooms.Concierge service ready to help you at any time. Very glad to have returned . waitng to have the chance to come back."
"Very nice room with all the amenities that you'd expect from a Conrad. Convenient location with direct access to a mall and walking distance to several restaurants. Service was professional but not personable. Staff seemed more interested in themselves than assisting guests. Disappointing service considering the price and the fact that there are several other more reasonably priced options in...

"We booked the King bed Jr suite and I must say it reminded me of the Peabody hotel minus the ducks. It was really nice and a prime location. You can go down the elevators to the Shops at North Bridge. Then step right out on Michigan Ave. The staff was friendly and helpful. While I am trying to experience a variety of hotels while in Chicago this one will get booked again and again. The bed was so comfortable that I didn't even realize I had fallen asleep. They give you robes and slippers. The water pressure was right. The room temp was right. The pillows kept eating up my head...lol. Very spacious. We had two rooms, the junior suite and a double. They were both very spacious! We didn't get to enjoy the terrace roof top but it is on our bucket list. The bartender that Sunday afternoon was great as my male friend stayed behind to catch Sunday football. Self parking is right across the street on Rush. This hotel is just a prime location for just about everything downtown!The only thing I have negative to say about this is the fact that they put a nice heavy lighted mirror in the bathroom that is a magnifying glass and not a mirror. It would have been great if it had a dual purpose. The only thing this was good for was plucking my eyebrows. I needed it to see the back of my hair but NOPE - wasn't possible and it quite heavy to pick up! But that was very minor. I also requested upgrades when I booked but they made no mention of them when I checked in. We stayed at the WIT on Saturday night and they informed me that early checkin and late checkout was not available. I also requested a room upgrade which they didn't bother to comment on. You do get charged for this after all so it was not like they were giving me something. They were kind to ask if they could hold our luggage until it was time for our 6pm flight which was very thoughtful.

"I stayed at a competitor across the street many years ago. I was in a shoe box sized, dated room, and happened to look across the street to the rooms of the Conrad. I walked across the street and found out I would save money, have a better experience, and have the use of a much nicer room. I checked in at that moment and have been back about a dozen times. Recently, I have been getting the terrace suites, which are a bargain for a view overlooking Michigan Ave. I haven't ever considered trying any other hotel in Chicago."
This hotel is in one of the best locations in Chicago. It is close enough to the magnificent mile yet away enough that it is quieter. The best part of the location though is the access to shopping and food! The entry to the mall is nice in the winter so you don't have to lug coats around. There is a movie theatre really close. The hotel itself is a standard Conrad which is exceptional. It is great for business and families. Highly recommend!!
"It is often hard to find a reasonable priced quality hotel near Michigan Avenue. I come to town at least once or twice a year to shop and visit the city and love staying on. Michigan Avenue. This hotel was great. The room size was fantastic. The tv was set up through a Bose system, which was different and made the sound a little unusual. All of the staff was very helpful - the lady in the gift shop was very nice. It is a wonderful location. You do not have to walk outside to get to the shoppes at north bridge as it is connected to the hotel. The bathrooms seemed newly remodeled and were very nice. Can't think of anything bad to say about this place. Can't wait to visit again."
"I stayed here for 3 nights as I was working at an event in McCormick Place. The hotel is conveniently situated just off Michigan Avenue so it is a great location for shoppers. The bedroom was a good size with a large bathroom. The bed was very comfortable and I slept very well. The only disappointment was the dining and lounge areas, they seemed too basic for what is classed as a ""luxury establishment"" and had very limited choice on the menu. At breakfast time it got very busy so the staff found it difficult to cope with the demand. In the early evenings the bar area got very crowded, there was limited seating and again the staff found it difficult to meet the demand. However, on balance i would recommend this hotel but suggest you dine in one of the great restaurants nearby."
"The outstanding features of this hotel are probably its location, so proximal to Magnificent Mile, and also the size of the rooms. The front desk staff was very polite and helpful. The complimentary coffee in the lobby in the morning was hot, good, available... many teas, etc to choose from too. I liked the location of the bar. It was between the entry/lobby and the rooms. While this might sound odd, it lent to a very pleasant, casual experience. We did not dine in the hotel, as we had heard that this was supposed to be less than positive. There were numerous good eating spots within a stone's throw though. One cool spot to try, if it fits your desires, is Billy Goat's Cheese Burger, Cheese Burger, Cheese Burger (made famous by the old SNL skit). It is less than a minute from the hotel. We would stay again at the Conrad, no question.


Room Tip: twelfth floor was just fine, we were close to elevator (1229), and had no noise

"Conrad stands for luxury hilton, but there is no luxury in this hotel! The room is spacious, but it looks old, no design to it. The toilet got clogged once, and the water would not stop running, so if you woke up to use the bathroom, you'll have to get up again and switch the water off. A sock lost under the bed remained their until checkout. The room (828) was right by the elevator, and i could hear eny ladies heels any time of the day, because the elevator lobby had no carpet. 8 floor is conveniently accessed from the Rush street level. The front desk staff was polite and efficient. The blonde server at breakfast was very nice, all other were not efficient enough, and took 5$ off my bill, well, I'd better pay an extra ten for getting a loose tea, rather than a bag, and for receiving warm soy milk instead of cold, as requested. But can't but mention that the food wuality and taste are exceptional, the chefs are great! Upon arrival nobody has offered to take care of our bags. The hotel provides free water and wifi, which is nice. The gym is good, the a/c works fine. The lobby area is also fine. The Conrad Tokyo was wonderful, this one is not even slightly close. The trump chicago we stayed in previous time was outstanding!"
"Overall I would give this hotel an average rating. I didn't find anything spectacular to rave about from the time I registered to the time I left. The bed wasn't a good fit for me...too soft, but some of my colleagues said they slept great. The hotel drink prices are expensive. I had a 2 telephone charges for on my bill (as did some of my colleagues) for calls I did not make......in this day of cell phones, does one really need to use a hotel phone? Of course the front desk provided me with a corrected bill. If I were traveling for pleasure, I wouldn't go out of my way to stay at this hotel. It is convenient for shopping.

"Spent one night during the week. As gold member was given an upgraded room. The room was fine, bathroom had a large tub and a stand alone shower stall. They also had a small black towel for people to use when removing make-up. The first time we've seen that in a hotel. Public spaces were not impressive. The bar is on the main walkway between the front desk and elevators to the guest rooms so people with suitcases are passing through at all hours. Restaurant for breakfast had good service but poor food. Eggs were merely warm. Coffee was good and hot. Sausages were largely tasteless. The Rush Street entrance is below a walkway insuring darkness no matter the time of day. Not impressive. Then you must take an elevator to the 5th floor to register at the other lobby. Becomes annoying to have to take two elevators every timed you want to enter or leave the building. I guess it is a technique for keeping the homeless out of the hotel.Location is wonderful for shoppers and people in town for a good time. About a mile from most cultural venues.It is a good hotel but not a great hotel and does not stand out from other hotels in its class in the Hilton chains."
"We really didn't use all of the hotels amenities,but what we did experience was excellent. We were here for a medical meeting so received convention pricing. Our room did not have much of a view but we also had not requested one. The room was large with extremely comfortable king sized bed( lots of pillows),plenty of lighting, a desk,chair and ottoman, flat screen TV,safe, and a small refrigerator you can have stocked. The bathroom was very nice with a separate toilet room, soaking tub,separate shower and plenty of counter space for cosmetics. Beautifully clean. I will say I have never seen as narrow of a tub outside of Europe. High end bathroom toiletries and plenty of hot water with good water pressure. They also supplied robes and slippers. Just little touches that make you more comfortable. Turn down service must be requested. We did have the concierge make two dinner reservations for us,one at our request and one at her suggestion. Her suggestion was excellent and her manner was very friendly and helpful. The public spaces are modern and lovely. Coffee service is in the lobby every morning and pretty good too ! The location is great for shopping on Michigan Avenue. I would stay here again."
"Nice convenient location to shop and visit restaurants. A block from Michigan Avenue on Rush Street. Outdoor rooftop patio is a nice touch for drinks and dining. The hotel is connected directly to shopping including Nordstrom's. We opted for a two room suite which had all the necessities and then some. We had breakfast each morning in the restaurant where the service was quick and food good. The hotel bar had a nice assortment of upper shelf liquors, Hendricks Gin and Brugal Rum to name a few.Service staff is top notch.This is the second time we stayed at the Conrad and have been pleased both times.

"Had a very pleasant 6 day stay here recently. Located right in the heart of the city - close to where Michigan Avenue crosses the river, so literally an easy walk to anywhere downtown. Minutes to Michigan Avenue, an easy walk to Navy Pier, loads of restaurants shops and bars within crawling distance. Hotel itself was fine, clean with all the amenities you could want. I had a wheelchair accessible room so the room and bathroom was huge (not sure if all rooms are like this). Bathroom was nice, bed very comfortable, nice tv with 60 channels (must be America!). Friendly and helpful staff. The hotel overall is not quite as polished as Conrad hotels in other parts of the world (particularly Asia) but this is typical of these chain hotels when comparing the USA to restof the world. Still a very pleasant and trouble-free stay.I used the laundry service once and had no problems. The fitness centre is fine with properly working equipment (and open 24hrs). Complimentary wifi which worked well.My only complaints were that someone in a nearby room had a dog (ridiculous) that you could sometimes hear. Also the layout of the 5th floor is silly - the reception and bar area are on the 5th floor and face directly on to some of the guest rooms on the 5th floor, which means you get some noise in those rooms - avoid the rooms close to the elevators on the 5th floor.Overall a good stay, I will stay here again when I next visit Chicago."
"You know how it goes, you have a hundred windows open and then availability starts to disappear and you just book the next one. I knew the area I wanted to be in - walking distance to the miracle mile (this looks like it might be a block away, but actually it's on it) and close to everything else. We loved it! Nice sized rooms, comfy beds/sheets, nice bathroom with separate toilet, nice toiletries. Lovely lobby to chill out in, high end breakfast options, service was smooth and helpful everywhere. We got a really good rate that included breakfast, which was a nice surprise (all those windows, I didn't know what I was booking by the end!) I would definitely stay there again. We were a family, I would recommend it for older children, but not necessarily younger/tiny ones. Very good for business and I saw quite a few single business women, who felt comfortable staying there, as well as groups of business travelers and older families."
"I had a convention at McCormack and being HHonors Diamond, I wanted to stay at a Hilton property. I could have stayed at The Palmer House, Hilton Chicago, or The Drake which all had convention pricing but I decided to pay a little more and try the Conrad. The location was good, being close to Michigan Avenue. The entrance and lobby was unimpressive but the check-in process was efficient. The room was a good size and clean and modern but not luxurious. Having stayed at a number of Conrad hotels, I was a little underwhelmed. From reading the reviews here, I expected a little more than a good clean hotel."
"We very much wanted a city view for our brief honeymoon. We were quite disappointed that the advertised ""city view"" room on their booking site and from speaking with two separate booking agents for the hotel, was a view of the one building across the street, The Interncontinental Hotel. We had even requested the highest room available, but we were only placed on the 5th floor. Maybe that's what's considered a ""city view"", but we felt very mislead by the site and the agents we spoke with. However with that being said, the room was lovely, very clean, and very quiet. That helped make up for the disappointment in the view we were really hoping to have. They also provided us with complimentary chocolate covered strawberries and designer water which was a very lovely and appreciated gesture. The location of the Conrad was perfect. Very easy walking distance to all of the places we wanted to go, and we made some good finds in the area as well. I would stay there again if I wasn't interested in having a view.

We have stayed at this hotel a few times. The rooms are spacious and the beds are comfortable. The staff is very friendly and always willing to make suggestions. We ate breakfast at the hotel every morning and were very pleased with the selection. It was delicious! This hotel is connected to a mall which leads to the Magnificent Mile. It is very conveniently located and just a few minutes walk from all attractions. There are also a lot of good restaurants close by. The Conrad definitely provides good value and will not disappoint.
"The Conrad is a great place to stay while visiting Chicago. We stayed for 4 nights in a King room. The room was spacious, comfortable, and clean. The bathroom was fantastic - the shower had the best water pressure I've ever experienced! Location was perfect for seeing the city. It is about a 3 minute walk to the Red line. The CTA is a great system for getting around the city - no car needed. If you're coming to Chicago for shopping, the hotel is just around the corner from Magnificent Mile making it very convenient. I would definitely stay at the Conrad again!"
"Are there better hotels in Chicago? Sure, but not at this price on the Magnificent Mile. Located on top of the Nordstrom, the location is second to none. I am in Chicago at least twice a year for business and always stay at this location. Great to shopping, Water Tower, the Loop, restaurants, etc. Quick suggestion ... always ask whether an upgrade is available and many times it is. Also, staff is very friendly and accommodating.

"While in Chicago I do usually stay at the Conrad. The Hotel is just around the corner of the Magnificent Mile and other Chicago downtown attractions like the Wrigley building, Trump Tower, Watertower etc. The hotel lobby is on the 5th floor of a shopping mall and rooms stretch up to the 19th (?) floor I believe. Rooms are spacious, clean with a comfortable bed. The bathrooms are featuring a shower and bathtub and seperate toilette.Free coffee is available in the lobby at 6 a.m. and two bottles of still water are in your room always.I always like to return there and it feels almost like home.."
"Always enjoy a stay at the Conrad Chicago. It is conveniently located just minutes to the Magnificent Mile where you will find lots of great shopping and dining options. An easy walk to Millennium and Grant Parks as well as Navy Pier, just to name a few of Chicago's sights. Rooms are well appointed and include comfy robes and slippers. Hotel staff is accommodating and friendly. Unlike many downtown hotels the WiFi is complimentary! A fitness center, pleasant bar and in house restaurant round out this very nice hotel.

"booked a night for a birthday gift. now that I've spent a night...no need to return. lobby was a ""hike"" to get to. room was nice, city view was a small view. location was perfect. based on the cost of the room, I think I expected a bit more. limited exposure with staff, check-in and check-out were swift. I agree with an earlier review, a $25.00 charge for early check-in seemed a little tacky for a fancy hotel."
"We have stayed here a number of times and never been disappointed. I find the rooms to be comfortable and quiet, and nicely appointed. The lobby bar is nice and the rooftop is a great place for a quick cocktail on the way to something more interesting. The perfect location is the real reason to go though. My wife loves being able to take the elevator to Nordstrom's and then on to do more damage on Michigan Ave. I love being being right in the heart of an area with several of our favorite restaurants and great nightlife spots. This is a great place for a quick getaway."
"I really can't say enough good things about this hotel, so I am a bit unsure where to start. First, they allowed us to check in at 11am as our flight was an early arrival. Since it was our anniversary trip, they sent up wine and chocolate covered strawberries for us at no cost. Sweet! We had a few issues while staying (TV didn't work, we were locked out of room due to mechanical error with door lock) and both times the staff were quick and friendly, and did everything they could to accommodate us. The staff can be trusted as well...I left my THREE diamond rings in the lobby bathroom (taking advantage of those awesome scrubbing salts) and the were found...they held on to them for me till we were able to get back (after check out) to retrieve them. Comfy beds, large bathrooms and all the amenities needed. Will stay here again. Breakfast was even great! Loved this place."
"Centrally located with large nicely appointed rooms, the Conrad is a good choice for a quick business trip. The outdoor patio is a great place to decompress with a glass of wine after a full day of meetings.Two quick comments - the person who checked me in did not tell me that the mini bar was not stocked, nor did he mention that coffee was available in the lobby. Also, I had to ask whether wifi was included in the rate (though I knew that it was). Little things, but worth noting for future guests.Great breakfast, and the wait staff was terrific.


Room Tip: Always check to see if wifi is included - some rates include it others don't.

"I actually reside in Chicago, but decided to stay here for a weekend-in town-get away. The Conrad is a very nice hotel, the staff was cordial as well. I really like that the hotel had an enclosed walk-way that leads directly to Nordstrom's (Michigan Ave.) and the other stores located within the shopping area. The hotel was moderately priced just as the others within that vicinity. Downtown Chicago is customarily pricy. It was close in proximity to great Mag Mile Shopping!! So whether you reside in Chicago or an out of town visitor, this would be a very nice hotel to visit."
Not very impressive. They charge you a $25 fee for an early check in. The room is ready and they are charging the greedy.The view from some of the rooms is a building with broken walls.And last check out is 12:00.If you go out for breakfast and do not leave a Do Not Disturbed sign. At about 10:00 they will come in and throw away your stuff. Then you will get a sorry from the check in host.I am not very happy about loosing my items and getting a sorry..
"We loved our stay at the Conrad. I booked this hotel as a surprise for my husband's birthday trip to Chicago. We were very pleased with the location (short walk to the Magnificent Mile and the convenience to the Red Line). The rooms were very spacious and quiet.

"I was planning a simple overnight stay in order to experience the city for a mini-vacation. I found the Conrad online while doing a search for hotels in the Michigan Ave area. A Sunday night stay is of course cheaper than a Friday or Saturday night stay, which worked perfectly because that was the day that I was staying! The registration process was simple and quick, checking into the hotel was extremely painless and the concierge was eager to assist in any way possible. My room on the 11th floor was big and clean with a wonderful view of the city. The bathroom was also big with a big beautiful shower. I couldn't get enough of this place! I didn't spend a ton of time at the hotel itself due to having a packed schedule, but I did take time to sit at the bar and have a drink. I expected the drinks to be pretty pricey, and a martini was $15. Fortunately, it happened to be the most delicious martini I've ever had and the bartender was a wonderful sweet gal who knew exactly how to make friendly conversation with a stranger."
Heart of Michigan ave and hubbard street where lots of restaurants are located great place! Also has a rooftop deck and lounge area. Great place!!! And great location!! Public transportation all within a couple blocks to everything. Would Definatley stay here again. Location to hotel kind of tricky off rush st which is not flush with Michigan ave it's located underneath kinda confusing look it up of you are not familiar.
"This hotel has a tiny street entrance, but the lobby in the fifth floor is very nice. The fireplace is different of all you have seen before, built inside a glass box. The staff is friendly and helpful. The rooms are large and very comfortable. There is a parking facility that you can reach from inside the hotel by the lift what is very convenient.


Room Tip: If you stay in the fifth floor, choose a room far from the lobby that is too noisy.

Stayed here for work this past week - two nights on the 10th floor. So - I think it was a bit loud in my room. I could hear people running or walking and I think it was above me. It wasn't consistent or all the time - and it certainly did not wake me up at night. I found out the first day of our meetings = that the 11th floor is where the ballroom and gym are - so I think being below that might have contributed to the noise because people staying on other levels (as well as others on level 10) did not hear anything. So that is the only negative. It's a great location - connected to a mall and Nordstroms. Has a nice rooftop terrace bar....fyi - rooftop of the mall - 5th floor - not roof top of the actual hotel. Still really nice though. Loved that there was a pillow menu - the bathroom was very large with everything you could need provided -including robes and slippers. The bed was awesome!! Was sad to come home to my boring bed with only 4 pillows. LOL.We had our breakfasts & lunches at the hotel - both were very good. I would absolutely go back and recommend the Conrad to anyone heading to Chicago or looking to host a work event there. One little fun bit was they had sea salts in the bathrooms (by the ballroom - not sure if they are everywhere) - they changed the type 2x a day and there were 'instructions' on how to give yourself a mini-hand massage. Loved that.
"You can walk to many restaurants, bars and shops in this River North location. Nordstrom is next door in the shopping mall. The hotel itself is well done with good size rooms and quality furnishings. Overnight valet parking is very expensive at $60. Room rates are reasonable compared to the other chains. The breakfast and service at the front desk was excellent. Conrad is part of the Hilton chain. If you are sensitive to noise, try staying on the higher floors."

"Conrad is a Hilton for those of use who collect or use points. It is centrally located and very convenient for catching the metro or just walking. The service was excellent. It is connected to a mall for easy shopping. Nearby (within 5 mins) is a Pizza Uno for true Chicago deep dish pizza, the Eataly which is an awesome foodie experience, the Yolk which is great for brunch, the the Sable for lunch or dinner. See my writeups on these.Enjoy!"
"First time at the property and was very satisfied. Nice open modern lobby area with plenty of comfortable chairs and spaces to meet and talk. Attached to the North Bridge mall which provides easy access to shopping (especially Nordstroms) and restaurants as well as Michigan Ave. Room was good size,especially the bathroom, and staff was friendly and helpful. My only ding is that some of the furniture looked like it had seen better days, especially my side table where the veneer was broken in the corner and coming off. A minor complaint however and wouldn't hesitate to stay here again."
"We stayed here for one night for my birthday. The Conrad is a very nice hotel with large and comfortable rooms. The location is great because it is attached to the Nordstrom mall and Michigan Avenue. We upgraded to a larger room. I was pleased with the room, but was disappointed by the view. I had previously stayed in the JW Marriott Hotel which is probably in the same class hotel. I did prefer the JW Marriott (though location is very different as it is in the loop) because it felt more luxurious. I was disappointed the Conrad had no pool."
"I'm a fan of this hotel having stayed here 3 or 4 times now. There is much to be said about the place, great location, good facility, quiet (important in a city like Chicago), good restaurant (though pricey).My most recent stay had multiple parties taking two rooms. Everything went well. I only have two short commentator management regarding housekeeping (which was otherwise great). One of our bathrooms had a couple of mold spots above the shower. In the other bed room we had to look at a greasy body print on the window for two days. None of these items replicated itself in the other room, nor were they anything I had experienced before. I would not let that change my opinion about staying here, it's a great place. These are my only reasons for not giving it a top score"
"This hotel has a great location, great staff, a good healthy breakfast option for meal vouchers, and treats the guests typically well, but I had too many items disappointment on this visit. First, my initial room smelled like smoke. The front desk quickly brought up a new key, but that should not happen in an upgraded room. Second, I realized about 4am that someone had left the window open in my new room. How did I notice - the loud honking outside that seemed to fill up the room. Where is the cleaning staff in either room? Third, I asked for shaving cream - 45 minutes later I had to leave for my meetings and no shaving cream. Nothing like a soap shave to start the day. Finally, the TV is a pain to turn on and off and there's no sleep time."

"The hotel is conveniently located and looks very nice, but has too many problems. Rooms are not up to date--mattresses are very soggy, a/c does not work properly, and fridge was broken. Cleanliness is also questionable. One of the towels had a stain, as did one of the bed sheets. Housekeeping did not properly clean rooms--at one point we had to call the front desk for more toilet paper because it hadn't been re-stocked. There was a permanent bad smell in the room, so bad that we were forced to open up windows even though it was very cold outside. The rooms made it sound as if wifi was free, but you actually had to pay. The hotel has a very nice location, and once upon a time might have been a nice place to stay, but I will not go again."
"Stayed here while at a convention. Although a bit far from the convention center, it is directly on the bus route and doesn't take long to travel to and from due to the bus dedicated route. This is very important, because although not close to the convention center, it is very close to lots of things to see and do!

I wish it was a different place to in the hotel. The parking is way to high 70 bucks a night geeeesh. Park some where else cheaper and just walk to the hotel. Mini bar in room is nice, but it is a charge for it as well. Over all the hotel is nice. Will stay again."
"Located at the edge of Millennium Park, a block from the river, a couple from Magnificent Mile, and a few from the lake, this was the ideal location for an extended weekend trip without the need for a car. Cabs were readily available when we wanted one, plus the cab drivers knew exactly where this hotel is. The lobby was beautiful, the room was comfortable and spacious, and the staff was engaging and helpful. The concierge was exceptionally helpful answering questions and offering suggestions."
We stayed here during my husband's business trip. Great location. You have easy access (within walking distance) to a lot of attractions. We stayed on the 21st floor. The room was clean. One item in the bathroom (the industrial toilet like the one you see in the mall with the steel pipes showing) weirded me out. Shower was clean and free of mildew (one of my biggest pet peeves). Room had a mini fridge (big plus for me). Bed was very comfortable. Liked how the bed faced the window so you could enjoy the city views. We had breakfast downstairs both mornings and it was great. Service was excellent. Coffee was also excellent. The front door guys were very helpful on giving both walking directions and CTA directions. Bottomline: I recommend and we would stay here again.
"I stayed last month at Fairmont for my CCIM exams. The rooms were fantastic and service of Vidya in the gold was exemplary. She took care of all our service request and needs with great attention to detail . I personally wanted to give her an hug for the amazing service .The gold lounge is the perfect place for relaxation,enjoyment and recreation. I would recommend fairmont gold to everyone I know . Its one of the best hotels in the city and Vidya provided me the best service I have ever experienced in and across US and she truly represents the brand for amazing and memorable service. Coming back here again for the exceptional service.

"In the lobby wine bar early in the morning, The Fairmont Hotel has a breakfast bar instead of a wine bar with practical and healthy breakfast choices, ranging form a breakfast sandwich with eggs or egg whites and choices of turkey or pork sausage, hot chocolate or coffee or tea and fresh juices and a wide array of pastries. But the best is its oatmeal with a choice of blueberries, large raisins, cinnamon, walnuts and brown sugar, served piping hot, with your favorite newspaper. But the thing I remember best about it was the sweet little old lady who was manning it so cheerfully every morning and greeting me with a smile each day and helpful advice and suggestions when I asked her for same. She made me feel at home and very welcome to the hotel. To me, she was the kind face of hospitality at The Fairmont. Thank you for having an employee like her. She made my stay much more enjoyable and started off my day in the right mind set everyday with her cheerful and helpful outlook on life. Making her guests feel comfortable and welcome was her Job One. Hope you can find more folks like her to work for your hotel. Not only is she a good face for the Fairmont, but she is also a good face for Chicago!"
"The Fairmont is a nice hotel. It's large and rather impersonal with a slight bent toward the business person. We had a upper floor suite with a separate bedroom and large living room. It was certainly lovely but appointed with rather bland furnishings. I like flair and style. The Fairmont is lacking in both but certainly is not a dump. It just doesn't have that big metropolitan pizzazz that one comes to expect from the Fairmont. It's uninspiring. Having said that, the service is wonderful and the cleanliness is second to none. I'd go to another hotel only to aim for the grandeur that I feel this place is missing. But for the business traveler, you can't beat it."
"I reserved the Lincoln Park Grand Suite expecting something wonderful but greeted with disappointment. I reserved the rom for my boyfriend and I from Feb 20 thru Feb 22. We arrived early to drop off our luggage and asked if the room gets done sooner to text my cell so we will know when we can come back. The room was prepared early which was appreciated but, the main entrance into the suite didn't lock. Anyone could just walk in with a simple push on the door. Which some of the staff did do which was a real lack of privacy which made me uncomfortable. When I complained about it as we were leaving for dinner I was hopping once we got back it would be fixed. We can back 3 hours later to noticed the door still could just be pushed opened. running the bath the water came out red from rust along with hair still in the tub. We let the water run which eventually cleared up but we were paying so much money for the suite why couldn't they make sure the water was clear or clean the bathroom? Our privacy wasn't respected, the staffing didn't care about our concerns, and the room wasn't well kept. I was greatly disappointed after spending so much money for the suite.

"We took the grandsons to the Shedd Aquarium. Figured we would find a moderately priced hotel close to the Aquarium and the Rain Forest cafe. I used google maps to find a parking garage that I thought was close by ( next door) and drove to the hotel after a day at the Aquarium. Well after about three time around the block we give up on the parking garage and pulled in to what was promoted as hotel parking. A attendant ( who had on nothing to identify him as a hotel employee) came and got the car and gave us the very brief explanation on how to find the front desk. I wasn't real thrilled about giving up my car, but my wife wasn't the least bit concerned. After 20 minutes of long hallways, conference rooms, escalators ( all carrying the wore out 2 year old, I gave up since we hadn't seen a sole, parked my self and both grand sons on the floor in one of the halls and decided to let the zombies come get me. The wife went ahead and returned after what felt like a very lengthy time with our room number.I room was clean and comfortable, shower was spotless as was the rest of the bathroom. My only complaint was the heat. The digital thermostat claimed it was on 70 but it sure didnt feel like 70. I set it at 72 and we decided to chill for awhile watching some kids show.After two hours or so we decided to live it large and go to the rain forest cafe, on the way out the door I cranked the heat to 76. When we returned I again really didnt think the heat had changed much, I decided that I would leave the thermostat set at at 76 for the rest of the night. I awoke about 3 am, to find the room was warm ( not hot), if I was a guessing man I would say closer to 72. I pulled the covers back over the kids, turned the thermostat back to 72 and went back to bed.If I was a guessing man I would say that the heat wasn't going to go higher than a certain point ( degree) no matter how high the thermostat was set. I don't think the room got warmer that 72.Other than that I found everyone to be very friendly, everything was very clean, the beds and the pillows were soft. Just use the front door and let them park your car."
definitely not family friendly. our room was too close to the elevators ... very noisy at night. no mini-fridge or microwaves in rooms for between meal snacksroom service slow and inapt. ordered 2 pizza's at 8pm. 1 of them was delivered at 10:30pm. Called down to room service inform them of the error. Was told that they would send it right up. It never came. We ended up calling them back at midnight to cancel the order.disappointed in my stay overall :(
"The amenities were fabulous!!! The bed was very comfortable! The main hotel staff were very professional and friendly. I absolutely enjoyed my time there. The only problem was in the Aria bar/lounge area. It was understaffed, the waitress I had was working hard but she failed to seat us and had a little attitude when asked to clean a table for us to be seated as Allllllll the available tables were soiled with plates and utensils. After finally being sated she failed to give us utensils even after bringing the meal, plus she was not pleasant. To top it off the food was not the best tasting and the portion was not worth the exorbitant amount of money paid. Disappointed there as I am a foodie!!! Hotel is great!! Just eat somewhere else."
"Overall, this hotel was excellent: quiet atmosphere; polite and friendly service; spacious and clean rooms with modern, convenient furnishings and amenities; comfortable bed with good linens; and within reasonable walking distance (15 minutes) of several restaurants and shopping venues. In-room food service was on time and tasty. The wi-fi network was fast and complimentary under the conference group rate that...

"I had two gripes. The first was a dirty bed throw. They fixed that immediately and were apologetic. The second was that the rooms look a bit tired. This hotel just didn't live up to my experience staying at the Fairmonts on the west coast.The best part about any Fairmont is the people. They do hire some of the best you can find and so I don't blame them as much as I blame the actual property owners. The restaurant staff was especially good and the food was always terrific. I was there for a little over a week and I was pleased with the service.

"From the moment that we stepped out of our car and were met by the valet, I knew that this was going to be a great experience. The valet was pleasant and efficient. The check in process was welcoming and without problem. Our room on the 19th floor(1916) was spacious with two double beds. There were three windows and a great view of the street and buildings below. The beds were super comfy and the room was updated with modern decor. My favorite thing about the room, besides the view were the bathrobes provided with the linens in the bathroom. The conceirge was helpful and very patient with our questions. We were so close to the Museum of Art and shopping on the Miracle Mile. We enjoyed being welcomed back by the valets at the front door."
"We have stayed at this hotel the last three times visiting Chicago and yet have had a single complaint. My husband and I do not take exceptional customer service for granted anymore these days and the folks at this hotel deliver it (this is coming from someone who has worked in the restaurant service industry for 25 years). As a side note, the doormen are extremely friendly and helpful. Everything they suggested was a hit with us and certainly added to all the fun we had."
"Chicago has so many new luxury hotels, you would think it would be hard for the ""oldies"" to keep up. Having stayed recently at both the Fairmont Millennium Park and the Ritz Carlton, I honestly believe that what you may sacrifice in terms of modern amenities, you make up for in the overall quality of the experience. The Fairmont's concierge went out of her way to help us find a needle in a haystack, and came through with flying colors. Here, the staff really makes the difference. If there's something you want or need (even if it's just an extra ice bucket), you will get it. Quickly.If high ceilings and ultra-modern lobbies aren't crucial to you, the 5-star Chicago hotel experience is available at what some might consider ""bargain"" rates. Take it!"
"Loved the view of our second room and loved that we could walk to and from the train stations, navy pier, and millennium park. Everything is so close the problem was that our first room had blood smeared on the walls of the bathroom. Bad first impression at the least. Staff was happy to change our room but still felt dirty after seeing the bathroom of the first. Poor water pressure as well and towels feel like sandpaper."
Chicago was the last leg of our long holiday so it was so relieving to stay at such a nice hotel especially since we booked it as a mystery deal on expedia.Hotel is stunning. We checked in and went up to our room to realise we were given 2 double beds instead of a queen or king so we went to the front desk and they were more than happy to help and upgraded us to a massive lake view room with a king bed!Good location. Super helpful staff. Great facilities (fitness centre was good!)Only negative was that weirdly enough they don't provide free in-room wifi and if you do choose to pay its pretty overpriced. However they do have free wifi in the lobby.Definitely would stay again but unfortunately wasn't impressed with Chicago as a city so don't see us coming back anytime soon
"This hotel is in a great location, great views, and a good hotel overall. Wewanted a great room for a holiday getaway with friends, and the Fairmont was the only one in the area that had a suite with adjoining bedroom, perfect to hang out in, but still plenty of privacy. Perfect location to do all the ""downtown things"" you want. A few small issues that kept it from being up to par with the excellence I would expect from a Fairmont, but nothing that made it terrible. We will definitely stay here again."
"From the moment I checked in and Morgan at the front desk greeted me with a smile and made sure I was happy and had everything I needed through the time I checked out of my exquisite room, everything at this hotel exceeded my expectations. I didn't book the Presidential Suite but Morgan made me feel like I was the most important guest in the hotel and that is a great feeling which can just get your stay off on the right foot. When the staff continues to exceed your expectations that has a way of keeping you happy the entire time. I have visited Chicago about a dozen times and this was my first time at the Fairmont. I can't wait to return."
"Our weekend in Chicago was enhanced with a stay at the Fairmont Millennium Park. The price was right for a wonderful room. The stay got off to an outstanding beginning as we were greeted by Morgan at check in. She was bright and energetic and her welcomed us back to the city and Fairmont as we have stayed at the hotel in the past but due to family situations hadn't been downtown for several years. Morgan gave my wife and I a feeling that this was going to be a special time. She reminded us of things that would be interesting to do and we had an excellent chat as she efficiently and quickly checked us in. In fact, we found all hotel personal to be exceedingly friendly and helpful. We were very pleased and will be making a return visit to the Fairmont soon.Mark M

"We stayed at the Fairmont over the weekend...our second stay at this hotel. We visit Chicago often and have used at least 15 different hotels over the years -- our decision is usually based on who has the best price for a four-star hotel and in this case the price was exceptional. (The hotel is also close to the Art Institute and our son's neighborhood.) No complaints about the front desk reception, the quality of the restaurant breakfast, or the free wi-fi for President's Club members.But as several other reviews have noted, this hotel is tired and lacking in the kind of detail that you expect from this brand. The $60 million renovation is visible in the lobby, but not in the rooms. More attention to detail would mean that the bedside lights would have been dusted, that there was more than one washcloth or bar of soap in the bathroom (which features separate shower and tub), that there were two robes for guests' use instead of just one, that there was a complimentary bottle of water (instead of a $10 bottle of Evian), and so forth. Stay at one of the many comparable options in Chicago and you'll see where the Fairmont is lacking. p.s. if President's Club members can request a pillow preference ahead of time (in our case, foam instead of down), would it kill the Fairmont Chicago to provide this option?

"There is certainly no shortage of hotel rooms in downtown Chicago, but few can match the size and refinement of those at the Fairmont. Don't be fooled by the lackluster exterior of the building -- this is a luxury hotel. The lobby is understated and elegant, not loud and bustling. My room was extremely large by major city standards, and the bathroom was truly exceptional. I had an incredible view of Lake Michigan and loved the sitting area next to the large windows. I really did not want to leave.Location of the hotel is ideal, as you are very close to Michigan Ave -- but not too close. You're also a very short walk to The Loop, The Pritzker Pavilion, and the Art Institute. Slightly more expensive than other large hotels in the area, but worth it.

"Prior to traveling to Chicago I read several reviews and found that all of the negative ones are incorrect or at least were when I arrived at the hotel. I found the staff to be extremely friendly and helpful as well as the room to be beautiful (with an amazing view). I would stay at the Fairmont Chicago again if I return. Aria is a nice place to have a drink and the Canadian pizza was amazing. The prices were not outrageous in the restaurant like in a lot of places. It is conveniently located to the downtown area and I thoroughly enjoyed my experience. The only negative comment I have is that it is across the street from a fire station which is extremely loud. That is to be expected, though. I live in a very rural area in my town so it was probably more disturbing to me than it would be to someone who lives in the city or in a town."
"I travel every week and chose the Fairmont Chicago because we are hosting an event here in Jan 2015. Our room was right sized; easy to move around, bathroom was upscale and nice, and the bed was great. I did not interact with the staff much, but when I did they were professional. Check out the beautiful city park just east of the hotel. Enjoy the open lobby bar and the quiet location. We will be back in January with a bunch of customers and the visit will be great.

"I spent a night on a business trip at the Fairmont Millennium Park in Chicago. And it was a night well spent!First, the disclaimer: it's a couple blocks from Millennium Park. Still, it's eminently walkable, so there are no points against on that matter!Second, I thought about titling the review: Not over-the-top elegant, but well above really good. Nothing was ""Oh my gosh, this is the most luxurious XYZ I've ever had in a hotel!"" but nothing was noticeably mid-grade, either.As you would expect with the Fairmont brand, the hotel is generally upscale. This one looks recently renovated, but not ""new,"" exactly. It's not old, it just didn't convey that ""Hey, we're new, so be careful with us!"" vibe -- which was a good thing! The decor was modern without being offputting or avant garde; fun without being informal; elegant without being opulent.My room was a standard, king room. The room itself was not very large, but it was laid out well. The bathroom was spacious, with a separate toilet room, as well as bathtub and a separate shower. The shower stall was very nice -- all stone tiles. Bath amenities were lovely, and the towels were nice and soft.The bed was beautiful -- nice and firm -- but the pillows win the prize. So very often, pillows are the last thing a hotel thinks about, and that's never a good thing. These pillows were all wonderful -- different grades of down pillows, from very firm to medium. The sheets were nice.The view from my 22nd floor room was spectacular; I had an east-facing room, so in addition to the marvelous architecture of the Aqua tower building and a lovely little park, there were views of Lake Michigan. I could see Millennium Park just to the south, and my view actually took me all the way across Grant Park to the Field Museum. Very nice!My group registration gave me free internet access in the room; I don't know if this was unusual, or not. Both wired and wi-fi were available. I did see mention that internet access was ""available for purchase,"" but I don't know if they're moving to free wi-fi or not. The wi-fi was good, but it was a pain having to re-register every time after closing my laptop for an hour during sessions befire reconnecting.I did not sample the restaurant, although my conference did allow me to have a continental breakfast and a served lunch. Both were very tasty.The location makes this a great place to walk around downtown Chicago. You're just a few blocks from Navy Pier, Millennium Park, the Loop, and the Tribune Tower/Wrigley Building, which are the start of the Magnificent Mile. It's really very convenient!One last warning: given that this is an upscale hotel, parking is pricey. My group rate for the conference was a really quite reasonable $179 a night (that's outstanding, in this neck of the woods!), but the overnight valet parking was another $65. Ouch. All in all, though, this is a very fine hotel. Enjoy!

"I spend one night in this hotel and got a great experience. Friendly reception, always willing to help, and they gave me a great room on the top floor. Spaceous room, great bed, large shower and a separate bath and toilet. The fitness has all equipment but has no windows which is not so nice (compared to the hotel opposite in the same street). The restaurant bar serves drinks and snacks that are OK, and the restaurant is fine. The breakfast buffet is not overwhelming but it was all I needed, and you can order anything else as an extra."
"I found the amenities at this hotel quite good, as well as the location. We were there on business and stayed on the ""Gold Floor"". The staff on the ""Gold Floor"" were not as friendly or accommodating as the other properties we have stayed at--it seemed as though unless you gave a 20 or 30 dollar tip, you were largely ignored. At the Chateau Frontenac, Queen Elizabeth, Royal York and Chateau Laurier properties I never felt obligated to tip and the staff ALWAYS went above and beyond for me.The breakfasts in the lounge were also the least exciting I have seen at a Fairmont--however, the selection in the evening was excellent. Also, there was one lounge attendant who constantly asked if I would like a glass of wine--every time I entered the lounge in the afternoon or evening. It was annoying and the other guests that I spoke with felt the same way. Asking once is fine, but if I say no, please don't ask me 3 more times.Although I am a Platinum Presidents Club member, next time I am in Chicago I will try a different hotel. Nothing was terrible, but nothing was extraordinary either."
"We stayed in Fairmont from Oct. 22-24. We were allowed to check in earlier (around 10:00 am) as per our request. The concierge booked our reservations in the Signature and the First Lady Architectural Tour (with suggestions on when we should go). He also suggested several nearby places where we can dine. The location of the hotel is just in between everything. It is possible to walk to Millenium/Grant Park, Navy Pier, Magnificent Mile and downtown. I really like the location of this hotel."
"The Fairmount Hotel in Chicago is a very nice choice if staying in Chicago. Just a block away from the Mag mile the rooms are nice and the beds very comfortable. It is a little pricey but remember you are in Chicago-so all the hotels that are worth staying in are going to be a little more money. But-you want to be comfortable-and the room was very quiet. We were on the 36th floor and had a beautiful view. The people at the front desk were very nice and professional and if you join their Presidents club which is free you get free Wi-Fi. We enjoyed our stay and wouldstay here again when in Chicago-Very close to Mag mile shopping but a block away so you don't get all the noise. Good airport access to Midway-a little further to O'Hare.

"The Fairmont Chicago is in a great location for getting to the Art Institute and Michigan Avenue. It is a block or two ""off the beaten path"" but also a block or two from Michigan Avenue, the river tours, and a half mile or less to shopping and eating experiences. The staff here is wonderful.

The only thing I could complain about the hotel is its paper thin wall (as least for the room I was staying at).

That was pretty frustrating because I needed a good rest for the next day's interview."

"My wife and I travelled to Chicago for the first time for a romantic weekend. It was a busy weekend as we went during the Chicago Marathon. We decided to stay at the Fairmont as it was recommended to us by a friend. I wanted to make the trip a little special for my wife so we decided to upgrade to the gold level while checking in. It was a great a choice as we got more than what we were expecting. The rooms were amazing and the atmosphere in lounge was nice and relaxing which was exactly what we needed. The food offerings in the lounge were top notch as well and well spread out through the day. The best part was the service. I was presently surprised as the staff were probably the best i have encountered at any hotel. They really made you feel like VIP from the checking in process to any further assistance you required, The Manager's name was Murtaza who took excellent care of us and was there for anything we needed. He helped us out with the city tours and with great suggestions for eating out and entertainment. he suggested going to the red head piano bar which was a great hit and a definite spot for anyone to check out. We mentioned his name and they really took care of us even at the bar! The rest of the staff was great as well all the way down to the servers. I had an amazing weekend with my wife and would definitely return for the service and hospitality.

"I was at the Fairmont for a conference in October 2014. The hotel is wonderful and the rooms very well appointed. The location is walking distance to many restaurants, shopping and sight seeing activities. I enjoyed the location of the hotel and the staff was very friendly. I have to say however, that just walking from my room to the elevator I had to bring a heavy sweater because the hallway was sooooo cold. I should have known that the meeting room would be worse. The meeting lasted from Thursday and Sunday and although I (and I think others) complained about how cold the meeting room was nothing seems to change. I honestly wanted to bring a blanket down from my rooms so I could sit in the meeting. I know the temperature is usually kept a little cool to keep people awake for all day meetings but this was ridiculous ... my fingers were frozen, all the women I could see had their coats and scarves on. I hope they learn to warm it up a couple of degrees! My other complaint regarding the meeting was the food, the breakfast was generally all right, nothing too spectacular but for breaks all they had was coffee, tea, pop or water and heaven forbid you head out to get a coffee one minute after the meeting started because it was already whisked away! So for a meeting I think they need to do some work, to stay and see Chicago it is a very nice hotel with a restaurant within and a nice bar and coffee shop in the lobby.

"I stayed here one night before flying on to Italy. The main lobby area was very large and cold feeling. I would say it was designed with minimal decor and modern. The staff were nice and helpful. My room was very spacious and decorated nicely, but modern, so it wasn't cozy or unique in any way. The bed was very comfortable with nice linens. Bathroom was very clean, lots of space, and decent lighting. Ordered room service twice - food was good and came relatively quickly. I would say overall though, it was just okay. For the price, I expected more - perhaps a unique feeling instead of it feeling like an industrial space."
"This hotel is perfectly located, near of Millenium Park and the Magnificent Mile. We were there during the weekend of the Chicago Marathon. Employees were welcoming back runners with a bottle of water and a towel. We were able to use the facilities of the Gold Room and the lounge was open at 5:00 AM to accommodate the runners for their pre-race breakfast. And believe me the needs of all the runners were totally satisfied in terms of food and beverages. Personal is courteous and they all seem to be happy to work for Fairmont Chicago. This is a great hotel!

"Beautiful location and gorgeous interior of the hotel. Great for a meeting, which was the main reason I attended. Some of the rooms have been updated and others have not. Would say that I would like to see the rest of the place get updated. Stayed in an older room and didn't feel that amongst all the other hotels in Chicago that for the price I paid it was the experience I was receiving. Front desk and bellmen could not have been more helpful and nice! They were always a highlight to every day."
"The rooms seem tired. Most of the fixtures in our bathroom were loose. The shampoo and other bathroom products were not replaced until the next to last day of our 5 day stay even though the empties had been put in the trash. The bed was very uncomfortable with a big trough in the middle. Even though I made the reservation 6 months in advance they were unable to provide me with the kind bed room I had reserved.The bathroom near the conference room had dings and broken toilet paper holders. The conference room was freezing. The highlights of our stay were the concierge staff who were outstanding! They were very helpful, accommodating, friendly and went above and beyond wha was expected. I can't praise them enough but they might not be enough to justify the expense of a stay at the Fairmont.

"I attended a business conference at the Fairmont in early October 2014. After reading some of the relatively recent negative reviews on this site, I was very skeptical and debated staying at another hotel even though the conference was at the Fairmont. I'm so glad I stayed at the Fairmont! Contrary to what the negative reviews say: (1) The check in experience was wonderful and took -- quite literally -- three minutes. (2) The staff members were very helpful and friendly. (3) The room was very clean -- and I am more particular than most on the cleanliness issue. I would definitely stay here again."
"Really good location (5min walk from the cloud gate) and the magnificent mile. Lobby area impressive with staff willing to help out in any way they can. Hotel provides for a lot of conferences and had the joy of some rather drunk conference goers knocking on our door one night as they couldn't remember their room number, other than that the Only other draw back was the room itself,while spacious it was dated and I think for the cost you could find better."
"My husband and I stayed at the Fairmont for the second time in a year and contrary to our visit last November (2013), our one night stay this past September was just awesome. The atmosphere, the staff, everything was simply wonderful. The bellman who assisted us with our luggage was most pleasant and accommodating. We had no problems checking in early and our suite was just perfect with absolutely gorgeous views of the lake and Millennium Park. Although our visit back to Chicago was not planned and due to the untimely and unexpected passing of a family member, our stay at the Fairmont was just the thing my husband and I needed before heading back home. All the staff we were in contact with (reservations, bellman, doorman) were professional and welcoming. Whenever we need to be in Chicago, we'll definitely stay at the Fairmont again."
"Stayed for 3 nights on business in a King room with a lake view. Gorgeous room! Modernly decorated, enough seating for guests, nice vanity area just outside the bathroom. Bathroom was very large with a beautiful tiled shower, separate bath tub, plenty of counterspace. A safe in the room and a refrigerator (very little usable space due to all of the drinks they try to sell you). The air conditioning unit was whisper quiet - I was impressed. I was quite comfortable here for my entire stay. Large window for plenty of natural light. Join the President's Club (free) for free internet. Access was spotty but when it worked, it was fine. The lobby and ballroom floors are beautiful. One thing I liked about the hotel is its unusual shape (floor plan). All rooms are close to the elevators - no long hallways to walk down. Nice.The staff here are very accommodating. The bell service, front desk service, and housekeeping all exceeded my expectations. One minor annoyance - business center is not 24/7 and charges 55 cents per minute for general computer use. I needed to print a Word document and it would have cost me money to do so. Printing boarding passes is free though, if that's all you need to do.If I come back to Chicago with my family, I'll probably stay somewhere else. While this hotel is beautiful, I feel that there are other area hotels with a better price point. On the other hand, if my employer sends me to Chicago again (and pays for it), I'll happily stay again!


Room Tip: The higher the floor, the less street noise you will have.

Green Features: Very eco-friendly. The typical signs in the room about changing linens and towels only when needed, bu there were also signs in the public restrooms urging guests to use the new high-efficiency hand dryers instead of paper towels."
"My daughter and I shared a mother/daughter long weekend at Fairmont enjoying the unprecedented service and attention we received as guests in Fairmont Gold room and the 15th floor Gold Lounge. Great&insightful recommendations, prompt bookings, the ease of it all etc.

"My 37th floor room had a great view. It was large, clean and had a comfortable bed. Check-in and check out were quick. The elevators were fast. One day I had the $29 breakfast buffet and it was delicious! Scrambled eggs, three different meats, lots of fruit and pastries. Three weeks ago I stayed at the Fairmont Mayakoba in Mexico and this hotel in Chicago does not compare with it at all. At this location, there was no turn down service, no french press coffee maker, no shower cap and no small fridge. Chicago was very disappointing after getting spoiled in Mexico. A CVS drug store is across the street which helped since there were no vending machines for snacks/sodas. Taxi cabs were always available. Concierge printed out my boarding pass free. I would recommend this hotel. It is located downtown and easy to walk to the great shopping areas on State Street."
"The sad thing is that the fairmont brand is a top notch brand with hard working employees and a nice history. The problem is this hotel. The entire checkin front desk staff is rude, smug, and most of all, lacks any sort of customer service skills that can't be taught to a robot. My room was not cleaned (probably an oversight) but I mentioned it. Without apology or real resolve, while checking out the head of the bell desk in fact, just kind of moved on to charging me and giving me a fake smile. There were parties in the hotel rooms (I heard on my floor) famous porn stars (in the lobby w a camera crew) drunks and what looked like an escort sizing me up at the bar. So when I asked the question: why don't you guys include wifi in the rate, the smug gentleman smiles and says: well sir. Most luxury hotels don't. I looked at him and did not think to have to justify myself but the audacity to assume I a) don't stay in luxury usually b) but to just explain it a bit nicer wouldn't have been hard would have? This is the worst hotel experience I have ever had. Period. Awful. Dirty hotel and terrible front desk staff. As for the valet and bell desk: very very nice and helpful."

"I was expect a better service from the fairmont hotel, but this one just delivered average service. The wait time to check in is a bit long due to the people checked in prior to us was complain about they didn't get the room they asked for. When we are checking in, there is no apology about the wait time. I understand is not their fool, but at least try to be polite about it. The room was great, great size, nice and clean. Bed is a bit too soft, but still really comfortable. Second day when we check out, it took no time to check out. They didn't even ask how was my stay, just check me out. Which is another minus. And the bell desk person is a bit impolite when we want to store our luggages, it's not the word he said just the attitude when he is doing his job.Overall, the stay is ok, the hotel deliver what it should deliver. And nothing special about it. Great location with great price. But just ok service.


Room Tip: There is supermarket just around the corner which open till mid-night.

I was in Chicago on business for 3 days. The last time I was at this hotel I was very disappointed. I switched rooms twice because of dingy-ripped carpet and dirty bathrooms. I was pleasantly surprised this visit. The first room I received was very clean. The bed was very comfortable as well as the pillows. The bathroom was impeccable. No mold. This is very important to me. The water pressure was good. The AC works very well. They also have air purifiers in each room. The location is excellent. Short walk to Madison Avenue. The food was very good I ordered both breakfast and dinner from room service. I would definitely recommend this hotel.
"This hotel is well well run, polite helpful staff. The rooms are clean and maintained. The beds are excellent. The hotel is in the centre of town and you can walk to all attractions and shopping. I would stay here again , it is not over the top luxury but very easy to live in .


Room Tip: all locations are ok here no outside noise

"This hotel was elegant and modern,clean, and comfortable! The room was quiet, well-appointed, had numerous outlets on the desk for charging electronics, a large bathroom and a comfortable bed. I especially liked the new fitness center and the Chicago Market where you could get not only Starbucks coffee and pastries, but cereal, yogurt, and fresh whole fruit. The conference meeting...

"Have stayed here several times due to events, including just this past weekend. Clearly built on business model of conferences, conventions, and mass production. Unfortunately, even with known events, things like parking get very backed up (plan an extra 20+ minutes to park during a big event, whether valet or self-park), although there was staff around everywhere. Rooms are basic...

"With wide open spaces and strategically places conversational clusters throughout, the Hyatt Regency Chicago is a convention/business meeting dream. Multiple meeting and convention spaces make size an afterthought while late-night offerings and socializing at Big Bar make you feel like you are at a trendy club rather than a hotel bar. The rooms scream new modern with dark furnishings and...

"Spent an anniversary weekend in downtown Chicago and chose the hyatt regency, definitely the correct pick!Having platinum status helps, from checki-in to calling ahead for reservations, Hyatt wil hook you up. We were upgraded to the 35th floor regancy club and had champagne and strawberries waiting for us in the room when we returned.Parking downtown at the hotel was $60, but the night lights and room made up for it!


Room Tip: The city view is nice. Not sure the regency club upgrade is worth the price.

"the hotel is right downtown and couldn't be more central, right on the river and not far from the lake side. Rooms are clean and large. Biggest problem is that it is quite expensive - you are paying for the location for sure. I had a corporate rate of 280USD per night and this did not include breakfast or wifi or taxes. I upgraded to a wifi + breakfast deal at check in. The check in staff were great by the way. The problem was for the 2 days I was there the queue for breakfast was so long that I gave up, even though I had pre-paid effectively."
"If your visit requires sleep, internet access, or a clean modern room, then this property is perfect for you. It is a large, noisy, poorly kept facility. The staff is very nice, and the location is great, however as one of Hyatt's foundation, even with the renovation of public spaces, as a loyal Diamond level guest, I am sorry to say, it is way off the mark. All three nights we stayed at this property we were woken up by noisy neighbors, or very chatty housekeepers in the hall. Insist on a non-connecting room if you must stay at this property. It is a convention hotel, however that does not excuse their poor performance. I brought these complaints to managements attention as they took place, and while they did not dispute any of my observations they did comp a night and a lunch, however I was not looking to negotiate a deal. On the basis of meeting basic requirements, that being a clean, noise free, functional facility, they failed to meet the standards. I tried several times to talk directly to the manager Patrick Donelly, and he would not take or return my call. This property plays the odds on receiving multiple complaints and in all honesty I do not believe they really care. We support Hyatt on a global basis and this property is an enigma however as this area has many similar hotels, my recomendation is to avoid it.

"We found this hotel from a no-named hotel deal and stayed for three nights with a very reasonable price. Hyatt Regency has a great location. Almost everywhere you'll visit in Chicago is in walking distance. Rooms are large and very clean. Beds are pretty comfortable. There are some restaurants, a bar and a 24 hours open cafe under it. We just used the cafe and didn't try others but they were pretty busy. The biggest problem I experienced with this hotel was checkin and checkout process. Systems are pretty slow, checkin process took pretty long. Same for self service checkout. Also, some of the elevators do not work which causes long wait times for the guests. Overall, we enjoyed our stay."
"Had the pleasure of traveling to the Windy City on business and booked this excellent Hyatt property. We decided it would be better to stay in and went to the bar area to have a few drinks. They had a nice selection of wines and beers. While winding down we observed the buffet being set up. I am not much of a buffet connoisseur anymore so I was watching and thinking room service is happening. The aroma was inviting so I went over and walked through. Wow what a pleasant suprise, excellent presentation of both healthy and ""comfort"" style food was available. Fresh salads and desserts. Very top shelf and delicious. The diamond-platinum rooms wings were quiet, comfortable and clean. Very professional staff. Highly recommended if you want to stay close to the airport and to the car rental agencies."
"Stayed at the hotel for 6 days for work. The hotel is big and busy. Front desk staff ate efficient and friendly. Very good location. The rooms are furnished nicely although getting a little dated. On the negative side the cleaning staff need some work an empty bottle and dirty glass was beside my bed for my entire stay --- i kept hoping this will be the day they take it. I had a connected room to mine and the i could hear everything (everything) going on in their room was annoying.The lounge/restaurant on the bottom floor was very disappointing...dirty glasses on the table, cutlery not clean. But the worst was the service i tried to wave down a server to get help for 15 minutes to no avail. Meanwhile the bartender stared right at me and did nothing. This was at 2 pm so he was not busy mixing drinks. Finally so frustrated i just walked out."
"My wife and I were here for a conference in the adjoining convention center, and for that the location was excellent. The hotel itself was about what you'd expect for a hotel of the Hyatt Regency class, which put it at Very Good, but it didn't have quite the extra pizazz that would have brought the rating up to the ultimate Excellent. On the plus side, for those attending a convention here in February, as we did, and not wanting to brave blustery Chicago weather, there are sufficiently many dining choices (many admittedly fast food places) that can be reached without going outside to make dining something other than an exercise in terror."
"The Hyatt Regency is a spectacular stay right in the heart of downtown Chicago, and located just blocks from Lake Michigan and Millennium Park. You can tell it's a sleek, business friendly hotel as soon as you walk in. From the BIG Bar (which was very impressive), to the two different sit-down restaurants located on the main level, and the corner market...this hotel has everything you could possibly want/need. The gym is fantastic and surprisingly big. The beds were the BEST of any hotel I've slept at before; just so soft and fluffy. The only terrible thing about this hotel is that PARKING is $60/night...yes $60. And that fee is not included in your rate, so be sure to add it on nightly. Otherwise, this Hyatt is a great stay!"
