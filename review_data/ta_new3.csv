"We were attending a day-time conference at the Field Museum, with a dinner to follow, so we decided to stay ""in-town"". The Hilton was a great choice; mainly for location, but it turned out to be great all the way around. Outstanding service from folks who actually seemed to be enjoying their jobs. Everyone from the valet to the bartenders were pleasant and caring.

"Stayed at this hotel for a conference. It was very large and quite busy. Lots of elevators which made it easy to get from floor to floor. The most expensive rooms are quite lovely especially on T3 and T4. They have fabulous views of the lake. All of the staff seemed quite friendly and willing to assist whenever needed.


Room Tip: The beds are vey comfortable but get a room away from the elevators.

"Rooms were fine; beds were good; room was not as clean as I would expect for the price. Dusting is not high on their list of priorities in cleaning the room. As a HHonors member, I expected some perks but there were none. There was a charge to use the exercise room, for storing luggage from checkout until time to leave for airport, for use of wifi - they provide a nice computer in the room but the only thing it was just an annoyance because the monitor came on without any assistance early in the morning. There is no turn-down service, no chocolate on your pillow. So if you are looking for an expensive hotel with a good bed and clean sheets, this is the place to go.

"Perfect location for parks, museums, and convention center but still convenient to the shopping on the Magnificent Mile. This was my second trip to Chicago in 3 weeks so I wasn't too excited about the return. This hotel on this side of the River gave me a completely different visit. Great staff and location. Be prepared because the hotel has been left in its dated state and there are some good and bad things about this. I loved the old feel, but there are some places where they need to check tattering and the rooms for wear and tear. The very large sitting areas on each floor are so amazing and distinctive to this hotel. The place is just beautiful in a dated way. I stayed here 14 years ago with my daughter in the same type of two bathroom room and not much had changed. This hotel is great if you need to get to the convention center or museum area. There are many great places to eat within walking distance.


Room Tip: Try to get a full view room.

"For a 100 year old building in Chicago, this one is in great shape. The rooms were large and some even had 2 bathrooms. The staff were great and were always willing to answer any questions we had. The dining options were also great. You could grab a quick bite to eat or have nice dining experiences in one of their onsite restaurants. The location was also very convenient to many of the great Chicago landmarks."
"Booked a room last minute at the Hilton, as the hotel I stayed had terrible service - wifi was down for 2 days straight, and they even nearly lost one of my couriers. Moved out to the Hilton, which was slightly cheaper - but charged a whopping $450+ because it was conference season.The room was run down and tired, and I reckon I was handed one of the rooms that hadn't been refurbished yet. Not a problem, but the least they could do is not charge top dollar for a rather poor quality room. The wallpaper was peeling off the wall, the paint on the door was chipped, and the room was awfully noisy! Oh, and they had this old PC in the room which I believe was from the time when Spock was still young and alive.I reckon I won't stay here again till I've had a chance to see their new refurbished rooms, because I reckon I overpaid 2-3 times what the room should have been worth. Even during conference season.


Room Tip: Ask for a refurbished room

"The hotel is over 90 years old and is a true heritage The rooms are renovated ad used to have more than 3,000 ad after renovation, rooms have been enlarged and total count is 1,500. Rooms are in good condition and well maintained. Also the rooms are cleaned well. Service at the front desk could be improved though. Breakfast in the Executive Floor Lounge is very simple and also service at breakfast at the All Day Dining could be bette too. The location is good rigth at city center."
"I stayed here for one Saturday night. The check-in process was good because I used the Hilton honors line. I had a room on the executive level with two beds and two bathrooms. Had a great view of lake Michigan. I didn't take advantage of all the services that the hotel had to offer such as free refreshments, free continental breakfast, concierge, etc. Great location. Staff was friendly too. Can't think of anything to complain about."
"We stayed here for a national professional meeting. It seemed a little expensive until we used the facilities. They were worth it. Our suite was spectacular and the fitnesses area would rival the best health club. The morning buffett was the best I have had in any hotel, including chef made omelets, multiple very fresh fruit and baked goods. The staff was top notch and midwest friendly. And it was walking distance to the Shedd Aquarium, Field Museum and the Planetarium (Soldier's Field was a short cab ride away). The facility is gorgeous--so if you don't mind the price, this is a GREAT place to stay.

"I just came back from a convention held the the Hilton. I had a special rate: almost 300$ per night. Reception is fast. The room was large overlooking beautiful Lake Michigan. It needed a bit revamping and a more imaginative designer. WiFi is not free unlike most other hotels I have been to. No free WiFi in 2015 is almost like having to pay for the towells. By the way, the towells will soon need to be replace! No bathrobe. Shampoo and a bar of soap. That's it. Even no QTips! No slippers. Mini bar was a warm not working fridge. But the worst was the eating at this hotel. There is not one reason to serve so low quality of food in such an hotel.. And no reason either for having to wait in a line of 20+ people to pay at the Herb N' Kithchen where they have the Starbuck! Good meeting facilities.

"This is a hotel with glorious history and managed by the famus Hilton group. I am disappointed to stay that their standard did not live up to my expectation .Rooms a spacious but old. Internet connection is valuable in lobby only, if you wish to get online in your room, you have to pay an expensive price for the wifi. Breakfast is ok but again very expensive. Overall, it is quite disappointing. An grade ""C+"" experience."
"We stayed at the Chicago Hilton for 5 nights. Our first time ever in Chicago. The room was a little small - actually I think it was too much furniture for the room. Beautiful but dated. There were several volleyball teams there and yet the halls were so quiet. The food line in the morning is ridiculously long and its the same line for Starbucks. Almost better to walk down the street to a different coffee shop. We loved the proximity to restaurants, parks, and major attractions. We felt the prices were very affordable. Definately will stay again.

"We'd stayed here once maybe 10 years ago and it was fine, if not sufficiently memorable to bring us back, but we figured it would suffice for our recent 3-night business trip. We could not have been more wrong. If I provide all relevant details this review will extend for pages, so I will restrict myself to highlights. First, this hotel has airline-like policies, so if you want to go to the gym or use wifi or receive a package, you are nickled and dimed. Forget about dropping off a package outside of normal business hours - the front desk, concierge and security staff all indicated that someone from the other department was responsible for holding packages (even prepaid packages complete with UPS label), with the end result that I took my UPS package to NY on a plane and delivered it in person. Not what you'd expect of a hotel that markets itself as good for business. Second, the hotel feels like it specializes in catering to shady characters. The renovation that occurred between our prior and recent stays succeeded in erasing all charm remaining in this former grand dame hotel, resulting in a style I'd call ""cheap roadside motel generic."" My husband and I arrived separately, but the front desk refused to give my husband a second key or to earmark one for me. Rather, they had to ""see me in person,"" which meant I had to stand in the interminable checkin line even though we were checked in to pass visual inspection. And, when we ordered drinks in the lounge one evening, the waitress said she was not allowed to bring my drink while I was in the ladies room - she had to see me in order to put it down. I don't indulge in any fantasies that we appear rowdy or suspicious or like troublemakers - we are quiet, rule-abiding people clearly several decades past age 21 - but we were meant to feel like we were trying to sneak around somehow. The bed, itself comfortable, featured a bare duvet sandwiched loosely between two sheets, and we kept waking up with the naked duvet on our skin. I saw no evidence on the housekeeping carts that these are laundered between guests. UGH. Finally, our first room was ""sick."" It is true that the front desk clerk did not himself experience the miasma, but it was confirmed by an engineer, and we were clearly disoriented and sick when we finally presented ourselves at the front desk. The clerk had told us when we called down that no other rooms were available, and that the only option was for housekeeping spray the room with odor-masking chemicals, so we prepared ourselves to find another hotel on our own - by now it was well after midnight. When the clerk realized we were ready to decamp, he magically found another room in the hotel. He did reduce our room rate for that one night by half, which we had not asked for and did appreciate, but given that we were fearful for our health or worse (I had always viewed the phrase ""overcome by fumes"" with some skepticism, but never again), and he clearly thought we were being alarmist, the whole response seemed weak and reluctant. Honestly, though, I feel like this particular incident could have happened everywhere. I would not have rated our experience ""terrible"" had the other issues not presented themselves, especially the complete lack of even a show of interest of trying to help me solve my package issue. However, given the entire picture, at a minimum we will never return to this hotel, and more likely we will not patronize any Hilton-branded property again save for under duress.

"My husband and I have just returned from our first trip to Chicago and everything from the city to the hotel was magnificent!We felt extremely welcome from the moment we arrived, staff were very friendly and our room on the 25th floor was wonderful! Hotel location was ideal and very easy to get around the city from, plus hotel facilities were great.Didn't manage to get all staff members names but porters were especially helpful as well as Robert the Executive floor manager.When we return to Chicago this will be our first choice of hotel!"
"My family had our spring ""staycation"" here. It's right across from Lake Michigan and is a short walk to the Museum Campus (Field Museum, Shedd Aquarium, Adler Planetarium). This hotel is huge, but has an intimate feel. It's big, grand and beautiful, but not pretentious. Every staff person we interacted was with was friendly and helpful (especially those folks at the front desk). They make you feel like a special guest. A neat feature about this hotel is the rooms with dual baths, which is really nice for families or groups of two or more. The breakfast buffet was excellent. I don't say this often, but our stay here was perfect.

"Extremely disappointed by my two-night stay at this clearly tired property. My room was dated, the double bed lumpy, the wi-fi spotty (if even present...), the bathroom small, the HVAC maybe or maybe not actually connected, the outside HVAC equipment loud, the ""Irish"" bar inauthentic, the ""gift"" of two waters as a Hilton Honors guest not necessarily that generous...On the plus side, great location, and it's cool that it has 14 elevators.

"The Hilton Chicago is a classic, historically significant hotel. As such, one cannot expect the most spacious rooms.There's not many rooms that actually face the lake and provide a great view. I was fortunate enough to do some research and find one executive room that did, however, I had to resign myself to two double beds, as apparently king bed rooms do not face the lake.The space per room was not utilized well. The executive rooms lack any area for a laptop to be set up. The only 'desk area' is consumed by an aging pay-to-use computer terminal, which is completely and wholly unneeded considering the availability of laptops. These need to be ripped out to give actual desk space to the guest.The executive lounge was under renovation, and coupons were given for an appetizer and a continental breakfast downstairs, or $15 off food at one of their quick serve restaurants. My checkout process took well over 15 minutes, as an airline crew had check in priority at the Hilton Honors desk, as well as dealing with another party that could not procure an actual payment method for a room. This extended checkout meant I could not make it to the quick serve restaurant until 11:05AM, where they promptly refused to accept my coupon, despite food still being available.This is the first Hilton I've ever seen with a luggage check that charges money. I had a late afternoon train, so I asked to store luggage. The fee, $2, was cash only. I was told I could pay when I picked up my luggage, but the fee would now be $4. So much for a full service hotel.In the future I cannot foresee any reason to stay here when the Conrad Chicago is available, as well as the Hampton Inn/Homewood Suites, which are located in a much more central portion of Michigan Avenue.


Room Tip: Do research to find a room that has a view of the lake, if that's what you're looking for.

"Stayed at this hotel for spring break with the family. The location is incredible as it is on Michigan Avenue overlooking Lake Michigan itself. It is close to the loop and museums. The hotel has an amazing grand entrance. The check-in was a bit hard to find as you have to go past the entrance area to a smaller hallway further in and then head to the right but once we found it the staff were helpful and got us checked in promptly. We were upgraded to a room with a lake view and two bathrooms. The rooms were nice and felt spacious for a downtown hotel and the rate we paid which was very reasonable. The hotel had a chic feel to it that was very nice. It felt like it should be much more up-market that the price indicated. One downside is that the restaurants on site seem a bit limited. We had lunch and breakfast at the hotel. There is an Irish bar which we didn't try. Then there is a grab and go sort of place which we also didn't go to. The main restaurant across from the check-in was okay but nothing special. We had the breakfast buffet which was okay but nothing special and then a lunch. The chicken sandwich I had was okay but nothing special. With a lot of options in the neighborhood not having a great selection of restaurants in the hotel was not a big deal but it did feel like something was missing.We were happy with the hotel and I would definitely recommend it if you are looking to stay somewhere in the downtown area.


Room Tip: The lake view room we had was amazing on the 10th floor. Definitely worth it.

"I booked this hotel in 4 months and got an awesome rate. So we are off to a great start.From the moment I stepped in the hotel lobby, I experienced great service, from the valet to the cleaning staff. The lady (I think her name was April) who checked me in was AWESOME! She was really nice, conversational and provided excellent customer service. She upgraded my room to one with a view and all I can say is WOW! She put me on the 12th floor on Michigan Ave. Because this room is on the street, you do hear the traffic and the Metra trains across the street, but the view makes it worth it. I had a perfect view of Lake Michigan (watching the sunrise was bliss), Navy Pier and Solider Field.The hotel is about a 15-20 minute walk from The Cloud Gate (the ""bean""), Millennium Park and the Chicago Art Institute. The Museum of Contemporary Photography is a block away (they have a free exhibit on the Black Dandy until mid-July 2015). So it is a little further from the action, but the service and the view made up for that!The room was very clean and spacious. One small thing that put a little black mark on the review... they would not allow me to check out late for free at 3pm - the hotel was not fully booked. But they do offer bag storage for $2/bag.I loved this hotel and would definitely come back.

"I looked at many hotels (online, of course) as we were planning our spring break family getaway, but I chose the Hilton Chicago for a couple reasons. First, the location is great. We wanted to hit the museums as well as be within walking distance of Michigan Ave and other city attractions. We found all that in the Hilton. We were able to walk to the museums, Millennium Park (several times!) and to dinner each night. It also gave the kids a great taste of being in the big city - busy sidewalks, city lights - all the good stuff. :) Next, I like to keep my money, so I wanted a good deal. The ""Chillcation"" package at the Hilton gave us a few extras as well as included parking. Thank the gods! As someone who lives in the suburbs, paying Chicago prices for parking is painful. All in all, we were very happy with the Hilton. Our room was lovely and we were on a corner, so we had 3 windows. The view wasn't all that fantastic, but I didn't pay for a lake view, so I'm OK with that. Beds were comfy, plenty of shampoo/soap provided and even a computer in the room. Every employee we dealt with was competent and friendly. I'd definitely stay here again!"
"Close to museums, close to shoping area, close to downtown, close to Willis tower.Gor Chicago City Pass.In two days visited 4 museums, tower, did shopping, enjoyed Gino's East Pizza. Quiet place, clean, pool on 8th floor. For two days walked around 9am-9pm with two 8 years ols kids and they were never tired. Check in /out very easy.Will look again for low season prices in this hotel. There is much to see in Chicago and I feel we have seen only 30% of it.

"I loved this historic hotel from the moment I walked in. It is really beautiful, elegant and so remarkable if you consider how old it is. We arrived very early for our one night stay and were able to get in our room right away. There are a couple things worth noting. This hotel is not right in the heart of the shopping on Michigan Ave. If you do a day of heavy shopping, you'd probably want to take a cab back to the hotel especially if you're not a fan of walking about a half mile or so after being on your feet all day. It is near the park and offers good views of the lake and the museum campus. Although the hotel is historic, the rooms are modern. Our room with two double beds was spacious and had plenty of storage and closet space. The bathroom was not luxurious but sufficiently large. The furnishings were very comfortable. Our room was fairly quiet. We could hear some street noise but not enough to disturb our sleep.Parking is a big deal in Chicago and we took advantage of one of the packages the hotel was offering that included parking. The parking ramp is right behind the hotel and is easy to navigate. We enjoyed being able to walk out the door and cross the street to the park to go for a run in the morning. It's just a couple of blocks to the lake shore path if you want to run there."
"We stayed for 2 nights as we got married in Chicago. We had 3 rooms total and we were on floors 24,20 and 10 which was not convenient. This is a hotel for conventions, not families or romance. It is huge and not friendly. The room had a great view. Had to call 3 times for towels (took a total of 8 hours) and we should have had a small fridge in our room. Called for that and they said they could not put it where the fridge is supposed to go so it sat against the wall. Also if you want them to hold you luggage it is $2.00 per bag and on the 2nd floor. I have paid much less and stayed in much nicer hotels in Chicago. Not a friendly feel at all but a great view. Also the wi fi never worked and the computer system you are supposed to use for room service, entertainment etc...worked about 10% of the time."
"Wonderful hotel! Booked my room several months in advance so I got a really good rate.When I got there they upgraded us with no extra charge. The hotel was very clean. Stayed on an upper floor with a lake view. It was beautiful. All the staff were very friendly and helpful. The concierge was a great help with finding the correct buses to take. This is going to be my place to stay whenever I go to Chicago.

"We choice this hotel for a mini spring break trip and we're so happy with the selection! We were able to get a ""Chillcation"" package that was a good room rate, included parking ($55/day value), 20% hotel restaurants, free wifi and nice thermo mugs for free coffee/hot chocolate.The hotel lobby was beautiful and the entire building has a historical yet modern charm to it. We were upgraded to a double bathroom which was perfect for our family of 4. The room was a decent size and clean. The only thing missing amenity was a mini fridge.The hotel is within walking distance to the museum campus and not in such a heavily congestive area that its difficult to drive. This is much of the reason why we selected this part of town to stay in. The pool was the second driving factor because the kids love to swim and there isn't many options in Chicago (at least nice options). The pool was a lap pool and were satisfied but it wasn't really designed for their experience. The staff seemed to be patient with the influx of activity due to spring break. We had breakfast, a snack and a dinner at their on-site restaurants and all seemed to be decent selections. The staff was friendly and helpful throughout the entire stay.Overall, the stay was very nice and we would recommend the hotel to others. We even saw a ""celebrity"" from the 80's but we won't call her/him out. ;)

"This is a historic hotel with old charm and modern updates. We didn't spend too much time in the hotel but when we did we were impressed with the size and amenities it had to offer. It has a coffee shop, small shopping, bar, and a great exercise area. It is close to the L Red stop that allows you to be able to take the train from the airport (O'Hare for us). The room was larger than expected and extremely clean. The only downside was that the coffee machine had not been replenished from the previous travelers. As mentioned, it is close to an L Red Stop that will allow you quick access to the loop or anywhere the L goes. We had purchased a three day pass on the L which made our travel easy and cheap during the trip. Grant Park is across the street and is great for wondering and enjoying the day outside. You can get to the lakefront trail for a run or walk along the lake."
"I took my daugther and her friend to Chicago over Easter break and we stayed at the Hilton across from Grant Park. One of the reasons I chose this hotel was the room set up: two double beds and two bathrooms. The girls shared the larger bathroom and I had the other all to myself! The hotel itself is very posh, and service was also very good. It is an easy walk to Shedd, the Field Museum, or Adler,(about a mile) as well as a short taxi ride (about $10) to Navy Pier or Magnificient Mile shopping. We didn't eat at any of the hotel's restaurants, but room service was quick and good, not too expensive. The lobby coffee shop also had a lot of grab and go choices. The pool isn't large, but it was nice to soak in the hot tub after a day of walking around the city and museums. Parking at the hotel was convenient, and we had a special package that included parking, which generally runs about $50/day at many downtown hotels, so that was another factor is choosing the Hilton. We had a great visit and felt like VIPs the entire time.

"The Chicago Hilton is quite a grand, old hotel with lots of history. The architecture is from the 20's and beautiful, but this hotel has so much more to offer.The lobby area and rooms could use some updating - carpet, decor, curtains, and bedding was plain and old looking and gave the appearance of looking dirty. We were registered as 4 guests sharing a room but we could not get the hotel to give us 4 towels - ever - even after repeated calls! Beds were not very comfortable. The location of the hotel is in a great place and near public transportation. Lots of stores and tourist attractions are close by. The hotel has a convenient 'Herb & Kitchen' grab and go for food, but take your wallet, because prices are outrageously expensive, or better yet check out Trader Joe's down the street.Overall, I'd rate the hotel as average based this experience."
"Really good location, really helpful when you want to visit all the museums, aquarium, the city. go shopping and when you finish you can relax in the hotel and enjoy your stay. I visited Chicago for 3 days and been HHonors Member was great, having some extras in the stay. one other thing HHonors has this option to upgrade your room, you can pay an small amount or only use your points, that is really good when you dont want to spend to much and have the great options."
"The once grand hotel welcomed heads of states and the Queen of England. And you know why when you stay there. First ya just gotta love a hotel room with two full bathrooms! This was my second year staying here and it's not only beautiful the staff is great. Our only problem this year was the housekeeper kept forgetting to leave towels and coffee. Every day except for our last day, we were there for a week, we had to call and request towels and coffee. It's lovely"
"I was here recently on business and loved my stay. I was upgraded to a beautiful corner room on the 22nd floor. The hotel is one of the older ones in the city, but has been renovated recently and you couldn't tell how old it really was. It has charm and the location is right across from Millenium park. Loved my stay!

I was here for a week for a convention. I absolutely loved the hotel and the area. The hotel was very historic and very well kept. Enjoyed the room the bed was very comfy. The bathroom and the room could use some updating. Wallpaper was coming off the wall and chargers kept falling out of the wall. My view out the window was of a roof and another room. Staff was very helpful and friendly at this hotel.
"I was in town for a large conference, housed within the hotel. I have to say, for a large conference hotel, it was an excellent stay. The staff was by far some of the friendliest and most helpful that I've had in a hotel, even as they were sold out and insanely busy. The hotel itself is a historic treasure and beautiful. The lobby alone is worth wandering around in for a while. On the room front, we had an upgraded Executive Floor room, which was lovely. Not super huge, but had a good view of the city and was new.The location is pretty great too. You're agross the street from the park and a couple of blocks from the L, so there is plenty to do right outside the door as well as easy access around the city."
"Booked executive floor which includes lounge access and internet. Internet in my room did not work, was told that because its an old building. Staff did move me but I had to ask for assitance with the move and there was no apology. Shouldnt sell a product you cant provide because old building. Dirty room service trays on floor of hallway for @18 hours.Elevators broken?? Wouldnt come to the floor, light just kept turning off. More than once waited 5+ minutes until someone came to the floor. Had to request the room be cleaned on two of four days of stay. On one day i waited until 5pm before i finally asked. Checked in early and was told they would call me when room ready, @12 noon. Got a call at 430pm. Forget i was told room would be ready at 12 noon, check in is 3pm. Then then the real kicker. Went to a dinner tonight. I do not eat red meat. Entree was fish and beef. Asked for no meat. They took a prepared plate, picked off the beef and put down a piece of fish. there was still gravy and the onions from the meet clearly on the plate. When i said something to the waitress she didnt apologize. Instead she said, i didnt touch the food. Building and room are nice. Steve in the 720 bar was A+."
"This historic hotel, located on the infamous Michigan Avenue, is a wonderful mashup of old-world charm with modern influences. The hotel boasts beautiful ornate artwork while also having more modern areas such as the cafe/store (which serves Starbucks), and the three restaurants located on the Lobby level. BE FOREWARNED: the hotel does NOT have air conditioning. During my stay, Chicago...

"We picked this hotel because of a great deal that we found on hotels.com, and we didn't go wrong. This hotel is within 5 blocks of Shedd Aquarium. Unfortunately, it was too cold for us to walk so we ended up taking a taxi but in better weather, it would have been a perfect location. We had a lakeview room on the 11th floor. The view was amazing and our room had two bathrooms in it which was perfect for our family. The customer service is great as well. Our blow dryer did not work and we called down for a new one and within 10 minutes, we were provided with a brand new one. The computer was set up to turn on every morning at 8:00, which was sortof creepy but it was convenient in helping you navigate around the hotel. Taxi's were reasonable as well. We were out $10 to go from this hotel to the American Girl store. From there, we were able to walk to the Observatory and then down to Gino's East on Superior and catch a taxi back. There is a great starbucks downstairs along with some homemade ice cream and all sorts of food items. We did not partake in the restaurants but the stuff at the snack bar was good. The pool on the 8th floor was really nice! It is a lap pool and there were also two hot tubs - one for adults only and one that the kids could play in. The gym looked really nice too but we did not use it. The bedding and rooms were very clean and the beds were comfortable. If you get a chance to see the grand ballroom, I suggest it. This room is breathtaking!"
"I'm here alone for a conference. The room is fine. Not an option for my family of 4 because the two bed rooms are double beds, which are too tiny for an adult and large child. There's room for larger beds in most hotel rooms yet it is always hard to find such places. Why?The place is huge. Took a day to figure out the conference rooms. The rooms are not ideal for sound because rooms pickup sound from other rooms. I'm on a workout kick and headed to the gym. Learned they wanted $15 to use the equipment. Really?! It's a nice gym but I'm used to places where there is no fee to work out. It's not like someone is giving you a massage. The front desk gave it to me complimentary when I whined about it. There are quick notes to eat a short walk from hotel. It's ridiculously cold out, however so many may not want to walk. I'd choose this hotel if rooms were better for families if I wanted to go to the nearby museums, but the double beds are a huge minus. There is room for one or two air beds, so that's an option if you wanted to bother bringing such items or if hotel could guarantee roll always. In short, the location, the elegant space, and the nice accommodations make this a great choice for 1 or 2 people."
"It really is disturbing that WiFi is not included. Internet its not a luxury or an extra, it is as important as having a bathroom in the room!Very nice hotel otherwise, nice service, beautiful room and great location. We were encouraged to use the rooms internal computer to order room service except that didn't work so we used the old fashioned way and called on the handset. Perhaps they are struggling with technology?

My stay at the Hilton Chicago was excellent. Everyone was very accommodating and friendly from the minute we stepped into the hotel. The bell hop was funny and very nice. The hallways had a very faint good smell. I can't put my finger on what the smell was but it was delightful. We stayed on the 9th floor which has been remodeled and it was beautiful. We had a room facing the lake and we watched as a line of snow came across the lake. Sunrise was beautiful. There was a refrigerator in the room even though their website doesn't say anything about one being in the room. That was a plus. I don't usually like the smell of the bathroom toiletries but I did like the smell of the toiletries in the hotel! I recommend staying here. Had a great time.
"If you would LOVE to stay at one of the most beautiful Hotels in the city, the Hilton and Towers is it. I do believe it is called the Hilton Chicago now.It dates back to before Al Capone and is Just as beautiful now as the pictures and books i have seen and read of the place. The service was cery good and the food and bars are excellent. They have everything you need from internet to big Flat screen TV`s, Very reasonable rooms (some that even have two bathrooms) that come in very handy. It`s right across the street from gorgeous Grant Park and just a Very quick walk from the Field Museum, Shedd Aquarium and Planetarium along with Soldier field and 2 BIG Marinas on the lake.The People who work there from parking cars to Taking your reservations to management are extremely helpful and friendly! My wife and i have stayed there 9 times for nightly or 2 night ""Getaways"" and have never come away with any impression but WOW!

"Front desk gave us incorrect room information so we went up to the room we were given (19th floor) and found that the keys didn't work. Mistakes happen, but this kind of thing is a major drag after traveling. Front desk should have a bit more attention to detail. Room was spacious and comfortable. Furnishings need to be updated, but were otherwise comfortable. Was strange to have two bathrooms in the double room. Hotel staff should play up the hotel's storied past more, it's quite fascinating.


Room Tip: I suspect double rooms may have larger floor plan than the king rooms.

Stayed here with family when running the Chicago marathon. Was very happy with our room and the breakfast buffet was outstanding; this was particularly the case on the morning of the race when they opened the restaurant an hour early to ensure the runners could fuel-up in advance of the race. The hotel is perfectly situated (parallel to North Michigan avenue) and is a great base from which to explore the city. For anyone doing the marathon it's also the ideal location and is only a ten minute walk to the start and finish line; very important when you've just ran 26 miles!
"Nice hotel with helpful staff -- WITH THE EXCEPTION OF SECURITY. I would NEVER accept an adjoining room form this hotel if you value your sleep. I was there on business and the room next to me had over 35 people in it partying ALL NIGHT LONG. I called Security twice -- at 11:30 PM and at 3:30 AM and the response I received the next morning was that the room was not registered to anyone. Did Security do ANYTHING to investigate? Perhaps the ""DO NOT DISTURB"" sign on a non-rented room should have been a clue???"
"we stayed here using their chill package. I would highly recommend this package, it included free coffee, two coffee travel mugs, in and out self park, Internet access, 20% off food at their property resturants and bar. The lobby was amazing a throw back to the past. Staff was friendly, helpful and pleasant. I also liked after 10p you needed your room key to get past security set up by the elevators.Hotel had a nice location near Millineun park, the L line and Grant park.The small bistro in the main lobby was nice, good coffee and for a hotel reasonably priced sandwiches, pizza slices etc.The actual rooms and hallways above the lobby are dated but clean and comfortable, and have all necessary amenities. With parking and Internet included I don't think you could find a better value than this hotel. We will stay here again

"I stayed at the Hilton Chicago this past January for the PCMA Convening Leader's conference. The Hilton was one of the host hotels and from the minute I checked in I was happy I chose to stay here. The front desk staff were efficient and accommodating to my requests. Although my room had not been renovated and was showing it's age a little, it was still clean and extremely comfortable. The housekeeper who was assigned to my room for the 3 days I was there was lovely to deal with and so friendly. The hotel has a few dining options. The Irish Pub I believe is independant of the hotel. The food and bevvies were pretty good. They have a small ""everything"" kind of food spot right off the lobby where you can get Starbucks, other beverages and fresh made hot food and cold packaged foods to go along with bottled beer and wine. They also have a sitdown restaurant and a BEAUTIFUL lounge at the other end of the hotel. There is also a great fitness facility with pool at the hotel....although there is a charge to use the equipment if you're not a Hilton Gold member (the pool and walking track are free to use). The hotel is ideally located for walking around to lots of little shops and ""THE BEAN"" at Millenium Park is maybe 5 blocks away. I can't wait to go back and stay again.

"I stayed here for a conference and could not have been happier. The hotel is in a fantastic location. There are lots of places to eat, the bean, and the art museum are all with in walking distance. The hotel is clean, spacious, and has great staff. The Herb Kitchen downstairs has great food. There was even renovations going on while we stayed at the hotel but it did not disturb us at all! I would highly recommend staying here."
"I just wanted to take the time out to give thanks to BURGESS HATFIELD, I'm here with the BEM conference meeting i was at dinner and went to get a beverage which happened to only be soda i don't drink soda, so there were two gentlemen whom worked for the hotel and i asked was it possible that i could have juice instead of soda the one gentlemen immediately said no but Burgess jumped right in and said yes and asked what kind f juice i wanted and went immediately without hesitation to get my beverage. When he returned he gave me both cranberry as well as grape juice. I immediately thanked Burgess for it and told him i really appreciate what he did. He told me that the gentleman that was standing next to him happened to be his captain. As a captain thats NOT AT ALL SHOWING LEADERSHIP As a manager myself i would have never told the guest/customer no, what Burgess did was showing great LEADERSHIP for satisfying the customer/guest. I do hope that he will be acknowledged for this because even though it was something as small or simple as juice it made a difference and as a suggestion for these kinds of events maybe adding juice as an option would be better for guest. But again i want to thank Burgess Hatfield for his excellent guest service and ""satisfying the guest."" Thank you,Dante Shawshawdante@ymail.com"
"We usually stay much further north on Michigan Ave., but the price of the Chill-cation package - with parking included - was a steal. Our room on 15th floor was nice and clean, but decor was in need of an upgrade. Other floors appeared to be more recently updated. Great view of the lake, close to Harrison stop on the red line, easy to get everywhere we wanted to go.


Green Features: I appreciated that they gave us a bag for recyclables and were clear about what could be recycled."
"We have been staying at the Hilton for the past 16 years during the week between Christmas and New Years. We have seen many changes over the years , they are always improving or rehabbing rooms there. This year we stayed on the 10th floor . The floor and all rooms were recently rehabbed. We had a two bedroom, Michigan Ave. Suite like always. The bedrooms were sharp, comfortable, still having two bathrooms on the double and one in the King. The Parlor also has a full bathroom. The Parlor was furnished with two living areas, both having a large Flat screen. They finally put a large oval table in the middle that seats 6. My only disappointment was that they removed the 7' Marble bar that I always loved standing behind in the second living space. My suggestion would be to put the Mini Fridge in that section of the new Bar area and not in the other living area. It makes no sense to have to walk across the parlor to use the Fridge. Again , we had a great time and the Staff is one of the best around ! This Historic Hotel is keeping up with the Times and stays a Classic all at once.

overall nice hotel but few things need to be fixed. the soap dishes in the shower were corroding with green corrosion obvious sign that attention to details is not there. the shower drain needs to be fixed showered for about 15 minutes standing in 6 to 8 inches of water I seriously doubt that it had just become a problem with me. Lastly the counter that had the tv on it had only been half wiped off and was also obvious had not been cleaned properly for some time was able to write kilroy was here in the dust. So with that not sure if I would stay there again.
"We stayed at the Hilton for 4 nights prior to Christmas, and found it in need of updating. We stayed in a room on the 15th floor. I don't know about other areas of the hotel, but our room needed to enter the 21st century. The room was clean, but old and outdated. The staff were not really helpful when we checked in or when the hotel changed our room code and we were locked out. The front desk seemed to be understaffed, and we never could get anyone to come to the Hilton Honors section of the desk to help us (we are Honors members). Overall, it's a massive hotel in a convenient location with so-so staff and tired room decor. I hate the policies of supposedly top-tier hotels like this one that don't supply free wifi in rooms or access to the hotel gym. Our next stop on our trip was a Hampton Inn in suburban St. Louis, which was modern and staffed by the most caring, friendly people. What a contrast!"
"Admittedly we were there over the New Year's Eve period but waiting 10-15 minutes for an elevator every time you went downstairs, fighting crowds to get into the elevators or to the Cafe and rooms and corridors that look like they were last renovated when JFK was in office isn't hat I expected from a Hilton. Calling it a landmark and a classic isn't an excuse for letting it get old and packing join too many people for the old-age facilities. Staff were efficient but grumpy - apart from the serving staff in the Restaurant 720 South who were very good most of the other staff were grumpy and begrudging - felt like I was doing something wrong to ask simple assistance - so after a while I just stopped. I'm sure that there are a lot of better places in Chicago so I won't be going back - and I am a Diamond HHonours Guest!

"We took our girls to stay here for the weekend during the 1D Concert at Soldier Field. The lobby and parking drop off was an absolute zoo - thankful I was hilton honors as the line for normal check in was three times as long as ours. Other than that aspect, the rooms are clean, spacious and quiet for this old brick gem. It has been updated- but you pay for it. Parking, water, wi-fi, breakfast are high - downtown prices. But you can walk to soldier field, the Bean, coffee shops and a few other ""chains"" right around the corner to mitigate expenses. We overlooked the pale facing the lake and could see Navy Pier; the down side is the traffic noise and the 6 am Sunday morning race in the park - you could hear every announcement and the music was loud. But that is summer in Chicago- this is an iconic hotel fit for any traveler - family, business, or weekend getaway. Millers pub was packed both nights after the concert and I will say they did NOT plan accordingly for the post concert rush at the market / Starbucks. Starving teenage girls at 11 pm don't want to hear you are out of anything! Be wary going out the back of the hotel - stay in groups - but it is beautiful and the service was spot on."
"Have stayed at this hotel many times, last was the worst. We had a king suite with 2 baths, which is great, View of the lake, was awesome. Also had a bar and another king Murphy bed-when was the last time you saw a Murphy bed? It was in the living area, I could have put it up, but we put our bags on it. Great location to the Art Museum, Grant park is across the street. Now the bad- lounge which had snacks, sodas, and breakfast was closed, opening???? They did not know. No robes, slippers in room-this was a king premium suite. My bad I did not bring these, I had assumed, as prior visits, they would be there. We liked the pool area/hot tubs; but one day they had a red-neck luncheon with loud 15 adults and 20+ kids in and out of the hot spas, which by the way are not allowed, I guess they have trailer park rates-I wonder who they left behind to watch the double wides. I complained and got 2 breakfast coupons, good for the Sunday brunch-which was no different than the daily spread. Waiters were good- they do have a fantastic eggs benedict-you have to ask for it, different and delicious. We wanted a getaway weekend, disappointed. Stay at the Palmer house, great hotel, great bar.Went on Michigan Ave to look at the Christmas displays, called ""white devils"" by black panthers chanting on sidewalk, welcome to Obama's America.We will stay in New York. Also tons of preteens at the hotel at some youth conference, running and screaming in the hotel constantly.

"The staff was very friendly and helpful at our recent stay at the Hilton. We were looking for just a quick overnight stay that would lend itself to touring downtown Chicago and letting the kids hang in the pool in the evening and the morning. The Hilton delivered. Location was great, the front desk staff was very nice and bonus that our standard double room had TWO bathrooms! Makes life a lot easier when you are a mom of two girls...the rooms have been recently renovated, so they are modern and clean. Probably the only downside is that movie rental is pricey. But I suppose that comes with downtown hotel territory. We are planning our return trip next Christmas break. Such a fun thing for parents and kids to do together!"
The Hilton New Years Eve party is a joke and I will not attend again. It was misrepresented on the website about what you get for the ticket price. DO not waste your money. $150 per ticket. No balloon drop. No toast at midnight. Bartenders were slow and service stopped at 1:00am. It took on average a half hour to get a drink. No place to sit down. Website said multiple ballrooms and there was only one available. Website also spoke of casino games but they were no where to be found. Avoid this party at all cost. Save your money.
"I really recommend this hotel for people visiting Chicago. I always stay there. It gets better and better, It's conveniently located with great views of the lake and on the park and near to shopping. The gym, pool and spa are all well maintained and not overcrowded given a hotel this size. I stayed over the New Year's holiday. The hotel was full and catered to a wedding as well as the usual new year's crowd. Service and security were excellent. All staff were friendly, as usual and anxious to please. Breakfast and dinner were well prepared and served. And for me a mark of excellence is clean bathrooms. I will continue to stay here on my trips to Chicago.

"We stayed here to ring in the New Year at the hotel. We checked in on Tuesday December 30 and was planning to stay until January 3, 2015. On Wednesday night there was a NYE party at the hotel which required party goers to wear arm bands. My wife and I had dinner reservations in the hotel at 720 Restaurant. When we finished dinner, we were heading to the elevators and noticed security checking arm bands of people before allowing them to the elevator. We were able to get by with the purple arm bands we were wearing. Later in the night around 1am, we were heading up to our room but was not allowed to because we did not have a yellow arm band. We proceeded to the front desk to find out why we were not told about this at check-in on Tuesday. The worker told us that they did not get the yellow arm bands until Wednesday and the checking for yellow arm bands went into affect at 6:00 pm. He also informed us that a message was left on our phone informing us of this. Remember, we were able to get up to our room wearing purple arm bands at 6:45pm. Once we got up to our room, we did not find a message on our phone informing us of the need for yellow arm bands. Two lies within 2 minutes of each other. As a Hilton Honors member who travels quite a bit, I was very turned off by this and very upset. The next day I went to speak to someone at the front desk to find out if it was normal practice to lie to guest and I was informed it was not. This person said that they would give me all four nights of my stay for $99.00 per night. When I received my bill the morning of check out, that was not the case. Lie number 3. Checking with the front desk to find out why the correction was not made, it appeared that I was an inconvenience to her. She left or 10 minutes to discuss with the manager about what could be done. In the end I got the price as stated above. I also used the concierge desk on several occasions and found the same person to be very rude both times. All you could get form her was, ""how can I help you"". Nothing along the lines of good morning how are you, nothing. Again it gave the appearance of an inconvenience for her having to assist someone. The people that run the Herb and Kitchen give the appearance that they are clueless at their jobs. It should not take 25 minutes to get 2 coffees and a Danish, but it did. We did receive great service at the bar and from the bell hops. Other than those two bright spots, this was by far the worse stay I have ever had at a Hilton property. Nest time I am in Chicago, I will not be staying there."
"I just returned from our annual meeting in Chicago. Since the meeting was at McCormick Place, I chose a hotel closer to the Center but with a good reputation. I arrived very early, so I couldn't check in to my room. My phone number was taken so that I could be called when the room was ready. No surprise, I never got a phone call. When I checked in that evening, I was ""upgraded"" to a City View room. I can't imagine what my non-upgraded room was! I had a view of other rooms and the building across the street. Oh well, I guess not having status with Hilton makes a difference and I don't have status! Anyway, the room was a spacious king. However, the toilet seat wouldn't stay up and the tub drained very slowly. I was only here for 3 nights, so I managed. Yes, I could have called, but you'd think that housekeeping would notice. Anyway, the hotel itself was beautiful, and even though it was marathon weekend, I never waited long for an elevator. The bed was comfortable, the room clean and the location of the hotel was what I needed. Next time, though, a hotel on the Mag Mile north of the river would be better. There was always a need to take a cab to restaurants, etc. Overall, I was satisfied, but I think that only being a Blue level member hurts you at the Chicago Hilton. If the price is right, staying here is fine. It is a full service hotel, with restaurants, hair services, shops, and even a shoe shine. Would I stay here again? If I had to. There are just so many other choices in this city that are more convenient."
"We took the Amtrak train to visit Chicago with our two sons, ages 8 and 10. I chose the Hilton Chicago because it was at the midway point between the Amtrak station and the attractions that we wanted to see. We arrived at Union Station a little after lunchtime on a Friday and carried our bags to the hotel. It was just over a mile and was easy to find. After depositing our suitcases, we hiked back the way we came to visit the Willis tower that afternoon. We had walked right by it on our way to the hotel but didn't want to try to take our luggage up the tower. We spent the next 3 days visiting Field Museum, the Museum of Science and Industry, and the Shedd Aquarium. The Field and Shedd are roughly one mile from the hotel and easy to walk to. There is a Metra Electric train station a block from the hotel which will take you to the Museum of Science and Industry. It was $3 each way and took 20 min (on weekends kids ride free too - Bonus!)The hotel location was perfect for our trip. I was also pleased with our room. When we checked in, they said we were in the recently renovated portion of the hotel. It had nice decor and enough room for the 4 of us to move around comfortably. The breakfast is horribly overpriced (as per usual at these level of hotels) but there are starbucks and other places to pick up food nearby. There is also Starbucks in the small cafe in the hotel itself. For dinner, there are many restaurants nearby within walking distance. We were tired and cold one night (we visited in December) after returning to the hotel so we opted to eat at the Irish grill there. It was uninspiring food, but decent and filling. And they had a decent beer selection. If you need to pick up a snack or something for breakfast in your room, there is a 7-11 store 2 blocks from the hotel. So I was very happy with how this hotel worked out for our stay and would recommend it."
Myself and my son stayed in this hotel during visit to Chicago .It is a great hotel with spacious rooms .The outlook is traditional .I gather that this hotel is an old one right from world war 2 times .The ball room gives a majestic look .The places to visit in Chicago are located near to the hotel with the subway station at a walkable distance from hotel .Hence we could move around places through subway train.
"We were celebrating the end of my cancer treatments and we couldn't have chosen a better place. The suite was very nice, the bed super comfy and the room very clean. The holiday decorations were beautiful and I loved the hotel trivia in the elevator. Learned some very cool things about the property while riding up and down. The pool area was very nice and we enjoyed the hot tub. Kitty O'Shea's was OK, not the best, but not bad. The doormen were very helpful and the location was convenient to the museums and shopping. There is not one bad thing to report on this historic property. We stayed in room 1163 and could see the lake from our room. Thank you, Hilton, for always providing as great stay!


Green Features: The Hilton offered recycling bags in the room, which I thought was wonderful!"
"This hotel was perfect for 11 of us coming from 5 different cities on Christmas Day and staying for 2 nights. The staff, while working on Christmas Day, was nothing short of wonderful. From Bradford the VERY patient bellman to Alicia the top notch HHonors front desk person and everyone else, we had a great experience. If you treat people nicely, it comes back to you and that always goes both ways. We were given room upgrades and always had employees inquiring as to our well-being - from the front desk staff to the athletic club to housekeeping, the fantastic doorman, bartenders and wait staff. The location was perfect for hanging out, the Bean, ice skating, shopping and bars. Thanks Hilton - we won't hesitate to recommend you to others and will be back!

"We book the stay and park package, which was a good value for the area. The hotel has been redecorated since the last time I had stayed there and it looks great! We also enjoyed the hotel's close proximity to museums and live music venues. We ordered room service for breakfast. The server was punctual and friendly, and the food was very good.I did not give the hotel the highest rating because of issues we had with the computerized service system and a minor housekeeping issue. The hotel was notified of both issues and addressed them during our stay."
"This is a stunning, classic property. We stayed at the end of a wonderful Thanksgiving week to be closer to the airport. The holiday decorations were beautiful although I didnt see a Hanukkah menorah anywhere. Overall it was a great stay. The staff was incredible with extra kudos to Alison at the Bell Desk and Aleisha at the HHoners front desk. The location was perfect, right accross from Grant Park and just minutes from everywhere. Our only problem was the room. While it was newly renovated it was very tiny and looks nothing like the pictures on the hotel site. The room was so small that I bumped my head on the wall when seated on the bed to remove my shoes. There waas a useless bench at the foot of the bed that took up most of the space between the bed and desk that I stubbed my toes each time I walked by. Also the thermostat in the room was disfunctional. Lastly, our most desirable amenity was missing from the room, no in room coffe pot as was clearly listed under hotel amenities. Better ask for an upgrade if you are travelling with more than one person. On a better note, dont miss Kitty O'Shea's in the lobby. Great food, great drink and great service.

"So disappointed when we were told that we won't be able to get the Junior Suite we booked over two months ago because they were overbooked. We got downgraded to 2 double beds standard. When we walked in to our room, we saw lots of crumbs all over the floor, filthy counters and the carpeting was old and ripped. We travelled so many times in a year for how many years now and we never experienced anything like it. Yes we got an apology from the front desk who checked us in about the downgrade but that was it for all the inconvenience. We would have thought for a Hilton Hotel you would have gotten anything better than this."
"We are a family of four and stayed here for one night after visiting the Field Museum all afternoon. The hotel is within walking distance from the Museum. The lobby was beautifully decorated for Christmas. Even though they were very busy, the check-in was friendly and went smoothly. Our two connecting rooms were on the 14th floor facing the lake. They had recently been renovated and were nicely done. The rooms were large especially the one with two double beds. Both rooms had a small refrigerator and a two seat sofa as well as a desk chair. The bathrooms were modern and very clean. The heating system was very quiet and kept a constant temperture in the rooms. The windows were equipped with both a day and night shade. We had a very nice swim in the pool before checking out. We enjoyed dinner in the 720 Bar as the restaurant was closed. After bar appetizers we were allowed to order dinner from the closed resturant menu. The food was fresh and cooked just the way we ordered it. The portions were so large that we had to box some to take back to the rooms and put in the refrigerators. We enjoyed the breakfas buffet in the 720 restaurant. All the normal breakfast items and eggs cooked to order. Throughout our stay at this beautiful hotel we were met with friendly smiling employees who were willing to help in any way. We will be staying here again soon.

"We stayed here on a Sunday to watch a football game and despite the hectic atmosphere, the employees both outside and inside were absolutely welcoming and accommodating to our group. This hotel is BEAUTIFUL. The decor and the gigantic Christmas tree were so delightful - especially this time of year! Made for such an easy stay! Check-in was quick, the amenities were great and the room was in line with the rest of the hotel. The room had what we needed. Beds were comfy. We were surrounded by amazing restaurants and only a $10 cab ride takes you to a street lined with stores for a good shopping trip. Would stay here again!"
"This hotel is very welcoming, service-oriented, and elegant. All of the folks who work in the lobby, the front desk, and the outdoor areas do their best to make you feel at home and help you plan your daily adventures. They are knowledgable about the city and can help you find anything you'd like to do. There are great amenities as well as services like the bag check for when you arrive early or leave late. Everyone is kind and helpful. You will love staying in the Hilton!"
"Had a wonderful trip to Chicago for some business, but was able to bring my family along for some quality time when possible. Chicago is a wonderful town and so many things to do/see near the hotel. Great location, food was wonderful at the hotel as well. Only issue we had was noise from the hallways leaking into our room. Understandable that you can't control every aspect of those that roam the hallways, but it did create sleeping problems for our family."
"Our stay at the Hilton Chicago was amazing! The room was beautiful and the view was great. The historic components of the hotel were truly stunning and the service was wonderful, we truly felt like VIPs even though it was just my husband, two kids, and me staying for a little family fun overnight. The breakfast was delicious and we couldn't believe all the perks we got for one low price. There was a formal event going on in the hotel that night, and so during the night we heard some drunken shenanigans going on in the hallway, but that is not the hotel's fault. We will DEFINITELY be coming back!! Probably the best hotel experience we've ever had. We felt so fancy and well-treated and the kids loved the lights in the pool too."
"The Hilton on Michigan Ave. in Chicago is one of my favorite hotels...steeped in tradition, and we generally love opportunities to stay there. Unfortunately, our most recent trip was tarnished by an inept and somewhat curt front desk employee who essentially disregarded our early check in request and left my spouse (a cancer patient) lingering in the lobby for 5 hours after promising a wait of no more than an hour....and she had to go back to him...he never came to find her. The refreshments I had ordered for her to have during the afternoon while I was out on business did not arrive until evening. This employee was completely aloof about taking any ownership of this unpleasantness or offering any solutions and I had to resort to locating the front desk manager the next morning. Fortunately, that person fully understood Hilton's exceptional quest service policies and went above and beyond to accomodate us and make amends."
"We stay here all the time. The hotel was decorated beautifully for Christmas and was quite enjoyable in that respect. Our room was on the 8th floor opposing Michigan Avenue. We heard the rumbling of trains all three days we were there. Their frequency was about every 2-3 minutes. We were also near the Lake Rooms which was opposite a service hallway. We overcame the noise, but will request not to stay in that area of the hotel again."
My husband and I stayed here one night while we were in town to see the Chicago Symphony Christmas show. The hotel is in a GREAT location! The hotel itself is old and classy but it has some problems. Our room was located on the 16th floor and when you walk into the room the bed is RIGHT next to the door. We went to bed at 11 PM and were woken up numerous times during the night by people being loud in the hallway. There was also sticky stuff on the night stand and the lamp was broken. It seemed a little over priced for such an old hotel. But I guess you pay for the location!
"This was not my first stay at the Chicago Hilton, but my third. It was however my first stay in about 10 years. They have made some serious renovations to modernize this classic beauty. This iconic hotel on South Michigan Ave has some serious history to it and they let you know about it every turn. Heck, even in the elevators there's a scrolling ""did you know"" type of quiz constantly running.I was fortunate enough to get a room on one of the renovated floors, which was fantastic! It was like staying at any modern Hilton with all the ammenities: wifi, excellent lighting, modern furniture, HDTV, modern bathroom and tile. Loved it!Parking is absurd, but you won't get away from that in any hotel in Chicago... real estate is rare so parking is expensive. My only other gripe is that a lot of the rooms will have a view of a wall. The hotel has several ""inlets"" where the windows face another room or a brick wall. It's really hard to avoid unless you've got status or pay out extra money for a lake view.

"I stayed for one night at the Hilton Chicago, in November. When I reserved the room, parking was included in my rate. When I arrived at the hotel the valet guys told me to go ahead an park and keep the ticket and they would validate at the front desk. I arrived before 3:00p.m. and was able to check in right away. I got to my room and was really surprised at how spacious it was. I've stayed at other hotels in Chicago and the rooms are much smaller. It was nice to have the extra space. My room faced the skyline of Chicago so I couldn't complain about the view. I was in Chicago to do some shopping and visit some friends, so I didn't take advantage of the amenities the hotel has to offer, but it all looked great. The location is great. A bit South of all the shopping on Michigan Ave, but the walk is well worth it. It is across from Grant Park, near Millenium Park and the Field Museum. I would definitely stay here again when visiting Chicago."
"Very fine hotel and staff! I always stay here! I have noticed they are cutting back on maintenance and some of the wonderful attractions, like the gingerbread house by the elevators etc. I hate to see these little things go away! It's part of the Chicago Hilton tradition to which many of us have become accustomed at Christmas! Kittie(sp?) O'Shea's is open only on a limited basis. It was closed on Tuesday before the Midwest Clinic this year. Kittie's has ALWAYS BEEN the gathering place for Directors from around the world on Tuesday before Midwest. Shame! Seems like someone should notice these things before booking a private party in to Kittie O'Shea's before Midwest........."
"I had the opportunity to stay at the Hilton over the weekend, and as has been the case for years, the stay was wonderful. The location across from Grant Park, near Millenium Park and Museum Campus, is the best in the Loop.The check-in was easy as you can now choose your room online prior to arriving. The Athletic Club pool and sauna were a great way to start and/or end the day and the rooms were well appointed. The Executive Level is under renovation and the Concierge Desk and Executive Lounge are closed. Floors 25 and 22 are open. They are giving certificates for breakfast, (be sure you get the one for the weekend 720 Breakfast Buffet) and evening appetizers at Kitty O'Shea's. I was told the first stage will be completed in February and then they'll swap to the other floors.The grand Christmas Tree was up, but sadly no Gingerbread House this year. We had a great swtay and will return to see how the new renovations turned out.

"Stayed for one night on the 20th of December. Check in was fine except for the staff member trying to convince me that I didn't want the room with the king sized bed I'd paid for and that she was doing me a favour by offering me a room with two doubles or a 'Murphy bed'. After much faff I was finally given the room I'd originally asked for. Call me old fashioned but I don't equate two doubles or a drop down occasional bed to a standard king size. The hotel was obviously pretty busy due to the debutants ball but still no reason to shaft paying customers. The room itself was decent and reflected the price paid. It had apparently been refurbished but after a night of interrupted sleep it was pretty clear that the recent works did not extend to upgrading the non existent sound proofing. From kids mouthing off in the halls to the sounds of drunken revellers/sirens etc outside, it was pretty tough to sleep. On the plus side the bar downstairs is pretty decent and the location is a plus. I certainly wouldn't chose to stay again unless the deal was irresistible. Definitely stayed in worse, certainly stayed in better."
"Service - Nothing special, they are all accommodating, you'll get in almost all Hilton Hotels.Room - My room was small since it was under corporate rate, but I had a wonderful view of Sears/Willis Tower and it was clean.Food - As long they serve good bacon and omelet for breakfast I'm happy.., which they did.Location - Very near Millennium Park, Museums, Restaurants, Bars, 7/11, and Malls.Price - I cannot comment much since it was a company paid trip.


Room Tip: Ask for a room away where the side of the train is.

"The Hilton Chicago is a historic property, and it's huge. It's a hotel that handles a lot of convention business and group activities. Being historic and huge don't add up to a good experience in this case. The rooms are hit or miss with respect to whether you get one that's renovated or not. Non-renovated rooms are tired, frayed and jarring in terms of interiors and finishes. Most of the meeting spaces fall into the historic non-renovated category. The staff is for the most part pleasant, but perfunctory. The Front Desk staff is not well organized. I was part of a group of 40, and each person got different answers from the staff regarding room availability and amenities that had been arranged as part of the group rate. Example: With a 12 night stay we were required to check-out after the first 6 nights and check back into the same room for the second 6 nights. Some of my group had it taken care of without any interaction with the Front Desk, some were required to go to the Front Desk for new keys, some were never told this would have to happen and only found out when their keys stopped working on day 6. The room rate came with complimentary wifi and as a HHonors member I should be afforded an upgraded room if available. I encountered a VERY hard sell by the Front Desk at check in to purchase an upgraded Business Room (which included wifi) for another $30 a night. I was already paying $319/night. The young lady at the desk didn't seem to be interested in the fact that I was supposed to already have the things she was trying so hard to sell me. Were it not for the fact that my business meeting were in the hotel I would not be choosing to stay here."
Stayed over Thanksgiving. Location was convenient to the red line and to the Art Institute of Chicago.Bathroom was disappointing. The soap dish in the shower was discolored which bled into the soap left in the tray.The people in the next room were noisy - indicating thin walls.The fitness center was nice.Was not happy about the WiFi situation. Apparently status with the Hilton points program is needed to get free Internet.Overall the view and the location were nice.
Grand old building. 14 elevators in the main bank mean service is refreshingly fast. The room itself could benefit from an update. The marble countertop in the bathroom prevents the lid from going all the way back and hence the toilet seat cannot stay raised unless you want to hold it there. Took about 2 minutes to get hot water in the shower at around 7:30AM. Check in and out were quick and easy.
"The concierge ladies (both) we're not very helpful. I wanted to surprise my wife with some wine and strawberries in our room before we walked in. First Lady told me this was not possible due to our room not ready , which I understand. Why couldn't they arrange this when out room was read. She insisted that this was impossible. Went back and spoke to another lady and she said would ask the room service. I asked her this was a surprise and she proceed to talk really really loud over the phone about what I wanted. I told her to keep her voice down so my wife would not hear her. she would not quite down and totally ruined my surprise. very unprofessional. Very dissatisfied. Rooms are very small and yes wall super thin. Will not be staying again."
"I recently stayed at the Hilton Chicago on a business trip as I was attending a large convention that was taking place at McCormick Place Chicago. The location was very convenient to the convention center and the room was nice and quiet but nothing special. The lobby/bar area was really nice and the hotel does have a coffee shop which is always a plus. However, the breakfast in the restaurant was not great and in my opinion was significantly overpriced for what was available and the quality of the food. Overall, the Hilton Chicago is a nice hotel with a convenient location to the convention center and Solider Field. If you will be spending most of your time in other areas of the city the hotel may seem a bit out of the way.


Room Tip: Ask for a room near the elevator as each floor has many rooms and several hallways.

"The hotel is beautiful and the staff is great. I few things to know:1. The trains are noisy, ask for a room to face Michigan Avenue.2. Search for specials. We booked with a special which included parking ($52 per night), free internet ($12), 20% off food (brunch buffet was $23 per person) and mugs and coffee.3. Location is a few miles from Magnificant Mile and shopping. You will want to take a cab.4. We have Hilton Honors. We are at the lowest status (blue) but since we were signed up for honors, they gave us the 21st floor, which was nice.5. We have a 19 and 21 year old. The rooms are either 2 double or a king. Double isn't comfortable so my husband and son slept on floor.6. We had a room with 2 double beds, but it also had 2 bathrooms which was great. Saved us lots of time getting ready.Enjoy Chicago!


Room Tip: Get a room facing Michigan Ave so you don't hear trains.

"My son recommended this hotel to me. He lives in the city and knew I would like it. He was correct. I spent 2 nights in this lovely, quiet hotel. I stayed in a huge room with 2 full size beds. The room was nice, clean, and quite. I was on the 7th floor. Staff was very friendly and helpful. My parking was included in the room rate I arranged and it was very reasonable. The main lobby is beautiful with so much character. This is an old, longstanding hotel. I was asked, at check in, if I wanted to upgrade to a newly renovated room for an additional $40/night. I declined and was very happy with my room. I ran outside so, I did not go to the workout facilities in this hotel. There was a coffee maker in my room, I stayed over Thanksgiving so, did not eat any meals in the hotel. This hotel is easy to access and I will stay here in the future.


Green Features: There was a bag in my room to place all recycle able item in to be discarded."
"We had a renovated room that had 2 bathrooms, it was absolutely perfect for families. There is a small coffee shop in the lobby and several small gift stores. If you stay here you need to go in the grand ballroom, it is exquisite. The location was good. We took many cabs because you just end up walking too far to get to the main tourist attractions. As a previous reviewer states you can hear the trains at night and we also heard many sirens, but it is a big city. We had a nice view of Lake Michigan from our room and it included a computer and mini fridge. The elevator system is annoying, depending upon which floor you stay on you may have to change elevators several times. We ate breakfast in the Hilton Honors lounge, it was a very minimal breakfast and super crowded. We did like the happy hour better.


Room Tip: We loved looking out over Lake Michigan.

"I stayed over the Thanksgiving holiday and I really enjoyed this hotel. I got one of the Business Executive rooms with two beds and two baths, so it was a nice sized room and the two bathrooms was a big plus. The room had everything we needed including a refrigerator and a safe. The staff was very nice and the hotel was within walking distance to the sites I wanted to see.

"Our hotel room was very nice but to our surprise we heard the elevated train running during the night and got very little sleep. The train is one block to the west of the hotel, and our room was on the west side of the hotel. The hotel was sold out due to a convention, so we were stuck. Keep this in mind when booking a room!


Room Tip: Make sure your room is on the east side of the hotel and mention that you have heard about the train...

"Don't get me wrong, the lobby is exquisite...but the room was small, tired, had absolutely no view, and the bathroom fixtures were old and didn't work that great. Also there was no mini fridge or anything so my pricy leftovers got pitched. I just expected a lot more...even in an older room I feel like a fridge should be pretty standard. I know some rooms are renovated so this hotel is probably worth staying at if you end up in one of those. Service was excellent though. Check in was quick. $12.99 wifi per day. $60 per day parking though...typical for downtown Chicago."
"I was fortunate enough to be able to stay a week at this facility. From the moment the cab pulled up to the door until the time came to hail a cab to leave, this facility scored 5 Stars in each and every aspect! From the doorman, to the bellhop to the porter, to registration desk, to restaurants, to housekeeping to room service, to amenities offered at this location, never once were we disappointed. We were treated like we were honored guests, and have vowed if we need to return to Chicago, we would stay here. The view was amazing, day and night. You won't be disappointed in this choice. Luxury and Service at its best!


Room Tip: You can request a view of Lake Michigan / Grant Park / Navy Pier.

"Stayed one night at the Hilton Chicago before our flight out. This hotel is impressive and huge; perhaps over 1000 rooms. We stayed on the executive level 24th floor with a lakeview room. Property is across street from Grant Park and Lake Michigan. Parking is in the building, which is rare for Chicago hotels. The hotel is close to the Loop and the downtown shopping & restaurants.Staff was amazing; just friendly and helpful. Our concierge on the 24th floor seemed to be there whether day or night. The only thing they need to work on is the hors'dourve program in the evening and the breakfast. Both need to amp up. Selections were poor. For example, the breakfast has hard boiled eggs, oatmeat, and breads. Any mid-priced property provides a hot breakfast with hot eggs, bacon, sausage, breakfast potatoes, etc. Although is was good, I was expecting a standard hotel breakfast. Also, too many people in that one breakfast room. They need to work on that. Will definately stay at this Hilton again when in Chicago. Once again, the staff is well trained and amazingly friendly. Thanks Hilton Chicago.

"I recently stayed at the Hilton Chicago while attending a conference. Hotel amenities and quality: This is huge, beautiful hotel with lots of amenities on-site. On the lobby level, there are several restaurants, a coffee shop, and a bar (Kitty O'Shea's) for those who prefer not to leave the hotel. We stayed in a room with two double beds and two bathrooms; it was spacious, very clean, and comfortable. There is a computer in room that allows guests to research nearby dining and entertainment options. Location: The hotel is located in downtown Chicago, within walking distance of a lot of restaurants, shopping, and attractions. The hotel is directly across the street from the beautiful Grant Park and within 5 minutes of the lakefront, where there is trail for running or walking. The walk to the Bean takes 10-15 minutes and with a longer walk (20-25 min) or a short cab ride, you can be on Northern Michigan Ave., where there is a ton of shopping and places to eat. The location of this hotel was probably my favorite thing about it. Service: In the few interactions I had with hotel staff, they were courteous and accommodating. One of my room keys stopped working, but a security guard was up quickly to let me in and there was no problem getting replacement keys. I had to reschedule a tour I was going on and had to ask for a later check-out time to give me time to pack after the tour. The woman I spoke to was very nice and extended my check-out time by an hour at no cost.Downsides: The hotel does have an extensive fitness center with a lap pool and indoor track, but normal folks have to pay for its use. These days, I expect larger hotel chains to offer complimentary access to the fitness center, but I made use of Lakefront Trail to get my workout in instead.

"A landmark in Chicago. The biggest Hilton hotel I've stayed so far. Standard Hilton Hotel for business travellers. Very good and efficient staff. Rooms cozy, very clean and quite. Continental breakfast is simple and high quality. Very good coffee machine in the lounge ( coffee should be hot, black and strong in the morning ). Very good hotel restaurant. High quality food. Hotel needs renovation but as I heard it's already planned. Very good location for business meetings in downtown."
"I loved my recent stay at the Hilton Chicago! The place was great, the staff was amazing and the service was well done! It's in a great location and there are plenty of elevators for getting to the different floors. The food options in the hotel are great and there are a great number of restaurants located in the near blocks. The staff can offer great recommendations on site-seeing and for things to do. The are friendly and very helpful. I left a few items and they were so great about helping me get those toiletries sent to my room immediately. I was very pleased with my stay!"
"The service provided by the staff was wonderful, especially that of Darnella the perfect hostess in the executive suite on the 24th floor. She was great about providing information not only about the Hilton but Chicago, as well. The concierge on that floor was also very kind and helpful. He, like Darnella, was friendly and helpful with everyone with whom I saw them speaking. He was closing up one evening and I and a friend were still in the lounge talking while. I expressed disappointment at finding my favorite cookies gone and after casually asking what kind they were, the concierge went to the back and found some for me! It is the little details that make life enjoyable. The housekeeping staff who I encountered in the hallway coming to and from my room were always pleasant and smiling. The staff in the other businesses within the hotel, the jewelry shop and FedEx were some of the nicest people, as well. I mentioned it to one of my colleagues and they said, ""it is the Hilton way."" It had been a long time since I had stayed in a Hilton, but I will be back soon. The rooms were good and that Hilton bed is lovely. I'm thinking of purchasing the feather mattress pad for my own bed. The only things I had problems with were the lack of refrigerator in the the room and the TV stations. The TV armoire had a space in it that appeared to be where a mini fridge would go so I don't know why there wasn't one. And, the way the TV system is set up makes it more difficult than it should be to navigate through the local, cable, and hotel stations. But those are minor issues. It is a huge hotel and food is really expensive, but I have come to expect that wherever I go. The location is great as the hotel is situated on Michigan Ave across from Grant Park. If they allowed dogs I would be back sooner with my Honey girl.

"I stayed at this hotel for a conference 11/10-11/13/2014 and I was disappointed. The Hotel itself is a beautiful historic building but there were several things that affected the quality of the experience. Upon arrival I checked in and went to the bank of elevators I needed to get to my floor. I inserted my key and it did not work so the elevator would not move. I had to take my luggage back to the front desk again and they reprogrammed the key and gave me another one. I got in one elevator and it did not work again. I went into a different elevator and jiggled the card and finally the elevator moved. Be aware that if you wish to have a fridge in the room it is an extra fee. I had a lakeview room, which was nice to be able to look over Grant Park and the lake. Once settled--I had a long days travels and was looking forward to a good meal, only to find out that neither restaurant was open and my room service screen on the touch screen in my room said room service was closed so I was limited to a basic bar menu if I wanted to eat. The restaurant was all set up but closed down. People were sitting across the way at bar tables, in some cases in chairs eating at coffee tables. People would go look at the restaurant menu and you could see the diappointment on their face when they were told it was closed. Why would you have these facilities closed down when you had a couple of thousand people on site attending a conference? They were referring people elsewhere, which was astounding to me that they were turning away the business. The trade show area apparently had no elevator, and for a vendor carrying supplies in and out, it was a hassle getting big boxes up and down the stairs. There was a non functioning wheelchair elevator there but no ramp or no other way to get into the hall. The night of our reception I noticed elevators that went to the reception area. They were turned off. There were not enough tables to accomodate everyone at the reception. After a long day on their feet I would think they would anticipate people would like to sit. I headed in one evening and decided to order room service. I placed an order at 8:20 and the screen stated it would be 30-45 minutes. Time passed and when I heard nothing I called to confirm they got my order. I was told they did not get the order until 8:40 and that it would be 9:30 and it would be to my room. Okay. Didn't happen. It was 10 before I got it and even then the cobbler was cold. Disappointing. It was items like this that marred the experience. It seemed they were ill prepared and understaffed for the event. Perhaps it is a better experience when there is not an event on site but you would think if anything else they would be better prepared. Beautiful historic hotel, it is a shame it didn't deliver."
"Beautiful hotel with elegant surroundings but they seem to be having issues with their room keys. I was assigned to a room with a lock that was broken and would take an engineer to fix. I was relocated 3 floors down (this is a huge hotel so there is a lot of walking) and was fine until I went to grab my bag and checkout. My room key didn't work; neither did 6 other women's room keys that I know about (likely there were more than this). Both times I had to call the front desk and wait for security to come. The check out issue was complicated by the fact there were several of us, security was stretched thin, and they have an antiquated system of getting approval to let you into your room. Security calls the front desk and gets permission and if he doesn't get called away for an emergency (this happened) or misread the room number you wrote down (this also happened) you might get into your room within a hour. Try to make your flight late afternoon."
"While the hotel is very pretty and the rooms are clean and well appointed (although very small). I cannot believe how they nickel and dime you. I was at this Hilton in Chicago Nov. 9-12 for a travel agent conference. I am a Hilton Honors member but they don't give you the normal Hilton Honors perks at this hotel unless you are a diamond or platinum (no bottles of water in my room, no free wi-fi). I didn't even have a fridge in my room and when I questioned this, they said you have to upgrade to the business level to get a refrigerator! While at the meetings, we often could not access any wifi or even a signal on our 4G phones to text clients or reply to emails. For travel agents, this is crazy as we are always needing to contact our clients. You have to go to the first floor lobby to get free wifi! In this day and age and the price of this hotel and being a 4 star property, they should be including free wifi to EVERY meeting group that comes in, if not to everyone that comes in!"
"The front desk staff was very helpful and friendly. The room was nice and clean. It was smaller than some of the less expensive places (like Hampton Inn), but it had a nice view of Lake Michigan and Grant Park. Room service was horrible. They have interactive ordering thru the computer in the room, but it took more than an hour to get the order. When it arrived it was missing items (blue cheese for the wings, bacon on the sandwich, fruit cup). I called Room Service & no one answered after waiting for 20 minutes. So, I called the front desk to complain & they said a manager would call me back, but no one called or brought up the missing items. At check out, I complained again & the front desk gave me a discount off my stay."
"We had the pleasure of staying here in August for a conference. The hotel is exceptionally located in the Loop just off of Michigan. This means lots of easy walking locations - museums, parks, restaurants, etc. The hotel is quite large, has been well restored and has an amazing history. The rooms on the executive level have been updated and were very nice - the bathroom was a bit cramped, but they are retrofitting an old hotel. We were fortunate to have a room facing the lake - a definite plus. Our price was reasonable as it was a conference rate. We did not eat in the hotel - why would you when you can walk to any number of fantastic restaurants? - so cannot comment on the quality of their food. But drinks in the lobby were reasonably priced and the vibe was good. We would not hesitate to stay here again.


Room Tip: Paying the extra for the executive level was worth it

"This is an older hotel, but very well maintained. The rooms were large, comfortable beds, large bathrooms that are remodeled and nice toiletries. You have to pay for Wi-Fi in your room, hotel parking is very expensive (public parking is right by their parking lot and it was only $25 a night in comparison to $65 they charge). The location is close to downtown shopping which we walked and felt safe even at night. I thought the train noise would bother me, but not a problem.


Room Tip: Try to get a higher room for the noise factor outside.

"After reviewing all the negative comments about this hotel, I was a little concerned. I had stayed at the hotel before, and thought it was a fantastic place to stay, but that was at least fifteen years ago. This visit was no different that my visits before, except maybe it was better. I am happy to say it is still fantastic! First, you can't beat the location. Secondly, we were greeted warmly by a friendly staff member who checked us in quickly. The lobby is probably the most elegant we have ever seen. The marble, the crystal, the entire ambience is breathtaking. My daughter (16) was in awe. The elevators were quick, and our room (1834) was large, beautiful, clean--everything we could have wanted. I had read the comment about the room being dark until you walk around inside to find a light switch. This is actually true. It's a little weird, but it wasn't much of an issue. We had three windows with a great view and couldn't hear any of our neighbors. The bathroom was beautiful, and I believe it had been recently renovated. The beds are soft, this is true, but we had a wonderful night's sleep. I highly recommend this hotel. It's the real thing--a genuine old hotel, with lots of ambience, in one of the best areas of town.

"The Hilton Chicago is a nice hotel, but I wish I had stayed a little further north on Michigan Avenue to closer to shops and restaurants. The hotel was very nice inside and you can tell they have remodeled over the years. I did chuckle that the brass in my bathroom was well worn, but functionally it worked.Room size was decent, but the desk location was tough to pull the chair out with a bed in the way. I very much appreciated the Herb N' Kitchen for snacks and Starbucks coffee. The staff was always very friendly and helpful.Overall, it was a nice stay."
"I have previously stayed here for a conference. This was the host hotel for my business meetings and was very convenient to stay. I upgraded to the business level had a newly remodeled room that was very spacious. Excellent location on Michigan Avenue although a bit south of mag mile. I thought it was a bit expensive, but thats urban pricing when they know you are there for a conference. Weather was unbelievable mild for October. Rooms were kept very nicely cleaned and was sleep quality was good. Was told that this had a high speed internet than base rooms but not sure it really was that high speed. Classic Hotel with fantastic ballrooms. Many movies shot here! Remember the Fugitive with Harrison Ford?


Room Tip: Business level have remodeled modern rooms. Other levels more classic neoclassic styling.

"Before you book at this nice old Chicago ""gem"", be sure to check the city's event site to see if there will be a race or other event in Grant Park while you are there. We were there to run in a race that started at 6:30A, so it was expected for us. However, other guests didn't know about it & when the race organizers started talking over a PA system at 4:45A on a Sunday those guests were very unhappy. The hotel though, is a bit of a classic. Old & very big, but classy & comfortable. You will see rust on the heater in the bathroom & little things that reinforce the ""old"" part but it is clean & likeable. Easy access to Soldier Field & the museums as well as the Grant & Millenium Parks. And dog friendly!


Room Tip: Upgrade a little to a lake view room (that is, as long as there is no event in Grant Park.

"I stayed at this hotel during the PackExpo at McCormick. I have stayed here before and always leave with a sense of awe. The service is fantastic, the lobby and meeting rooms are impeccable and the location is convenient to a great many Chicago landmarks. Make no mistake, this is a historic hotel with first class written all over it. A word to the hotel management. I stayed in room 740. This is directly across the hall from the room used by housekeeping. One morning, I had the opportunity to sleep in (if you call 8:00 sleeping in). The noise in the hallway, clanging stuff, carts hitting the wall next to the head board of my bed, and laughing and joking started early. You need to address this. A word to anyone planning a meeting here. Parking is expensive. And, my personal pet peeve, they charge for their internet connection. I hate this in a hotel. When the prices are this high, it seems like they could afford to throw in a free internet connection."
"I have stayed at this hotel previously, and the Hilton Palmer House as well as I am in Chicago 2-3 times per year. My primary reason for staying at this Hilton was the fact Kitty O'Sheas was located on the premises and there was alwasy live music. Now there is no live music except on the weekends. With such a big show in town I find it hard to believe that music could not be arranged. Also, although the gym is very nice, the ""spa"" leaves much to be desired."
"The hotel is lovely and perfectly located in the heart of Chicago. So much was within walking distance that we never used our vehicle during our stay. We requested to be on a high floor, viewing the lake in a corner room and all 3 requests were honored. The room was a little small and we think that might be because we were on a corner, but it was big enough for us. The bed was the most comfortable bed ever and it was a very clean room. The hotel itself and the elevator service was all top notch and there were nice places in it to eat/drink and relax."
"I stayed four nights here, and became fairly well acquainted with the hotel services. It is a massive place -- especially well suited for businesspeople or conferences, probably less so for tourists. The entrance vestibule -- and especially the main ballroom -- are impressive, but the rest of the common areas are more modern-American-business than anything recalling glamour or prestige...

"Stayed at Hitlon for a conference last week. It is a grand old hotel, with two beautiful staircases that lead to a very busy lobby. We had good rooms with nice bedding, good air conditioning and funnily enough two bathrooms. I guess there is a considerable amount of conference room sharing that happens, in my case it made for nice square footage.The shout out is to the concierges. They were a fabulous group of well informed women, that were always happy to help us find our way around.What I loved about this hotel was its proximity to everything on the waterfront park."
"Stayed here for two nights during a business trip and I can't say enough nice things about this hotel. Located almost directly across from the Art Institute of Chicago, and directly across the park, this is the perfect location for staying in Chicago. It's a short cab ride to McCormick Place and the shops of the Magnificent Mile. However, if the weather's great, you can really walk down Michigan Avenue on the park side all the way to the shops, plus you'll get to see The Bean! The staff was very friendly. Parts of this hotel are old, like the elevators and the lobbies around the elevators, but it doesn't feel run down. Actually, it's quite the opposite; the hotel is clean and well maintained. My room was clean and comfortable, and quiet. The restaurants in the hotel are a bit overpriced, just like most hotel restaurants, but in a town like Chicago, you have plenty of other options. I will definitely be staying here in the future.


Green Features: When I got to my room, there was a paper bag on the desk that was for all my recyclables, which I thought was pretty cool."
"We chose to stay at this hotel for one night when we took a trip to Chicago to take our 4 year old son to the Shedd Aquarium and Field Museum. This hotel was within a mile of both places, so it was convenient. We were surprised at how beautiful the old style decor in this historic hotel was. We had gotten a room with 2 double beds, and I had upgraded to a lake view room when I booked. I didn't realize that I was also getting a room with 2 bathrooms! I thought that was great, even though it was just my husband, son, and I. That way I got my own bathroom, and the boys got the other! The lake view was just ok, it was like we had to look through a tunnel of two walls to see it. The room was very clean, which I greatly appreciated. I'm not sure if we were in one of the renovated rooms, but it seemed like the decor was updated. Staff was very helpful and friendly. One tip, rather than paying the high cost of parking at the hotel, we used Spothero to find parking nearby for half the price. Overall, we had a very pleasant stay, we would definitely stay here again!"
"We travel quite a bit but must admit we tend to avoid large cities during our travels. But as we had to be in Naperville for a wedding we decided to extend our vacation a few days to spend in downtown Chicago. I booked the hotel several months ago and as I looked every other week or so the price went up and by the week of our stay it had increased by $150 over what I had booked it for. I am very happy with the price I paid and have to say definitely worth the value. Would not be saying the same thing if I had booked it for price rooms were going for the week we stayed. Check in was easy and took all of 5 minutes. I will say lobby was jam packed and trying to get on an elevator with two bags was quite the challenge. We were packed like sardines, this seemed to be the only time during the entire time we were there that elevators were a challenge. Room was quite small with view looking over an alley to another building. Room did have a desk with computer that could be used to research restaurants and other local attractions that Hilton wanted you to visit. If you wanted to search for something else it would cost money, as well WI-FI was not complementary. I fail to understand why this simple amenity is not free.Bathroom was very small which made it very difficult for two people to get ready at the same time. I did find a bug crawling on the shower curtain. Wallpaper was also pealing in several areas. I was also taken back by parking to pay $52 per day seems egregious. Location of the hotel was great in terms of Grant Park and the museums but plan to do some walking if you want to hit the stores up on Michigan Avenue past the river. Walk is just over mile and half. Walk to Navy Pier probably took us about an hour. Red Line station which we took up to Wrigley Field was about 2 blocks away. As well Buddy Guy's Blues Legends is a block away we stopped in briefly one of the nights we were in town but place was packed and after walking all day we did not feel like standing. I regret this decision now. Quick stop cafe in the hotel was nice place to get quick cup of coffee in the morning although there are Starbucks on almost every block. Kitty O'Shea's convenient for a quick drink and not overly expensive. 720 South Bar and Grill was extremely expensive and I felt violated after spending $85 for 6 average drinks that would cost at most $9 any place else. Hotel Lobby was constantly packed the entire time we were there, seemed to be the meeting place for everything. I would stay in this hotel again as long as I booked early and paid a reasonable rate. Probably would also look at alternative travel arrangements. Had we not needed a car for wedding probably would have taken mass transit to and from O'Hare.

"Very old historic hotel that is definitely beautiful but.......we have been coming here, once a year, for a seminar. Nine years, nine times and always the same story, the room we reserved is not available. Every time there is an issue with our room! This time We upgraded to get a king bed instead of a double and it cost us an additional $30 per night. They claim we have a Lake view but I mainly see the side of a building. This is not a premium room."
"I stayed in this hotel for a conference which was held there. The hotel has glorious decor ranging from original detail not unlike something out of Versailles, and moving into contemporary decor in the front desk and restaurant areas. It's all beautiful. And I have never stayed in a hotel room with two double beds, AND two bathrooms! That was nice for our group. The concierge was great and when eating at The Gage where Angie ( the concierge) recommended, we were surprised by free glasses of champagne compliments of Angie! Thank you Angie! Have never been treated like that before!The lack of 5 stars was due to, I, like many reviews was sad that the wifi was not free in the rooms, only in the common areas of each floor. Unfortunately, our check-in gal didn't 'get it' and gave our group of three people (with a roller bed ) a small room when, two other people in our group got a larger room? The roller bed was crammed into a corner. Bummer."
"I can't say that I've had a bad experience at any Hilton property at which I've stayed, but this one was excellent. It is located about a mile from the Field Museum, Aquarium, and Planetarium, in addition to being in a safe area with lots of restaurant options nearby. The room was clean, comfortable, and had a large bathroom which made it easy for two people to get ready for the day at the same time. I was amazed at how inexpensive the nightly rate was, however, be prepared to pay an exorbitant amount of money to park your car overnight. Even though I am a Hilton Honors member, I still had to pay $52 to park overnight. Ouch! Despite that, I would absolutely stay at this hotel again when visiting Chicago."
"The only way this hotel stays busy is because of the convention center. Front desk was slow and unfriendly, Bell Hop was FABULOUS as was Valet. Rooms were very dirty (I had 5 different rooms for my team and they were all bad). Argued with the front desk on the phone because she wouldn't give me the complimentary passcode for wifi, wanted to charge me the 13/day fee. Explained my husband is a diamond member, then rudely gave it me. The Management team should be fired, this Hilton needs a fresh new start. If visiting Chicago and you have Hilton Honors, stay at the Wit. Why it's expensive...13/day for wifi, 68/day for Valet, 40 for a fridge."
"We (me and my GF) have spent five days in this hotel in sept 2014. In general it is correct, but for the money we paid, I was expecting more. Everything looks like it used to be very luxurious in the 80's. The pool is OK, but again a bit oldish. As well as the bathroom. Aaand there is no free wifi. I think this is a great hotel for a conference, because they have four floors for this purpose, but if you just want to visit Chicago, look for another hotel. However it is true it's in a nice neighbourhood, not far away from the Shedd, the planetarium, the Field museum and the Art Institute of Chicago."
"Great little boutique hotel. Nice modern feel, great facilities. Very friendly and professional staff. Easy check in/out. Location is fantastic. Right off Michigan with great restaurants and sights nearby. Easy walk down to the waterfront. Plenty of shops around, trader joes and a mall a block away. A little drawback was the small elevators. Here for business and when our meetings got out quite a line for the elevators. 2 of them and they fit probably 5-6 adults max. Comfortable bed, nice furnishings, couldn't figure out how to dim the alarm clock, nice meeting rooms. Really well done hotel."
"We enjoyed our stay at this hotel mainly because of the friendly service and the quiet rooms. We were on the 7th floor away from the lift well. the concierge couldn't help us enough and on the last day a late check out with no extra cost wasn't a problem. The rooms are a little tired, but clean. Convenient to all activities and very close to eataly! Bonus was the tea/coffee making facilities.

"My girlfriend and I stayed at the James hotel to celebrate our two year anniversary. Upon arrival we were greeted by the valet. Who was very courteous. They unloaded our bags for us. Upon check in, we were told we got an upgraded room. The room had a projector in it... Best upgrade ever. The room was very spacious. Beds were comfy! The shower had amazing water pressure. Every time we left the building the staff made it a point to make sure we enjoyed Chicago, suggesting places to eat and see. Absolutely blown away by the service of this hotel. Would stay again."
"We stayed here while bringing our kids to the city for a few days on spring break. Location was perfect and I was really impressed with the people. The levels of service were excellent. Very friendly, very helpful. I can't say that enough. The rooms were definitely on the modern edge, and our room had a cool view of the skyline. The only real issue we ran across was the thermostat. We tend to like our rooms cooler, and it got on the warm side in there no matter what we set the thermo for. Not worth complaining for, but it was a minor annoyance. Other than that, and what we felt was the salty valet charge ($65), this was a great stay. We will be back, probably without the kids."
"The James tries very hard to be a hip hotel. Things such as a more plain and modern interior, 325 ml bottles of liquor (for a commensurate price) in the minibar, a shower curtain in place of a door for the hanging closet, gluten free shampoo (!), a sliding bathroom door with frosted port hole window in place of a door, and a flat, wide bathroom sink (not as functional for draining the shaving cream) all add to the feel of the hotel. It was very comfortable, with excellent service. If you like this type of style, you will like this hotel. Good location for River North and Michigan Avenue."
"So the holiday inn is down the street and they have a complimentary breakfast.With that being said, the james is a decent. Comfy beds and clean. Anywhere you stay in that area is going to be a little noisy because Chicago Fire is nearby.We checked out both the studio and the loft. So the loft faces other rooms within the same building plus air conditioners. The studios are a tad smaller and face the street. The staff is nice. They have umbrellas to borrow. They have a complimentary car which is scheduled on a first come first serve basis. We used it just to go to other points within the city. They do not travel to he airport. We used uber for transport to the airport. The hotel had a coupon which saved me $20. So from the hotel to mdw, it was about$1.67 after applying the coupon."
"Spent three nights at The James for business. Beware, the rooms can be quirky since it is an older building. Preferred the King Deluxe to a Queen Studio (more space, but tighter fit due to room shape). The gym is okay, but in a basement area that does not have windows. There's something that makes working out more of an experience with natural light. A true boutique hotel. I would avoid the hotel restaurant, David Burke Prime."
"We all (3 adults, 1 child) really enjoyed our stay at The James Chicago. The room was plenty large enough for our needs, it was very clean, beds very comfortable, quiet, etc. The location worked out great for our trip allowing us to explore the areas off of Michigan Ave, enjoy coffee at Eataly, etc. The concierge was very helpful in recommending restaurants in the area - including a local family Italian place what was quite good. They were also very helpful with the Lil-James service for my nephew (8yr old) in that they brought him cookies, milk, and coloring books as part of a turn down services - which he really enjoyed. We did enjoy breakfast one morning in the restaurant and the food & service were also really good and would be recommended. We did get a great deal on our stay off of one of the Secret deals which made this an even more spectacular deal in regards to the level of services and compared to normal prices, etc. We did drive and found the place is easily, but we did not use their valet (so I can't comment on their services, but if they are at the level of the rest of the doormen, staff, etc - you probably can't go wrong) - rather I parked at a garage right on the next block, just a very short walk away that also had in/out privileges. Overall, I would highly recommend The James Chicago if you're looking for a really nice hotel with a great service team and a location close to Michigan Ave and all the neighborhood has to offer. I look forward to staying again this summer, etc and maybe taking advantage of access to bikes, and other services, etc.

"Great location. The rooms with two double beds are quite large. The key factor for me is how quiet the hotel is. I couldn't hear my neighbors at all, or hear anyone outside in the hallway. The beds are very comfortable, and you have three different types of pillows to choose from. The towels are very soft, and the bathroom is quite modern. I have nothing bad to say about this hotel, and I would stay here again."
"My husband and stayed at The James for two nights in April. We booked this hotel through Travelocity's Secret deals and got it for a great rate! The location is great. Just a couple of short blocks away from the L-train and from Michigan Ave. We didn't go to the bar or the restaurant inside the hotel so I cannot comment on them and we didn't spend too much time in the room because there is just so much to see and do in Chicago. However, the bed and pillows were some of the most comfortable I have ever had in a hotel anywhere. My only cons were minor. The room, #803, lacked a regular chair to sit in. There was a small couch and table in the room but you couldn't view the TV from that area. That only left the bed to sit on. A chair with back support is definitely needed in my opinion. Also, the bathroom door had a noticeable squeak that could use some attention. Other than those minor inconveniences, this was a great hotel and we would not hesitate to return to this hotel next time we are in Chicago."
"Our stay at the James Chicago was excellent. The location was perfect - we could not ask for a better spot. And the service and attentiveness by the staff was wonderful. They sent a complimentary birthday tray, with wine and chocolates, to our room and that helped get the weekend off to a wonderful start. The shower is great, the beds are very comfortable and we had everything we needed. While the rooms are a bit small, there was nothing missing. I would most certainly stay there again on my next trip to Chicago!!"
"I had a staff member walk into my room while I was showering (my family had stepped out to grab food). He did one quick knock as he was letting himself in. He said that I had called for someone to come up. I NEVER did. I told the front desk staff, and they did not seem to care about my worries. I was told that I would receive a phone call right away to let me know why he had came in. I NEVER GOT THE CALL. The next day I went back down to ask about it and was told ""he is very sorry and he was there to program the TV"" It was the most unsafe feeling I have ever had in a hotel. I would not recommend women to stay at this hotel!"
"My husband and I stayed at The James for one night this past weekend and I would definitely stay again. The location cannot be beat - one block to Michigan Avenue and near River North - Eataly, great restaurants, etc. We had a work event at the House of Blues and it was easily walkable. Enjoyed a drink at the Jimmy bar and a delicious brunch at David Burke's the following day. The hotel is filled with unique art and is comfortably modern. The rooms are very nice, albeit a bit stark. The bed was one of the most comfortable hotel beds I've ever slept in. Self parking right across the street, as well as a Trader Joe's."
"I stayed at the James this past weekend and enjoyed my visit from start to finish. The hotel is beautiful and unique with original artwork in the halls and guest rooms. The staff were knowledgeable, friendly and professional. The hotel had everything we could've wanted. The beds were very comfortable with 3 types of pillows to choose from, the windows opened to allow a nice breeze and the sounds from the street below. The soap and shampoo are amazing! I highly recommend this hotel to anyone who wants a nice, clean, upscale stay in Chicago."
"We stayed for 4 nights over the Easter Weekend and it exceeded our expectations. We were given a complimentary upgrade to an apartment and it was just incredible, a comfortable King size bed, a living room with a couch separate sitting/dining area, wet bar, large bathroom with a walk in shower. The service was fantastic, yet unobtrusive. Incredible location within minutes walk to shopping, tourist attractions and entertainment districts such as the rush village and with a short walk to Grand and State L train station on the Red Line. We'd stay again for sure."
"I stayed at this hotel on a business trip for four days. Hotel was convenient to shopping and restaurants. Christine made sure that I had a comfortable and spacious room and upon check out gave me her business card for future visit requests. Hotel and room were very clean. The bellman/doorman service was superior. Special thanks to Bernie, Jose and especially Lucas who always made sure I had ice when I walked back into the hotel. He also provided me with a nice brush and comb set when I asked where I could buy one:-) Overall customer service was outstanding!"
"We pricelined this hotel for the quality and location, so we didn't choose it. But we are glad it was given to us and would definitely stay there again. Check-in was easy, and we got to enjoy some interesting artwork in the lobby area. We were given a studio. The room was beautiful, if you like modern artsy decor. The light fixtures were all different, but they went well together. Honestly, it was the most interesting use of lighting I've ever seen in a hotel. My fiance and I actually spent a moment checking all the switches and dimmers. Same for the furniture. I absolutely loved the wooden end table. Bed was comfy. Bathroom had an interesting sliding door. The bathroom also had sulfate / paraben / silicone free toiletries. As a curly girl, I always pack my own stuff, but this is one of the only hotels that actually had nice toiletries I could use. Nice big bathrobes too.There was also a wet bar. We didn't use the fancy booze, but apparently if you want to pay for it, a bartender will come to your room and make you a drink. There is a minifridge full of stuff that we didn't try.The service was really nice - all employees were the right amount of friendly. I mentioned that we had just gotten engaged (it was true!), and when we came back to our room in the evening, there was a bottle of Martini & Rossi Asti on ice waiting for us. It came with a card congratulating us, which I thought was so sweet. Bartender was able to recommend good beers to us, and let's not forgot that many hotel bars don't even have interesting craft beer. It had a nice relaxed vibe, which was a nice way to finish out the evening.Check-out was late - 3pm, same as check-in. The later check-out was really convenient for my fiance and me, since we'd had a late night! Really, it was all of these little things added up, nice little touches and luxuries that you just don't expect to have at most hotels. I'm so glad that we ended up with the James for such a special weekend; I have a feeling it's going to become our regular Chicago hotel."
"My room was shaped like Oklahoma with a couch and giant size TV in the panhandle, meaning I was so close to the screen it felt like an IMAX. Lighting is so moody I was glad I'd packed my night vision goggles. (Business trip. Don't ask what business I'm in).There is a well stocked minibar and Pizza Uno delivers there, so I ordered their smallest pizza pie and lived off it for three days, plus another two purely running down the fat reserves it stored around my heart. Deelicious. I think it's the only hotel they deliver to, presumably because their delivery people collapse under the weight of pizza goodness otherwise. And the soaps are nice. Something fancy, I expect. They removed all the evidence off my skin. Like I said, business trip."

"I stayed at this hotel for a week for business, it's right in downtown and convenient to all the clients I had to visit. The hotel is contemporary, but not too modern - a good medium, clean and nice. The bed is extremely comfortable. I typically don't sleep well in hotels but this made it very easy and relaxing. I actually wonder if they sell their pillows because I would definitely buy some. The room service is so nice, the food is really great. The downstairs restaurant is one of the best steakhouses in Chicago so that's a good topping to the cake. To be honest, the room service workers and the door men are much nicer than the people at the front desk. Everyone is pleasant, but the workers that have to work for tips put the front desk to shame. They should try switching up the jobs. All in all, the hotel is very nice and very accommodating and very comfortable. I visit Chicago often so I will definitely be returning here."
"Ideally located 1 block west of Michigan Ave., this lovely boutique hotel has a contemporary flare with personal and friendly service. My wife and I, with our two young sons, stayed here in between moving houses. We enjoyed one of the ""loft"" rooms with two beds and a crib. One of the hotel employees helped set up a projector DVD player so our 3 year old could watch cartoons. Room service, though not cheap, was delicious. I would absolutely stay here again."
"My partner and I come to Chicago several times a year. We love the City. We have stayed in many downtown Hotels. During our most recent visit, we stayed at the James Hotel, who proved to be a Pleasant Hotel Surprise in Chicago."" From the moment of our arrival, when an attendant moved the rotating outer door for us, to check out, the staff could not have been more friendly, professional, and knowledgeable. The room we stayed in was large with a very comfortable king bed (per our request). We loved many electrical outlets scattered along all of the four walls. The TV screen was larger and had better definition than most. And, the hotel really won our hearts when they gave us a 2 PM checkout in response to our phoning to let them know we were running a little late. On the minus side (small points), the bathroom had a strange shower head than lacked vertical tilt; and also we found a lack of counter space to place our Doppler kits. And I found the chair a bit low. But, I would still rate the hotel a ""5"" on a five point scale (""5"" highest) because the plusses so far surpassed the minuses. The hotel is in an excellent location -- Ontario, one block west of Michigan. And again, the service was staff was exceptionally good. We thoroughly enjoyed the lodging experience.T"

"The James Hotel in Chicago is a well located and smart place to stay. I was here in January 2015 for 7 nights and I had a very good stay.The James gave me a good room on the 10th floor with some nice decor, furniture and a great bathroom. bed was excellent. The hotel provide hot coffee every morning and there was hot apple cider every afternoon. Plus newspapers. This is all free although you need to get them from the lobby. The only drawback to this is having to get dressed and out shoes on before you can have your first fresh brew of the day! There was also a fresh jug of drinking water in the room every day. There is free wifi.The room was cleaned and tidied every day by the staff, and the reception and door staff were always polite and helpful, and I can't think of anything missing in the room, apart from a coffee maker. I have no idea if The James has a restaurant as I never saw it, nor was I offered any option to eat meals or breakfast in the hotel. So I cannot comment on the food quality or price (if there is any)The James is about two blocks walk form the closest L train station , which is no hardship at all, and I found no trouble getting to and from the hotel to the airport. Although all the door staff seem to assume you will need a taxi every time you leave the place. There are places to eat nearby and you really are very central, close to Millenium Park, The Loop and the main shopping strip. I enjoyed staying here. Thanks to the location you can get anywhere in central Chicago from here.

"We stayed at The James Chicago about a year ago. We couldn't think of a reason to stay anywhere else for this visit. It's a cool hotel in a fantastic location. The restaurant at the hotel is great. The rooms are clean and nice. Service across the board is excellent. The nightly rate is very reasonable. My only complaint would be the $60 per night valet parking fee. Considering it's only about $140 / night, $60 seems a bit steep."
"Absolutely loved our stay. We have been coming to the James since 2007 and I don't see that changing any time soon. Always greeted by the amazing concierge when coming upon arrival. Scott has been there since the beginning and just the friendliest person. We always started our evenings at the Lobby bar and sometimes ending them there as well, and every one there is just outstanding. Teyo is there to make you happy with any special requests you might have. Excellent service from entire Staff at David Burke's Prime House. Not to mention that the food here is absolutely amazing!We loved everything about our stay and cannot wait to return to celebrate my 40th at the James Chicago and Prime House!"
"One star only because the staff was extremely polite and very nice! On check in the kids got activity kits in cute orange bags but it was downhill after that. As we got to the room the kids spotted a couple of cockroaches! Yikes ( and yes we do have photos of the litte creepy crawlies as well)! On calling the front desk they mentioned rains could have been the cause, the building has been built in the 1920's and stuff happens.Not a very satisfactory response however they immediately change our room and were very apologetic! On checking in to the next room we got the water started to fill the bathtub for the kids and there was black debris coming out of the faucet. Another call to the front desk and they sent somebody up to fix it immediately - they did get it resolved and said they do not have this happen too often however, in the 9 years he has been with the James it has happend 3 times. We were told the rooms are connected and it was back flow! Did not make me feel good about our stay! Maybe it was bad luck but this was more than I could handle and I did not think I was being in reasonable. Also, this hotel does not have a pool... They send you across the street to use one. All this said the location was fabulous and the only saving grace."
"I had a wonderful 1-night stay at The James on a business trip to Chicago. I had checked in online prior to my arrival and informed the hotel I'd be arriving late. I received an SMS with my room information, which was a nice assurance that my room wouldn't be given away. When I arrived, the bellman noticed my name on my baggage tags and radioed the front desk to let them know I was there. I was greeted, room key in hand, by an attendant and escorted to the elevators. I couldn't have wished for a better experience, as I arrived after midnight due to a flight delay! The room was very comfortable. I appreciated the abundance of power outlets, the carafe of water on the night stand, and the SmartTV (which seemed to function more like a regular TV without the typical lag of hotel televisions). Checkout was also straightforward, as my folio was left beneath the door in the morning & I enjoyed the complimentary coffee in the lobby on my way out. Overall, I was delighted by the service, attention to detail and hospitality. I will certainly return on future visits to Chicago."
"This was my first time staying at The James Chicago. The decor of the hotel is great. The king room was of modern decor; very stylish. Excellent house keeping. They returned my dry cleaning on the same day. The room was cleaned daily.I had a bad experience with my meal from room service. The manager immediately took the charge off my bill and offered me another meal at no charge.The food in the resturant was excellent. The filet mignon was cooked perfectly, my meal was outstanding. The king crab and the bass fish was excellent. The ceasar salad that was prepared at the table was fabulous. A must try. You will not be disappointed with the meals in the resturant.I received less that quality service at the bar, the resturant manager immediately handled the situation and sent drinks and desert to my room.The service was so great, I cancelled my reservation at another Chicago Hotel and I will be returning to The James Chicago on Dec. 7, 2014All the staff members are very attentive to your needs

"I stayed here for a weekend trip to Chicago for shopping Black Friday weekend. This hotel has a great location, great ambience, great rooms.....but be careful. After reading reviews before booking I saw a few people complain about phantom honor bar charges. Those people are just the complaining type, right? Wrong, checked my bill today and sure enough even though we hadn't so much as looked at the honor bar, we were charged. Good thing I had snapped a picture with my phone before leaving the room.....The front desk says they will reverse the charge....its sad that Ill have to check my statement again to find out since I don't trust them.....My advice, stay somewhere else until they get their customer service straightened out...."
"My wife and I just completed a two night stay at the James. It was absolutely wonderful. The staff was very friendly and helpful. The room was clean and roomy. The bedding was very comfortable and the wife can't stop talking about the bathroom - the shower was very nice and the shampoo, conditioner and body wash were great. The hotel is in a great location. We were able to walk to everything we needed. 10-15 minute walk to Daley Plaza for the Christmas Market and to the Theater District. Very close to shopping and several great dining options. We visited Eataly (right next door) and dined at Prime. We would highly recommend this hotel for all these reasons. We look forward to a future stay at the James!"
My first time back in Chicago in quite some time and I am truly glad my girlfriend chose this terrific property. The staff was terrific... the room was spacious and felt like home and the location was perfect for walking everywhere... which is what we did. Stop in the restaurant near the lobby for an amazing breakfast or any other meal and feel at home in this terrific property. Not one complaint and I will absolutely stay with them again when I get the chance.
"Having stayed at other properties when in the Chicago are - The Fairmont Millennium Park and The Drake - this is the second time I choose The James over other properties. Its location cannot be beat! It is at the corner of Rush and Ontario, a block from all the shopping on Michigan Avenue, a few more blocks from all the high-end stores on Oak Street, to say nothing of all the boutiques on State Street. You are surrounded by a variety of dining options, from their own in-house David Burke's Primehouse, to the Mexican place Su Casa next door, to the legendary Pizzeria Due, to our favorite champagne place, Pops! The rooms are open layout concept with minimalist decor. The studios have a living room and a pantry ideal for making your own drinks (they thoughtfully stock generously-sized spirits and bartender-ready mixing tools). The room is dressed in natural colors, with a floor-to-ceiling mirror, and decorated with modern art pieces (we recognized the Michael Kenna photographs over our bed!). The bathroom is serviceable and eco-conscious utilizing full-sized Intelligent Nutrients bath products (attached to the shower wall). There is - unlike the major chains - free wifi and complimentary distilled water.The property has a gym and a spa that we did not have the chance to utilize. It also offers a complementary car service and bikes, which we also did not have a chance to use - we are walkers and walked everywhere.The staff - from the front desk to housekeeping to the valet guys - is courteous, helpful and super friendly. Everything from upgrading our room and delivering replacements for forgotten toiletries to offering us water bottles as we check-out and chasing after a taxi for us in the rain. The only minor drawbacks are the lack of natural light in the rooms (if you are not on a high enough floor for a city-view) and the elevators - there are only two and they are tiny! If there are two people with sizable luggage in an elevator, you may be able to fit yourself - and only yourself in. Sometimes, this results in having to wait for longer for an elevator to become available between runs (17 floors). Not enough to keep The James from being my go-to hotel when in Chicago!


Room Tip: Request a room on one of the higher floor for the natural light.

"My two sisters and I stayed at The James on a recent weekend getaway to Chicago. We chose the hotel for the location and good reviews on Tripadvisor. Great choice. The James is very central and walking distance to everything in downtown Chicago. We walked to Magnificent Mile for shopping, walked to several great restaurants for dinner, went for a long walk near the lake front and even walked to take the architectural boat tour. The staff at The James was exceptional. Everyone we came into contact with was extremely friendly, helpful and knowledgeable --- this includes the front desk staff, the bell staff, the concierge, and the valet guys. The James is definitely an excellent option for staying in Chicago."
"This hotel is in a great location, very close to tons of shopping, restaurants, metro and walking distance to the river and the loop. Checking in was earlier than expected and the late check out at 2pm is a real plus! The room was a good size with very comfortable beds and clean as a whistle. The staff were very accommodating and helpful. Had a great experience at the bar and restaurant and felt very pampered there."
"Facilities are impeccable. Rooms extremely nice, clean, and well-appointed. But what set apart the James from other group business travel experiences I have had was their personal touch. From the valet parking to the front desk personnel to the concierge services, we found the attention to detail and courteous-yet-not-obnoxious service from the James to be outstanding.

"Facilities are impeccable. Rooms extremely nice, clean, and well-appointed. But what set apart the James from other group business travel experiences I have had was their personal touch. From the valet parking to the front desk personnel to the concierge services, we found the attention to detail and courteous-yet-not-obnoxious service from the James to be outstanding. Laurelin from concierge services was above-and-beyond helpful to me as I was unfamiliar with Chicago and trying to put together a memorable dining and entertainment experience for a small (12 people) group of people. She was a good listener -- responding quickly and specifically to the needs and interests of our group."
"Stayed here fire a single night. Great location close to the Mag Mile, but I didn't think the room was anything special (except for the various bottles of liquor available for a price in the room bar). Don't get me wrong, it was comfortable but I wouldn't pay that price again. There are similar options near the Mile for a better deal. The hotel restaurant/bar seemed to be a happening place on a Friday night. Housekeeping needs to pay more attention to detail as there was a used bar of soap waiting for us in the shower."
"Stayed here for two nights on a long-weekend treat. The location is phenomenal if high-end shopping is your thing. For me, I loved that it was within walking distance to dozens of restaurants & bars. The Grand L-train station is just a few blocks south-west and will get you to the fun stuff to the south in no time.The hotel surprised me with an upgrade from a guestroom to a loft. It was on the inside of the building and relatively quiet. The media nook was made for relaxing and had a projector. There are also large TVs in front of the bed and in the small couch + coffee table living room space. The bathroom was spacious and spotless. The soaps, shampoos, and lotion were excellent. Everything inside and outside of the room was impeccably clean. The wet bar is loaded with (probably very expensive) booze. There's a loaded mini fridge inside the wet bar cabinet, as well as an almost-hidden drawer full of snacks below the sink. For the thrifty drinker, Trader Joe's across the road sells alcohol, and The Side Door directly opposite on the corner serves some fantastic beers and cocktails. There are no ice machines. Call the front desk and they will deliver a bucket of ice to your room.Room service from Primehouse was outstanding and a great way to treat yourself. The late night menu was surprisingly good. I had a huge bowl of the house mac & cheese after arriving late and that kept me comfy for the whole night. Primehouse will only seat tables for two when you have a reservation. Or just order room service.All of the staff and housekeeping were very pleasant and helpful. My only quibble is that the room's thermostat display was a super-bright blue light. I had to fold up some pieces of paper to hang over it because it faced the bed. That aside, I'm definitely going to stay here again.


Room Tip: Higher floors if you aren't used to the city sound.

"I recently stayed at The James for a 3-day conference. I opted to stay here instead of the conference hotel which was a mere two blocks away. I had a king suite which was lovely and spacious. I had a corner room so it was nice and quiet and far from the elevators. The windows looked out into a courtyard so the only view was that of the other rooms that also looked into the courtyard. It wasn't an issue for me as I was gone from the room all day. My room had a sitting area with a small couch, chair, coffee table and flat screen TV. The couch was slightly uncomfortable if you wanted to lean back and lounge. It needed a big pillow but that was only a minor inconvenience. There was also a wet bar with a small refrigerator. The king bed was super comfy with lots of pillows. There was also a flat screen TV in the bedroom area and small bench along the window. Beware the bed frame as I smacked my shin into the corner in the middle of the night. After a long day at my conference, it was great to come back to The James and lounge on the comfy bed!I also took advantage of the Asha spa for a one-hour foot massage before I left town. I would highly recommend Marvin for your foot massage. He did a wonderful job!I had dinner one night at David Burke's Primehouse at the hotel...foie gras appetizer, 40 day ribeye, parmesan popover, mac'n cheese and cheesecake lollipops. Delicious!The James is ideally located to many restaurants and shopping and I would definitely stay here on my next trip to Chicago."
"Great modern style hotel with great staff--helpful, courteous, professional, great attitude. My husband and I were very pleased with the layout of our king bed room. It contained all the amenities of a great place to be away from home--up-to-date gadgets, fully-stocked bar and snacks, awesome shower, and a spacious room. Room service was on-time and the food was hot and tasted great! The location of the James is in the midst of all the action downtown, just down the road from the RedHead Piano Bar, great shopping on Michigan Avenue--being near shopping is always a plus! We would definitely stay there again!"
"My sheets had a hole!! I called to have them changed, they said they would and they never did. The closet is like a portable wardrobe and super tiny. The shower curtain is literally a gigantic towel; yes, that's the material of the curtain. The soap and body lotion have a disgusting smell.The person who designed the sink should be banned from designing anything again. I can't even move my hands under the water because there's no room and because it's big and square, all the dirty water stays there."
"A friend and I booked this hotel for a long weekend and it was worth every penny. We looked at this hotel mainly because of its great location and the look of the hotel seemed to be simplistic but very nice, and we were not disappointed. We traveled here to celebrate my friend's birthday so we spent a little extra to stay here and now I'm not sure if I could stay anywhere else! The rooms were simple and modern, the staff was beyond friendly and helpful, and the location is absolutely perfect. STAY HERE, trust me, you won't regret it!"
"Really good looking interiors, contemporary furnishings in room, king-size bed with fluffy white comforter wrapped in white sheets--for cleanliness, full bar, strong hot shower, lovely service all around (front desk, doormen, valets, room service), great downtown location, around the corner from Eataly Restaurant complex AND five minute drive to the Navy Pier. Would definitely stay here again.
Only cons: Electronics!...

"From the moment we stepped into The James Chicago, it was an exceptional experience. Our trip was planned as an Anniversary celebration for me and my wife, and when we checked in we told them that. And they upgraded us to a Loft - a much nicer room than we initially had booked. And with a separate area/private screening room with a Japanese bed and projector. As movie lovers, this was the perfect thing for us, to be able to watch a DVD from the comfort of our room on a big screen at the end of each day. It was awesome.The staff was exceptionally friendly and nice and we received great service all around. Laurelin Hefter, one of the concierges, was great and gave us some amazing recommendations throughout the city. We were very happy with all the options she provided to us and discovered some new places all because of her.We will be enthusiastically recommending the hotel to our friends, families and colleagues and they've made some lifelong fans. Hope to visit again in the not too distant future!"
"Stayed the James for a meeting recently and was expecting the hotel to be up to the standard of their Miami property which is very cool and creative. Unfortunately, the hotel felt tired and worn. The furniture in the lobby was not kept up and looked dirty. The guestroom loose furniture was not very comfortable especially for the business traveler. The service was very good though and the staff was really friendly and welcoming. They did call me 15 minutes late for my wake-up call but aside from this the service was very good."
"Our family of 3 (includes a 10-year-old) found the James convenient and lovely. The rooms were spacious enough for the 3 of us. The bell stand was excellent and even helped our lost Uber driver find us. And, when needing a cab on a busy Friday night, THEY offered to bring us to our dinner location in the hotel car. The location is the real selling point. The rooms are nice for an aged building, but not over the top. We had a great dinner at David Burke's restaurant. We'll stay here again. I highly recommend the James.


Room Tip: Ask for Queen beds. We had double beds and they are too small. Our room, facing south, was noisy.

"What was this lucky find, a very personalised and hospitable hotel in the US! Normally they are impersonal and staff seem so busy that one feels kinda intimidated to ask for anything! But not at The James! From arrival with the Bell Men, the Check in Staff, Room Service, Housekeeping, the Restaurant staff, all were so welcoming and warm! It felt like one was in Asia, not the US! Well done. Have to specifically mention Bill Marcella, Chief Concierge. He really knows how to take ownership of a Guest request, and deal with it. I had some couriers to do and he just helped out, without hesitation, and did it all for me. Thanks, Bill!


Room Tip: Select a external room, not a inside facing room.

"This hotel was designed to please the younger more hip traveler but there are some flaws. Dark hallways are not young and hip. They're just dark. Not having Public Television in their cable package is not young and hip, just frustrating and annoying. Having a desk attendant who never heard of Public Television, again not young or hip. Finally, having a light bar over the bed may look young and hip but it was either totally on or off and had an off and off switch on only one side of the bed. Don't they ever have couples stay? To really be a 4.5 star, the hotel needs to ramp up."
"A great hotel for a drunken party? Probably. For a business guy who wants to get work done? Absolutely not. No desk in the room, no work chair. Lighting is awful for productivity, no bed side lamp for reading. Windows are single lane, and even on the 12th floor street was very loud.That said, the hotel is in good condition, and the staff were unfailingly excellent, I just think in not in the target market for this hotel."
"We recently returned from our first trip to Chicago a long weekend at The James.The good stuff, Superb location handy for everything,nice rooms with very comfortable beds, very friendly staff.We had a couple of issues:We asked for more tea to be put in the room at least four times before eventually giving up and going over the road to buy our own!The hotel advertises a courtesy car, every time we asked if it was available it was not. One evening we asked the doorman when it was available and he said that he did not know they had one!The cocktail bar is not open every night.These may be small points but at this price they are not acceptable."
"My brother chose the James for his birthday getaway because of its location and its association with David Burke Primehouse, which is where we celebrated his 40th. The location is phenomenal, just a block off Michigan Ave in the heart of everything you want to be near. The atmosphere of the hotel is pleasant and modern, with a chic vibe that is a tad worn on the ends but not in a distracting way. Rooms have lovely amenities, seating options and very comfortable Simmons Beautyrest mattresses. There's a pillow menu. They are clean and pleasant.But what was really tremendous - moreso than any other hotel in which I've stayed - is the dedication and friendliness of the staff. From housekeeper to front desk to doormen to our bellman, Jamie, each and every person we met went above and beyond to make our stay not only comfortable but absolutely perfect. Jamie even slipped a note into my shopping bags for me to find after I returned home, thanking us for our stay, knowing I wouldn't find it until I unpacked. I cannot recommend The James highly enough. Yes, it might be a bit much to spend for some budgets - it stretches mine - but for this quality of service it's well worth it. We will absolutely return to the James and make it our home away from home in Chicago."
We chose the James for our 4 day stay in Chicago on the basis of reviews on the site and were delighted with our choice. I would sum up The James by saying it is compact (by US standards) and with all necessary facilities and nice rooms and a very good restaurant (David Burke's steak house) and well situated for big-time shopping but what makes it stand out is the quality of the service and its personal nature. It made it a real pleasure to stay there. The front of house team are exceptionally good - especially the concierge desk of Bill and Laurelin. They were both happy to ensure we got the trips we wanted and the advice we needed.
"Lovely hotel, right in the middle of town. We stayed for the marathon, and its convenient for the start and finish. Rooms spotlessly clean, very friendly and helpful staff.Only downside was the restaurant was perpetually booked out, and the prices are 5 star, but all in all, worth a stay.Very comprehensive mini bar and snack list, which even included a nice bottle of red wine, pain killers, lots of snacks and an intimacy kit, I'll leave you to guess...."
"My wife and I just returned from mid-week 25th anniversary getaway to Chicago. We picked The James because of its central location to shopping, dining and attractions. The staff at the James was outstanding - they went out of their way to make our anniversary special. Laurelin (the concierge) booked at great last minute anniversary dinner at Sepia and then had champagne and raspberry truffles waiting in our room for our return. It was a very special treat, she even told the restaurant it was our anniversary.We booked a king room with breakfast included. The room was very nice, modern decor, comfortable bed, functional bathroom with great hot water / pressure. We had great drinks in the bar upon arrival (a little pricey) and breakfast in the morning in the restaurant. Breakfast was very enjoyable - the bill was a bit more then the coupon was worth but it was worth it. The lobby staff was very helpful with information and suggestions. Something I doubt most people recognize is the hotel will give you a ride to local destinations when the SUV is available. It was great to step out the door into a car to get a ride to dinner and the train station. The driver was very friendly and informative. Overall we had a great trip to the James. We will be back.


Room Tip: Pick higher floor or room facing court yard

"We stayed four nights at the James after a three week roadtrip and, boy, was this the perfect way to end that vacation. Staff was friendly, courteous and very helpful, the room was very nice and clean and the hotel was small enough to feel personal and convivial. A unique and personal experience. Location was also great, just off the Magnificent Mile. The only downside was the automatic minibar where if you moved something, they'd charge your account. Bad for someone like me who likes to bring their own (craft) beer to the hotel..."
"Reserved a King Suite and found it to be disappointingly Spartan and as if somewhat had raced to get the suite clean. Lampshades were tilted, picture frames askew and a general tiredness to the furnishings. Gone the entire next day, came back to a room that had not been cleaned. When I called on the ONE phone that worked in the room, the individual explained rather curtly that, '' . . . housekeeping starts on the lower floors.'' When there was no response from me, she asked, . . ""Do you need someone to come up there now?"" I requested that someone just bring some fresh towels. The gentleman who came to the door a few minutes later was very apologetic, towels in hand, and asked if there was anything else that could be done. The remainder of the stay was uneventful, staff were very friendly and the room was cleaned. Went to the restaurant on two mornings, food ok, service polite but very slow. So if you're in a hurry, better go some place else.


Room Tip: Corner King Suite had lots of light, but traffic noise and dumpster trash removal could bother some...

"This is the second time I've stayed at The James and we had a great time! The hotel is in a perfect location (Starbucks and Trader Joe's across the street!) and it's easy to get to anything in Chicago. The staff is phenomenal! From booking my birthday dinner reservations at a trendy spot for me months in advance to arranging a car to get us back from a concert at the United Center - everything was awesome. Very friendly, knowledgeable, and professional. The staff at David Burke's restaurant downstairs is equally amazing! They remember your name (we were there 5 nights) and love to chat. The beds and pillows are AMAZING! Furniture is a bit uncomfortable, but we didn't spend much time in the room anyway. Looks great though! Nice little sink/bar areas. One negative is do not get a room facing inside - get one facing the street. I've stayed in 2 outside rooms and they are perfect. Those rooms are quiet. In the inside rooms (of which we tried 2) unfortunately, you either hear the regular elevator or the service elevator. Also, Saturday night was a wedding and the music was SO LOUD! We were on 14th floor too. The staff was kind enough to let us sleep in an outside room that night and not move our stuff. That never happens! Hotels usually make you haul all of your things to the new room. They were wonderful. I recommend this hotel to anyone!

The staff was notably friendly, helpful and accommodating, and extremely knowledgeable about local attractions, dining, and transportation (every food recommendation was excellent and they were great at picking good places with specific price restrictions).The room itself was nicely made up, attractive, very clean. Best of all, though, were the mattresses and stylish-yet-functional bathrooms. That's probably the best I've ever slept in a hotel!"
"Stayed at The James for a week with my husband on our first couples vacation to Chicago. We loved the central location of hotel and how we could walk to so many public attractions, shopping and restaurants. The staff were very friendly and helpful. I had booked the stay in advance but had some questions about logistics. Laurelin helped us with our questions and everything went smoothly. We would definitely stay here again."
"I just returned from my Chicago getaway and stayed at The James three out of four nights. I could not be happier with my choice and wish I would have stayed the 4th night as well.Location is excellent for walking to nearby shopping and restaurants. There is a bus stop about a block away. There are several taxis nearby at all times, so you'll never be waiting more than a minute or two for one to show up. The staff was absolutely wonderful the entire time. Very helpful with food/drink suggestions, directions, and everyone was very friendly and professional.My room (1717) was high enough I didn't hear a lot of street noise. An occasional siren or honking, but certainly not enough to wake me at any point during the night. The view wasn't exceptional, but was nice at night. The room was super clean and well-kept. Housekeeping came daily while I was out and about, so I came back every evening to a clean room and refilled water. The beds were nice and comfortable. The room decor was simple and modern. This will be my definite go-to hotel for any future stays in Chicago.


Room Tip: I would suggest rooms on higher floors to limit street noise.

"Great location, appealing clean decor, green and healthy offerings, exceptionally friendly and attentive staff, comfy bed, art on the walls. Very well stocked, way over-priced mini bar. Did not eat in the restaurant, but the conference food was good to my taste (though too ""healthy"" for some attendees, e.g. scambled egg whites and turkey bacon for breakfast, kashi bars for morning snack, lots of salad.)"
"Stayed a few nights for a conference that was at the hotel. The decor and furniture were modern and comfortable. Very Eco-friendly : the linens, bath products (gluten free shampoo!), tap water in a carafe instead of plastic bottled water - but the shower faucet was leaky (wasting water!). The bed, pillows, and other furniture were very comfortable. The room service menu was limited, but available 24/7. Only complaint was the street noise, although I suspect higher floors may not have this problem (I was on 5)"
"Located just a few blocks of Michigan Avenue north of the river, this hotel is ideally situated. It's far enough off the beaten path that you aren't fighting the pedestrians and tourists, yet close enough to the best shopping on Michigan Avenue and State Street. There are plenty of fantastic restaurants within walking distance.The exterior of the hotel is unassuming - big, brick, old. But when you step into the lobby, you are transported to a modern urban oasis. The space is bright and warm with modern lines, dark wood, comfortable leather chairs, and impressive art installations that rotate regularly.Every single staff person I encountered was a joy - helpful, friendly, professional.The hotel even has a complimentary luxury SUV that will drop you off anywhere you want to go within a predetermined radius of the hotel.I stayed in a king bedded junior suite looking out onto the courtyard. The decor was bright, clean, subdued and modern. The bed was exceedingly comfortable, bathroom was a bit cozy but well lit and well appointed with plenty of counter space and a large shower.The sofa was hard and uncomfortable to sit on for an extended period of time, but I didn't visit Chicago to sit in my hotel room watching TV.I found it odd that a junior suite didn't have a desk or workstation...The hotel's fitness center was fairly extensive - as a regular gymrat, I was impressed with the selection of equipment. I was able to get in regular workouts.I would definitely stay here again.


Room Tip: For quiet, request a courtyard facing room.

"The James is an interesting property in a city that's famous for design. Extensive and classy renovation but at times form seems to trump function. Like why have ice buckets when there are no ice machines? Or chairs that may look stylish but are seriously uncomfortable. (Chairs inbthe conference rooms are only slightly better, with low backs and very little padding that make forbade long day.)On the other hand the service is impeccable. They seemed happy to deliver ice (I later found out that they do have ice on some floors-like the 6th--in insulated chests, but that's apparently a secret), as well as memory foam pillows, a very nice touch. All the staff is interacted with were both friendly and helpful. And the location is great."
"I enjoyed our stay at this hotel. It wasn't perfect, but the bed was super-comfortable and the staff was very responsive to any issue we brought up, as well as friendly. Two complaints-- a smell (likely of cleaning chemicals) upon entering the room and no vegan items on the restaurant and room service menus (something that doesn't matter to everyone but does to me), but the location is great and the bathroom very nice. On the whole, I would gladly go back."
"This was our first time staying at The James Hotel. We were very impressed with the professionalism of the staff and cleanliness of the rooms. The hotel is located just off the Magnificent Mile, close to both upscale and believe it or not, outlet shopping. Lots of restaurants within walking distance, everything from ultra expensive to McDonald's. The decor is contemporary and rooms very comfortable, with a small refrigerator, coffee pot and snacks for purchase. The beds are heavenly! Best night's sleep I've had in a long time. Check-in and check-out time is 2:00 pm, which made it nice on both the day we arrived and the day we left. All in all, a great place to stay."
"I am in Chicago fairly often and have stayed at The James regularly since first discovering it. The understated elegance of the place has always impressed me. It's not flashy but everything is well designed and extremely comfortable. Last time I was there I forgot my my keys in my room on departure, and they were found for me and shipped back more or less instantly by the concierge Laurelin Hefter. Just cemented their reputation as my favourite hotel in Chicago."
"The James Hotel Chicago is the Best all-around hotel in Chicago! The location can't be beat - great restaurants and bars nearby, shopping on the Mag Mile, close to public transportation. But what really makes this hotel the best is their staff and the service they provide. Their staff has always been friendly, even when I've booked a room through a travel website rather than directly with them. They're always ready to make your stay better than expected, whether giving recommendations on places to go, making your room more comfortable, or taking you to your destination in their courtesy car. The James staff is truly committed to exceptional customer service. I'm already planning my next stay!"
"I just stayed at The James for a girls weekend and it was great. I do not think you could be in a better location! We walked everywhere and did not need a taxi at all! They have bikes, but you must reserve ahead of time. The concierge is very helpful as well. I had read a review on TripAdvisor that this was a fantastic location and it is!!!The room was nice, the service was great and the location was perfect."
"But with The James it is a huge advantage. I'm not very familiar with the city but this turned out to be about as close to everything as it's possible to get...and still be quiet and peaceful.A friend who had lived in Chicago was visiting the city a few weeks later and I recommended The James. He knew the property by name only. He reported back that it was the best location that any visitor could wish for - which coming from an ex-resident confirmed what I'd thought. But, location is not everything that makes for a happy stay. Fortunately The James offers more and it's staff go the extra mile to make sure your stay is as comfortable as possible. From the door staff to the housekeeping service they could not have been more helpful.I later discovered this to be true of other Denihan Group hotels. I guess it's the training.The suite was spacious and beautiful with little extras - like a 'welcome' note and turn down service - that go to make a stay memorable. However, these days we expect comfort, clean functional bathrooms and crisp linen and ample towels as the norm and we can even pick our hotels by location (thank you Google Maps). The James provided all of this. During our stay we looked into five rooms on our floor and all were of the same high standard.So what makes a difference to the experience comes down to the staff. The staff at The James were not just the icing on the cake - they were also the cherry on the top.It really isn't all about location....We shall certainly come again."
"Just returned home from a week in Chicago and we stayed at this great hotel. We booked the James based on reviews which we had read on tripadvisor as we didn't know the area. What a great location to find ourselves in. We had our pregnant daughter in law with us on holiday and we were thinking we would have to use a taxi most of the time but this was not the case as we were in walking distance of some great shopping, great restaurants and some bars. The staff at the James are so helpful and friendly and would do anything for you to make your stay enjoyable. A special mention to the housekeeping staff who did a wonderful job on our room everyday. From check in to check out I can honestly say we had no complaints about the hotel. Just a little bit of advise to the bar manager, extend your last call at the bar as we did notice a few disappointed guests looking for a drink on their return back to the hotel at nightime, although they all had a mini bar in their room, but sometimes its nice to have your nightcap before you go to your room. I would have no hesitation recommending the James to any of our friends and family and we would book it again if we decide to return to Chicago."
"The building was probably constructed as Howard Johnson's or similar as, although it's hip, cool and trendy, it doesn't have the build quality of other hotels for the same price locally. The beds and linens are very comfy but I do miss the turn down that was standard last year but the sofa in the suites is an instrument of torture so you mostly spend time on the bed. Great staff and location, go for a fun weekend not an extended stay."
"Had a really exceptional stay at the James in Chicago. First of all, the hotel is located in the miracle mile shopping district. I enjoyed being so close to so many unique shops and national chain luxury stores. The hotel is absolutely unique. I found that the hotel staff went out of their way to make sure our stay was comfortable. I found the traffic a bit busy in front of the hotel, however, the bell staff worked hard to clear waiting cars. I loved the turn down service, and the hot pastries left on my pillow in the evenings. It is so nice to return to the room and find subdued lighting and a nice treat. They have really exceptional bath products and fluffy towels. I would recommend this hotel to anyone travelling to Chicago. One tip, make sure you eat downstairs at the steakhouse, it was one of the best dinners that I've had."
I really enjoyed this unique hotel! I went here with my son and only stayed one night but it was still great! They have a driver that will take you one way where ever you want to go (within reason) and he was very friendly! The location is super! We went to the Eataly which I highly recommend! The beds are comfy and you have a free bottle of water on the table waiting for you. The front desk people were very nice too. I'd stay there again! :)
"My husband has to travel to Chicago for business often and sometimes I fly in for a long weekend. One such weekend we stayed at The James and it has become one of our favorite hotels. It is a great location. There is only valet parking but it is located within walking distance of shopping, eating and lots of tourist attractions so you will probably never even ask for your car. Rooms are very comfy and the service was good. The number of excellent restaurants within walking distance is vast. We did get charged twice for valet so be sure and check your bill before leaving. They quickly corrected it when we showed them. If you have never stayed down town Chicago be prepared to hear sirens and vehicles all night."
"my husband and I were going to Chicago on business and we decided to go a couple of days early to celebrate my 50th birthday and booked at the The James Chicago after reading trip advisor reviews and I am so happy that I did. I advised them that it was my birthday and upon arrival, there were cupcakes in the room to wish me a good one. The room was very modern and comfortable, the hotel was close to everything you could possibly imagine. I had sent a note prior to arrival indicating that we would arrive early and if you could check in early it would be appreciated, and they filled that request. Every single employee was willing to help with any possible question that we could possibly have. All very friendly and made me feel welcome. I could not have hoped for better. We left the windy City and agreed that we would be back and we will definately be back at the James."
"It was our first stay here and we stayed in the king bed apartment with the bedroom and living area separate. We had a great view of the city at night. Loved that the windows open as I love fresh air. I also loved that the room was separated as we were traveling with an infant and a 4 yr old. The infant slept with us and the 4yr old on the requested roll away bed. Room had plenty of space which was great and the price was not too bad I thought, though it was the day after Labor Day. My favorite part though was the 2pm check in and check out time. Finally, a hotel that you can spend a whole 24 hours a day in. Plus our flight wasn't till 6pm so that really helped. Only downside is the $60 a day for parking. Ouch!!"
"I enjoy boutique hotels and was rather disappointed with The James. Let's start with the good. I found it to be a convenient location, 1 mile walk from Art Institute and very close to the beaches and lake shore walks. It is around the block from Eataly, which was hands down one of the best culinary experiences of my life (it's a must). The door men were wonderful as were the young men at the front desk. I truly appreciated the fresh, cold water available at the front desk (I explored the city almost entirely by foot, so the water was much needed). The AC in the room worked extremely well. We like it cold. The not so good - the unconventional art in the lobby is very disjointed. With no theme connecting the decor it feels like an odd space that you don't want to spend much time in. It's as if someone said, well these are all strange things to display so it will look cool. But it doesn't. Concierge seemed too busy to assist me, wasn't welcoming or hospitable. Elevators are very slow. The couch in the room was for looks only, it was too uncomfortable to sit on. There was only one night stand for the bed. Awkward layout made it a not-so-comfortable room. Not the worst place but I will stay elsewhere next time I visit Chicago."
"We held our wedding reception here 4 years ago, and returned for our 4th anniversary for a night's stay. Everything was as we remembered it, though they now carry another toiletry provider (used to be Kiehl's products, it is now something else. The products weren't quite as good, but they were still very nice). The hotel overall is fantastic, everything is meticulously maintained and the staff make an amazing effort to ensure the comfort of their guests. We dined at David Burke for dinner, since the kitchen catered our wedding reception. The steak was even better than we remembered it, and our server was amazing. It was a GREAT experience, and we can't wait to come back again another year to celebrate. Can't recommend The James enough."
"Staying in deluxe room as complained about standard room due to outlook, small size and darkness.
Happily upgraded, but honestly not much different.
Rooms very functional, clean and very comfortable. Choice of pillows and great maid service. Bed very comfortable and clean.
Room service excellent standard and prompt.
Location excellent and staff very happy to accommodate requests.
Would recommend."

"Stayed for 3 nights recently. Great location. Did not get to try the restaurant but sat at bar two nights and wished we had been able to dine, too. Bar tenders very accommodating to our requests and remembered our previous night's orders. Rooms, service and cleanliness were top notch all the way around. Laurelin Hefter, the concierge, was about as good as you can get. She was very helpful and patient with all of our requests for info. Will definitely stay there on our next trip to Chicago."
"Stayed here 1 night mid-week in August.Room was very nice. Very large by Chicago standards.Bathroom was good. Shower was average with good water pressure. Bed was extremely comfortable.Gym was looks well equipped but of the ~4-5 treadmills, one didn't work. TV's didn't work on any of the others.Evening concierge was not helpful. Asked for directions to a nearby restaurant and she pointed. No map, no attempt to look up directions.Day concierge was extremely helpful on the phone. Recommended a great place for breakfast and laid out several options.Overall, a great value and location but service was average."
"The location could not be better --- but the service is lacking completely. We stayed at the hotel the weekend of July 26. We had prepaid for an upgraded room and then been upgraded from that. Check-in is at 3 pm - but our rooms weren't ready until 7 pm. The front desk made constant excuses and then gave us cards for free drinks in the bar. We went to the bar to use the drink tickets and were told they were no good after we ordered $60 worth of drinks for 4 people. When we finally got to the room it was apparent the ventilation/AC wasn't working. The front desk staff and management did very little, even the next day. Our valet was comped. I did the online review and was honest and then Christine Helin, the front desk mgr, immediately followed up with an email, apologized, and said she was sending a certificate for a free night. That was several weeks ago and we have received NOTHING. I have followed up with her on telephone and email and there has been NO response. Pretty apparent this was just lip service.The location of this property is incredible. I just wish the service and decor and cleanliness matched the amazing location."
"I stayed at the James Hotel Aug 6-8. The hotel was able to provide an early check in with 15 minutes of my arrival. The hotel is of the minimal persuasion, but that is of my liking. My room was on the 8th floor away from the elevators. I was able to sleep restfully each evening. Complimentary newspapers (Wall Street Journal, USA Today and Chicago Tribune) were available each day. The Steakhouse is on the expensive side within the restaurant, but the location is outstanding being one block off of the Magnificent Mile. Complementary rides within the CBD are available through the front desk. Bicycles are available to use as we'll complementary. Water (triple filtered) is available in your room (also complementary). I was pleased the hotel as a 2:00 pm check out, yes 2:00 pm! This was greet to wrap up a noon conference then return to the hotel to check off. The front desk was very helpful. Taxis ready if you need them. I would recommend this hotel!"
"Stayed at The James for a 3 day business trip. I felt like someone special from the time I got out of the taxi. When I had arrived, I realized that I lost my driver's license somewhere from the time I got on the plane until check-in when the associate asked me for ID. The concierge was very helpful in providing me with phone numbers to call to report lost and found. She was very sympathetic and was full of positive energy, that I didn't let it spoil the whole trip. The room was very comfortable and a little eclectic. Had a very hip ambiance. View was not so great as I was looking at the back of another building. Also, I was a little annoyed that I was charged $40 for damaged linen (fitted sheet only). Room rate was not bad because I got the conference rate.But, the hotel hosted the conference very well. And felt special even when checking out and hopping into the taxi to get back to the airport."
"My stay at the James, in June was made more pleasant by the friendly and efficient staff. The room was comfortable with good linens, towels and amenities. This is not a luxury hotel, but it is a welcoming and comfortable one. The location is perfect for shopping, museums, dining, etc. Laurelin Hefter, the concierge, was most helpful and the restaurant staff made dining a treat. I hope to return many times."
"This was my 1st time in Chicago and this hotel helped make it more than a work trip. Room was very clean and comfortable, staff was attentive, food was delicious! I would definitely stay here again. Our conference was held at the James and everything was well done. Our breakfasts and lunches were wonderful! And the one night we had dinner was magnificent! Order the filet. It was cooked to perfection!

"We stayed at The James because they have a decent military discount, which was greatly appreciated. The staff was all friendly but didn't go out of their way to make us feel welcome. I had talked to the front desk a couple of days before our arrival to let them know we were in the city as a way to keep my friend's mind off of the fact that her husband had just been deployed to the Middle East and would be gone for over a year. I had hoped they would help us 'celebrate' and I even asked about paying for an upgrade, but they were not helpful at all. Our room was at the very end of the hall and looked over a roof, but because we weren't in our room much, it wasn't a huge deal. The bathrooms are nice and all of the mirrors are wonderful for two women to get ready! The location is ideal if you are planning on shopping on Michigan Avenue and also using the subway.We had a nice time, nothing spectacular, but I would stay again if the price was right."
"Overall I had a very good stay at the James. It was in a very convenient location, and I had efficient and pleasant interactions with staff. I also appreciated the amenities and wish I could have taken advantage of the spa. A discount coupon for the spa and a mini area map included with the room key were nice touches. The hotel artwork and decor were also a change from the more typical sterile hotel environments. Definitely recommend this hotel."
"I enjoyed the stay, the location and the room. The noise, however, was terrible. We were placed in a king room on the fifth floor and heard a lot of street noise all night.After we arrived home from our 3 night stay, we found out that we were charged twice for the entire stay. I called the hotel to inquire about the charge so they could remove it and they said that they only charged me once. I had to go through a chargeback process with American Express in order to get the charge removed. When I spoke with American Express, they confirmed that the hotel had ran my card twice within seconds of each other. An unfortunate and inconvenient end to an otherwise nice stay."
"Being one of the few hotels with rooms available in the mag mile area when I booked, I didn't expect too much from this place. It really surpassed my expectations. Service was superb, room was clean, in good condition, well stocked. Great beds & linens. The location couldn't be better. The only thing I would complain about is that I would have liked them to have a preferred parking garage, and to offer a parking voucher for at least 1 night's parking fees. $115 for 2 nights of parking can really cut into a trip budget. Regardless, I would definitely stay here again.


Room Tip: Room 917 was one of the farthest from the elevators, and had no view, but was very quiet.

"My husband and I celebrated our anniversary at The James over a 3 night stay. I can honestly say we had a wonderful experience. Even before our stay, the concierge, Laurelin, was incredibly helpful and kind in setting up our dinner reservations, making excellent suggestions as to places that fit the type of food, atmosphere and budget we wanted. Nothing was too much to ask for, nothing was impossible. She made our stay great from the moment we contacted her.The rooms at The James have a modern style yet maintain a sense of luxury. Everything was clean--not a speck of dust anywhere. A carafe of water is replenished daily, and the mini bar is well stocked, if a bit pricey. We didn't need or want anything in it anyway. Our bed was super comfortable, after a long day walking it felt great to lay down! We had a quiet room on the 10th floor and never heard any other guests.We did utilize the on site spa for a massage, and although it is a very small space, the service was great and it was very peaceful. Overall, there is nothing I can criticize about The James. We loved our stay and will definitely stay there again!"
"Having stayed at the James before, we continue to enjoy the great central location of one block off Michigan in the heart of the miracle mile.Finding the room cramped on previous visits, we obtained a larger room. It was still cramped. With more age personally, we found the chic sofa and wire chairs very uncomfortable. But who, while visiting Chicago sits long in a hotel room. We did like the larger sleeping area.The Hotel has more of a younger clientele, but we did not feel out of place at all. The services of the hotel were used often and were always great.


Room Tip: Get one on the inside of the square and not one with an outside window.

"I am a repeat guest of The James. I enjoyed my stay enough to book a series of corporate events there the following year. It is a very modern, urban-chic hotel with a hot little bar in the lobby. The Primehouse Restaurant served us well for random lunches as well as for the catered event for my company. The service is wonderful and the front desk staff is courteous and flexible. The location is fabulous- a short walk to Michigan Ave. Highly recommend for adult leisure and corporate events."
"Stayed at The James for 3 nights and found the room to be very comfortable (double deluxe). Very clean, good lighting near beds and seating (but not at entrance to room near closet where I kept my open suitcase and wished there was an overhead light to see what I was rifling through). Very comfortable mattresses and pillows, large bathroom with everything I needed. Although on the 14th floor, there was noise from the city street. I slept through it for the most part but my husband had to pop in ear plugs the last few nights. To be expected, the 14th is still not that high when you are right in the city. We used several of the hotel's amenities - the gym, which was a nice size and very well equipped, the free car service when we went to dinner one night a distance away before going to a show at Second City (hysterical, recommend seeing one), and room service when we were too tired to go back out for dinner one night (the food was excellent although I only had soup, salad, and a fruit salad - every last bit of fruit in the salad was perfectly ripe). We also had breakfast in the dining room one morning, enjoyed our meals much more there then the two popular breakfast places we had to line up and wait to get in. The food was really fresh and the coffee is fantastic, it is the same coffee they have at the front desk in the morning. A big kudos to the staff, every last person we spoke with was friendly and helpful. If you are a walker, the location of the hotel is great. We walked to Navy Pier, the Hancock Tower and the beach nearby, Millennium and Grant Park, and the train station (red line) that we took to Wrigley Field; the station is about 3 blocks away from the hotel. If the line for a train pass is too long, there is a Jewel Osco right around the corner that sells train tix at their Service Desk. Great restaurants right around the area (we loved The Purple Pig). Trader Joe's was great for quick snacks to fuel up, right across the street. I would definitely stay at The James again, no complaints!"
This is the first hotel I have been to in years that has no movies. And it uses satellite TV with poor reception. It was a rainy chicago afternoon so I figured I would settle into a movie. Nothing. Doesn't exist. Other than that there is very little storage for clothes. They do have the best in room bar I have ever seen with premium liquors. Ron was kind of small but adequate. King bed was very comfortable. Room.was very clean and personnel courteous.
"The hotel simply had fewer amenities than I had hoped. To be fair, the bed was very comfortable, and the staff was excellent and attentive, but the simple fact that the rooms were older and slightly shabbier than the rooms of peer hotels, and included fewer built in luxuries, was enough to make me feel less pampered than I would have liked. In fairness, the room was very hip and very clean, and the bed was extremely comfortable. In a typical hotel that I was expecting to simply crash in, with no expectations of luxury, I would have been more than satisfied. Its just that the billing of the hotel put me in mind of a more luxurious setting."
"I've stayed here twice and had a great time on both occasions. The rooms are clean and comfortable. My wife appreciated the high quality bath products. The staff is excellent. They are all very friendly, helpful and professional.The hotel is in a great location for playing around the city. They offer bikes to use for free, which we took advantage of and rode over to the beautiful lake shore path."
"The James hotel is very centrally located for seeing Chicago attractions and restaurants. Being close to Eataly and a Whole Foods was very convenient as we were travelling with two picky eaters. The hotel staff were fabulous and the rooms were pleasant and spotless. The hotel gave our children very thoughtful loot bags with a beautiful colouring book, wooden aeroplane, crayons, and a cookbook. This is a charming hotel."

"Great value, great design, great location. Linens are crisp and clean, beds are super comfortable. Can't beat it for it's location regardless of why you are visiting Chi town. Service was great from doorman to concierge. Rooms aren't huge but still feel comfortable. Repeat - great value for a boutique hotel.


Room Tip: Upper floors, a bit of street noise if your sleeping in.

"This is now my third stay (and third review) of the James. First the good: as usual, spectacular customer service, right in the heart of shopping and dining (Trader Joe's and Starbucks right across the street!), and a very clean, contemporary and sophisticated boutique property. There have been a few renovations since I stayed here last and the room refresh looks great. This is the first time I've used the concierge, wonderfully knowledgeable and was able to get us a shorter wait in line at the Grand Lux Cafe in the next block. Now, the not-so-good: we stayed in a Studio Loft Suite on the 17th floor. The heating/cooling system is situated in the room such that the cold air blows directly on you when you are in bed. Brrrrrr!!! In order to keep from freezing, we had to put the unit on ""auto"" which meant that the room kept alternating from muggy to cold and every time the unit kicked on, it would wake us up and it runs loud. Did not make for good sleeping--which is too bad because the bed is very comfortable. Also, in addition to the two televisions, there is also a projection television. It seemed to be malfunctioning because when we tried to turn it off via remote control it kept going into ""stand-by"" mode and turning itself back on after about 3 minutes. I eventually had to climb up and turn off by using the power button on the projection unit itself. And finally, the ""it-would-have-been-nice"": although I received the extra ""perk"" of ""turn-down service"" along with chocolates (!) the previous two times I've stayed here. . .we didn't experience that on this stay. I don't know if it's been discontinued. . .and the lack of it certainly didn't ruin our stay, but I wanted to mention it because other reviewers had. I also thought we might have received a little ""perk"" when we mentioned it was our wedding anniversary (on a previous stay, I received cupcakes for my birthday), but we did not. It was those ""little"" touches on my previous stays that seemed to be missing this time.Overall, our stay was nice (except for the sleeping), but my previous two stays were a bit better. I do intend to stay here again!

"Just returned from a night at The James in Chicago. We'll never stay anywhere else. Perfect location. From the moment we stepped out of our car, the staff graciously took care of us. Front desk quickly called the restaurant and we had our table for two. Spacious room, nice bathroom with lots of amenities, complimentary WiFi, spotlessly clean, comfy bed with lots of pillows. It was such a wonderful experience!"
"First time in Chicago & definitely got the hotel right. The James has a great location just off Michigan Avenue in the heart of the Magnificent Mile - walking distance to lots of shopping, great restaurants & many attractions. Staff was terrific & helpful. If they sensed we had a question or were wondering about something, they would politely ask or offer to help out. The room (king suite) was very contemporary and very clean. Highly recommend it!"
"Upon arrival I was a bit nervous of the hotel staff being snobby, given the location, but no they were so receiving and answered all my questions with a smile. I valeted at 60 dollars for 24 hour in and out privileges which isn't bad since it is mega expensive to park downtown. Walking into the room was like walking into the mad men set, well the hotel in general. It's like a little home away from home. The bed was insanely comfortable just sinks in when you lay down. They include a little bar area and sink for all of your mixing needs. The room was better than any hotel I have ever stayed. Way to go James!"
"I stayed at the James Hotel in Chicago over Memorial Day in 2014 and the hotel and service were beyond amazing.Firstly the hotel is in great shape and they even upgraded us to a loft room which was very large and great amenities including a wall projector! The gym was great and had all the equipment you would need.Secondly and more importantly the staff was super helpful. They catered to every request and the concierge service helped me plan an amazing weekend in the Windy City. Special kudos goes out to Laurelin Hefter, who took great care in ensuring our weekend went off without any problems. She even checked in on her day off.I would recommend the James to anyone looking to visit the city and call ahead and discuss your travel plans with the concierge as they gave great advice on where to eat and drink.


Room Tip: All rooms are great here. But ask for a room with a view.

"The hotel had problems with needing repairs on 2 rooms and were over booked. They called us 1 day before we arrived and offered to put us at the Palomar for 1 night free, gave us a 75$ credit. and paid our cab fair to and from the Palomar. We had a wonderful stay at both hotels but much prefered The James Hotel. They have wonderful comfortable beds and pillows, and wonderful and friendly staff. The adjoining steak house has excellent food and service. Traders Joes and a bakery are across the street."
"This was my second stay at The James, and I loved every moment. This hotel is a gem among luxury boutiques in the Magnificent mile area. However, the employees are the true stars. Well, there may be just one that is a bad apple but whatever... The service is top notch and a great value. I always feel like royalty when I stay. The staff at David Burke's in Chicago is even more friendly than those at the New York location. There are no words for the food, except WOW, and YUM! I highly recommend that you try a hotel suite instead of just a room. Also, dine in the restaurant instead of ordering room service. I am still smiling..."
"Great staff, great service, and perfect location! The hotel was very modern looking, neat, and clean with speedy elevators. The room itself was just as neat and clean and bright. The room is, as others have said, minimalist in nature. I don't mean that as a bad thing either. You have everything you need but not a lot more. The bed was very comfortable and the linens were fabulous! The bathroom was very nice and the bath towels were awesome! They were huge - almost 6 ft long! No wimpy towels here. The location of the hotel was perfect for everything that we had planned. Couldn't have picked a better location to stay. The only thing that I would say as a Con would be the exorbitant parking fee! Use SpotHero and you can park across the street for about1/3 the cost of parking at the hotel. Would definitely stay here again."
"My reviews are very straightforward.....pro's versus con's drive the ranking:
PRO's
--daily glass bottle of water
--provide Intelligent Nutrient Harmonic soaps & shampoos (no harsh chemicals - gluten free)
--minimalist low impact interior designs (some consider this stark...I consider it providing basic human needs)
--full bottles of alcohol in rooms (top shelf brands)
--Starbucks Via instant coffee.....substantially better than grinds...

"We thoroughly enjoyed our few nights at The James. The location really can't be beat and is close to shopping, restaurants, the ""L"" but not so close that it is noisy. The room was exceedingly comfortable and quiet. Very well equipped bar in the room. Everyone was very friendly. Also really enjoyed having a 2pm checkout. Everything was perfect for us and will stay again next time we are in Chicago."
"We were upgraded- great. The room was kind of different, fairly modern and nice. My guess is that the upgrade was for an extra sofa couch bed?? on the other side of the room, which would have been fine had there been three of us, but that was not the case. They had three TV's in the room and they were being upgraded to HD as we were checking out, which would help as the image on the one in our room was marginal at best. The bathrooms were updated and very nice.A nice hotel for non-business occasions, strategically located 1/2 block off Michigan Ave. The minibar was wells stocked and reasonably priced.Air conditioner was noisy, and this was the only negative we experienced. Would definitely recommend."
"I've stayed at the James twice in the last year, really hoping to like this hotel. But each time, I've been disappointed by the rooms and service. It's not that the James is a poor choice in Chicago, it's just that I've had so many better experiences in the city at hotels that often cost half as much.On a recent stay, I ""upgraded"" to a Queen suite. When I arrived in the suite, I found a single room the size of an average hotel room. In fact, the suite was smaller than the regular room at the James I stayed in on a previous visit. Yes, there were two televisions (the one in the sleeping ""nook"" did not work). The room didn't even have a desk, which I needed to get some work done. The mini fridge was warm when I went to grab a soda. And though the decor is cool, the furniture and carpet is a bit tatty and worn.The location of this hotel is excellent. It is in the heart of the city. No complaints there at all. The service is generally good as well, though when I checked out and explained my disappointment with the size of the ""suite,"" the broken television and warm fridge, the desk clerk patronizingly explained that it is a boutique hotel and I shouldn't expect a large room. Thanks a lot.The bottom line is this: There are many fine hotels in Chicago. Competition is fierce for your hotel dollar in this city. It's not enough to be ""pretty good"" -- which is where the James falls, in my opinion. I've tried it twice and won't return. I get much better service and much better accommodations at other hotels in Chicago. And if you book here, don't bother with a suite. It certainly isn't worth the extra money.

I like this hotel-hip and the furnishings are fun and very comfortable. The robe and slippers are a nice touch. My TV in the bed area did not work-I called the desk and the next day they had it fixed-nice customer service. The location is great also. The only downside is the noise in the rooms. They have these vents for the temperature control that are unbelievably loud-it was almost deafening. I had the option of being hot all night or having this thunderous roar of the vent right by my bed. Not restful. It might just be the room I was in-stay away from 1021 suite. Great suit set up but you won't have a restful sleep. Nice staff!
"The staff rocks. from the bellmen to the maintenance engineers to the GM, everyone was very welcoming and genuine. The one bedroom suites are gorgeous. Ours had a north and west view. it was super modern, AWESOME bed and VERY clean. A special thanks to Meg who made our every need come true. We booked several rooms and not a single issue with anyone. David Burke's is attached to the hotel. If you have the time, DO IT.

"Last week, my wife and I spend four nights at The James and we had a great time. The hotel is located in a very good spot, very close to the ""Magnificent Mile"" and not far from the loop. The room was very clean and neat. What I liked the most was the service. The whole staff was very helpful, effective and trully friedly. Lucas (doorman) an Laurelin (concirge) are good examples of that. The hotel also offers four good bikes that can be used by guests 4hours a day free of charge, what I found out to be a good option to explore the areas close to the lake (from Lincoln Park to tre Planetarium)."
"My wife and I stayed here this weekend in celebration of our one year anniversary. They took such wonderful care of us and made our experience just as good as our wedding day. They make you feel like family which is the best way you can treat someone. Unless you don't like your family or they don't like you, in which case they treat you better than family. In all seriousness this Hotel and it's staff are wonderful and kind and considerate. The concierge even took the time to go out and buy flowers and arrange them (beautifully I might add) to have them in our room. That's service and that's what you'll get at the James."
"My husband and I drove from Toronto to Chicago for the Easter long weekend. After a long drive arriving at the hotel was such a relief. We loved our clean, spacious room. If we come back to Chicago we are definitely staying here. You don't feel cheated spending your money staying at this hotel. Parking downtown Chicago is extremely expensive so, we looked online and found Spothero as our solution. Definitely use spothero it'll save you a lot of $$s."
"I can't say enough about this hotel. To begin with it was wonderful. The room was huge (a suite) with a comfortable bed dressed with crisp white linens and plenty of pillows. The bathroom was gigantic and super clean. The whole place was super clean. Two flat screen TVs was great as well. There is a terrific lobby bar called Jimmy's that was crowded and happening at all times of day and night. The bartenders were professional and friendly and knew how to make a drink. Very important!!! We always book a hotel with a lobby bar and this lobby bar was one of the best. The hotel is located on Rush and Ontario which is right in the middle of everything. It was easy to get around Chicago because of the location, public transportation and feet that like to walk. We will definitely stay here again. And the price was VERY reasonable. Less than $300 a night for a larger corner room with plenty of windows on an upper floor with great views.


Room Tip: Corner suite was bright with great views.

"From the moment we arrived at the hotel we were made to feel welcome. Check in was efficient and friendly and within 30 mins of arriving a bottle of wine and chocolates arrived for our anniversary.The location is excellent, two minutes from the Magnificent Mile and an easy walking distance to Navy Pier and theatres.The concierge desk was most helpful with directions and and some great restaurant recommendations.The doormen were also extremely courteous and friendly.Breakfast was also taken at the hotel with plenty of choice from granola through to full breakfast. Again friendly helpful staff.Rooms are comfy lovely lights on dimmer switches , huge comfy beds and a well equiped bathroom with plenty of towels.Rooms also have huge tv, safe, hairdryer and iron.Free use of wifi and hotel computers to print boarding passes.Pre check in requests can be made via the hotel website on arrival day. We asked for high floor quiet room and got a room on top floor away from the elevator.All in all a great place to stay in the city - highly recommended."
"Stayed for three nights and enjoyed the excellent amenities, including use of the ""house car"", turndown service, and bottle of water delivered daily. The rooms were average size and the bed was very comfortable. All of the staff we encountered were very friendly and helpful. The location is great for accessing Michigan Avenue and was an easy walk to the El. The only down side was the noise from the street, even on the 10th floor. Blaring horns and sirens all night. But, I think that is more about the city itself than the hotel. Perhaps the folk who are in charge should consider an passing an ordinance similar to NYC, where cab drivers are fined for using their horn.Bring you earplugs and enjoy your stay. I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone staying in Chicago.


Room Tip: Higher up will hopefully reduce noise.

"My wife and I were given a stay at the James as a gift from my sister and Brother In-Law around the holidays to celebrate our wedding. They picked the perfect location. The staff was extremely friendly and helpful and always greeted us with a smile. When we asked directions to various locations (since this was both of our first times in Chicago), the made sure they gave us step-by-step directions so we would not get lost. Our room upgrade to a King Studio was amazing! The room was the perfect size and was extremely clean and well kept. I had worked with Laurelin, one of the nicest people from concierge, and she assisted me in planning a rose petal turn down service in the best way possible. Whenever I called the front desk or concierge, I was greeted by name and I could tell that the person on the end of the line was smiling. We had Spa treatments at the hotel as well and they left my wife and I in a state of complete and utter relaxation. This was a fantastic hotel and I look for to staying there again in the future!


Room Tip: Make sure you choose a room that will be big enough to your liking. The King Studio was great!

"We lucked into this hotel via Hotwire for 5 days in April. The rooms are decent size and fairly modern looking. The lobby, restaurant and bar are warm and welcoming. The staff was friendly -- Lucas in particular seems like he works 18 hour days for as often as helped us. We would definitely stay there again at the Hotwire price but probably not at the published rate.Only complaints would be the beds were not very comfortable as we both felt the mattresses were too soft. Also, there are no ice machines, you have to call for ice. The hotel guide indicated there was a nightly turndown service that provided ice but we never had that so we often had to call for it. I didn't bother calling about the refrigerators but there were two in the room and neither was working. One was stocked with drinks for the cash bar and the other was empty. Again, we didn't plan on using them so it wasn't an issue for us. I'm sure if we would have called it wouldn't have been dealt with.The location is perfect, just a block away from Michigan ave, and a few blocks north of the river. Plenty of things to do nearby, plus buses and a train station a short walk away.The rooms have a radio with an ipod connection and can play some ""white noise"" like rain, wind, ocean, etc.


Room Tip: It didn't appear there were rooms right by the elevator. The rooms all appear to have street vi...

I have stayed at 12 different hotels in the Chicago Michigan ave. area and I will tell you this blew away every one of them. From the doorman when I arrived and to the doorman on my exit everyone deserved a pay raise. the hotel itself is amazing so much to look at and yet simple. The art work was amazing the bed was superb and the modern design of the room was perfect. I stayed in my room longer than probably any hotel I have ever stayed in as it was so relaxing. Check inn and check out are at 2;00 pm so I did not need to rush out in the morning :).When making your reservation or if dun threw another party call the hotel and ask for an inside facing room so as to have silence no car noise no sirens that you will find in most hotels in a city. Over all the best ever experience at a hotel out side of Las Vegas.
"Hotel rooms should feel inviting as you walk in. But our room was white. Everything was white. It was a small box room. The bathroom door had to be pushed to the side to open. The shower curtain was terry cloth. The pictures were small. The clothes closet was a pressed board thing pushed in the corner. I could go on, but we were VERY sadly disappointed. It seemed like they were trying to be one of the big guys, but just didn't know how to get it together. AND the valet parking was $60. Perhaps this is normal for Chicago but we were shocked, particularly when they could have offered to tell us that a public parking lot was right around the corner. Just so disappointed."
"I booked a 3-night stay over Easter weekend through Hotwire at a hotel that turned out to be the James. I arrived early on Saturday to be warmly welcomed by the doorman and the front-desk staff. I was happy to find out that a room was ready for early check-in, but somewhat less thrilled to find that it was a room with two double beds instead of one king bed, and that it was on the third floor. The very nice girl who checked me in assured me that if I didn't like the room, I could always request a change. She also did a great job in telling me about all the hotel amenities.My third floor room, as feared, did indeed have a pretty awful view of some HVAC equipment and an alley full of dumpsters. However, the positive thing about facing the alley was the lack of street noise. Had I gotten a third-floor room facing the street, it would have been less peaceful. I kept my blinds drawn most of the time to block the inauspicious view, but otherwise, the room itself was perfectly fine. I was afraid the minimalist decor would feel too stark and sterile, but it managed to exude a sense of Zen-like tranquility instead. Everything worked well; I esp. liked the lighting with its dimmer switches and the amenities like coffee/tea-making supplies. The beds were super-comfortable and I slept really well all three nights.The bathroom was also well-appointed and clean, though one thing that bothered me was that spare towels were stacked on a low shelf right next to the toilet. That seemed awfully unhygienic. Also, the medicinal smell of the Intelligent Nutrients toiletries took some getting used to at first.While my room was clean overall, the standards of the housekeeping staff didn't quite match the service I found elsewhere in the hotel. First, my room never actually received any evening turndown service, though the hotel touts daily turndown service among its amenities. (I wondered whether lower-floor rooms are less valued and therefore receive more lackadaisical service, because there were other minor issues: my room was missing a safe; there were no slippers to go with the bathrobes; and the body lotion in the bathroom was never replenished when it ran low. To be fair, the only one of these issues I reported was the missing safe, and the staff not only rectified the situation promptly, but they were also as nice and apologetic as could be.Despite the minor issues I encountered, my last impression of the hotel was one of graciousness and efficiency. Upon checking out, when I told the doorman that I needed a cab to the Clark/Lake station, he responded that the complimentary car service was available to take me there, and in no time at all, my luggage and I were whisked into the gleaming SUV.I didn't use the hotel's business center, gym, spa, concierge or dining options, so can't comment on those services. Leafing through the dining menus, I did feel that the dining options were all really meat-centric, and therefore not appealing to me. My favorite breakfast destination in the neighborhood was the lovely, casual Pierrot Gourmet in the Peninsula Hotel.For the low Hotwire rate I paid ($95/night), the James certainly provided excellent value. I do feel, though, that the minor housekeeping issues I encountered keep the James a notch or two below a hotel like the nearby Palomar (whose room decor and Kimpton perks I also prefer), but I'd definitely consider staying at the James again."
"Our stay started badly as the 'deluxe' room we were given was, as the wonderfully helpful Lobby Assistant agreed, in an 'unacceptable' state. The blind in the bathroom was held up by black sticky tape, the cover on the filthy heater was missing as was the cover on the light switch, whose plate was covered in greasy finger marks. There was no proper shower - just one in the bath. The bathroom had a sliding door and the wardrobe was behind a sad curtain. Chips out of the furniture. However, thanks to the Lobby Assistant, the hotel tried very hard to resolve the problem. He showed us every other room they had available and they were certainly in a far better condition. We were given a reduced rate to upgrade to a Loft Room and a credit towards food. The Loft Rooms (which, strangely, are not in the loft but on the tenth floor) are a better bet as they are bigger and have a proper table and chairs for eating/working at. They also have a double bed and a 'media' bed. The latter is for lying on to watch films on a big screen. Alas, projector was missing and we did not see a DVD player. Perhaps you have to ask for these. We weren't fussed and I am sure they would have been provided had we asked for them.I was staying with my son so we asked for the media bed to be made up for him. Indeed it was but with a horrible polyester blanket that gave him electric shocks! This was changed immediately, at my request, the next day. Incidentally, their bedlinen is beautiful, fine Egyptian cotton.The bathroom had the same strange sliding door as the deluxe room but at least it had a proper (and very good) shower. That said, they should provide some instructions on how to use it! My son is an engineer and it took him some time to work it out. I hated the toiletries, as did he. They were supposed to be some organic stuff and were plentiful in the shower but they stung! The hotel is a conversion from some old apartment block and it is not an entire success. The rooms are small and dark. They aim to be uber-cool but are not and are all beginning to look rather tired.However, the staff is very helpful, the position could not be more perfect - just off the 'Magnificent Mile/Michigan Avenue' and the David Burke Primehouse is a fantastic restaurant. Mainly steak, obviously, but a wonderfully wide range of food. Great waiting staff; the wine waiter took infinite care over my two glasses of wine! Food fantastic. The restaurant was full so you need to book in advance."
"The James hotel is a great place to stay while in Chicago. First, the staff at the hotel were friendly and great. The rooms were clean and the bed very comfortable. The hotel is very well located to many of the tourist sites. There are lots of restaurants and shopping near the hotel. Laurelin Hefter at the Concierge was most help in arranging tours for us. Other concierge staff also provided us tips and guidance to many of our questions. Thanks to The James for a wonderful weekend."
"We stayed here for a mother daughter getaway with some school friends. I chose this hotel as it had a great location, and offered great value for money. We took the train in, which was a short cab ride from the station. The doorman greeted us with a warm welcome. We did get both rooms on the same floor, which was a bonus. Beds were very comfortable and the extra amenities such as a mini bar, snacks, shampoo, bathroom and writing desk was a bonus. Concierge desk was helpful (Laura Lynn?). The best of all is that they had a car service ,if available, will take you to where you want to go downtown. We used it twice an Audi Q7, NICE. EJ was such a gentleman and good driver :) I would stay again as well as recommend it to my clients.

"I'm so glad we booked this hotel for our weekend! Upon arrival I was immediately pleased with our choice. Alex at the desk checked us in and we were upgraded to a studio room, (I booked through expedia). He was very friendly and knowledgable about the hotel. In fact every member of the staff we encountered was not only helpful but also genuinely friendly. Anyone can be polite, but everyone we interacted with seemed like they really did enjoy their job and were more than happy to help.Our room was lovely, intelligently designed and a great use of space throughout. The bed was really very comfortable and though we didn't take advantage of this perk, there was a note in the room that offered a few different types of pillows that you could try. I slept so well, and that is rare for me when I'm traveling. The bathroom is a good size and I personally really appreciated the lit magnified mirror. The tub was not so comfortable for soaking but that's ok. The shower head provided a nice soak and the water pressure was pretty good. I really liked that this hotel uses full size communal shampoo, conditioner and body wash; so much less waste and if you are staying for multiple days it means you don't have to bring those items with you. I didn't get a chance to use the hotel's spa, but in the brochure they offered a wide range of services. If our trip had been longer I would have loved a massage.I really liked the gym as well, they had a variety of equipment and everything was clean and well organized. I had a good workout and it was a good way to start the day.As we were leaving, one of the guys at the door was nice enough to give us a ride to the train station in the hotel's car service. I wish I could remember his name because he was super nice and friendly, plus he saved us a cab ride. I kind of forgot that the hotel offered this service; we will definitely take advantage of it more next time. Which brings me to my next point: We will absolutely stay here again, repeatedly, and so should you."
"Every time I've stayed at The James, I've been blown away. The location is perfect/close to everything and the rooms are lovely, with amazing bath products. But what REALLY keeps me coming back are the people that work there. I've never had a bad encounter with ANYONE. Especially the gentlemen at the door....SO professional and courteous. They greet me and make me feel like a queen every single time, whether I'm dressed up or look like I've just rolled off a truck somewhere. It's the nicest feeling in the world. The front desk is just as wonderful...everyone stops to greet me when I walk past and anything I need is always immediately taken care of. I have no idea how they do it with such remarkable consistency!! I won't stay anywhere else in Chicago."
"I stayed here at the beginning and end of a 4,000 mile road trip around the Midwest and Northwest in May 2014.It's a lovely hotel, well located within walking distance of Millennium Park and the awesome AIC. Staff were pleasant and helpful, the rooms were clean and well appointed. On the second visit I booked a riverfront room, which had a great window-snug overlooking the river. Definitely worth the additional cost. I'd be tempted to use the same hotel when I return to Chicago, which isn't something I usually do.


Room Tip: River view rooms are worth the extra - the window snugs are very nice!

"Each member of the staff I encountered provided exceptional hospitality, from the welcome I received at the front desk, the attentive restaurant service, the enthusiastic doorman, the pleasant wine hostess, zipping out at checkout even with some incidentals, and even a follow up from the manager. Great location, comfortable room, but it was the service that set this trip apart.

"We just left the Monaco hotel and were a bit unimpressed with our visit. All the staff that we encountered were extremely friendly and very helpful, especially the hotel Porters.Although our room was clean, it was nothing to write home about. Upon entering the room and inspecting the mini-fridge, there was a can of sprite missing already. Next, the toilet in the bathroom was not very secured to the floor and therefore it wobbled. We looked outside, not expecting a fantastic view, and were greeted with a rooftop featuring a dead pigeon that had been there for a while. Before we could fully unpack our belongings, a man who (we assume?) worked there knocked on our door and asked if he could come in and take a picture of the office chair. As he pulled out his smart phone and took a picture of the chair, he stated that they were in the process of updating some of the furniture in rooms. He then also peaked at the soap dish in the bathroom before leaving. This made us extremely uncomfortable. The next morning, at 8:45am, we were woke up to someone knocking on the door saying ""housekeeping"". I opened the door and the lady apologized and stated that she could come back later. At 10:30am, someone else came to the door and knocked from housekeeping. I opened the door again, slightly frustrated and a different lady apologized and stated that she could come back later. I told her to come back at noon when we had checked out. Upon leaving, one of the Porters held our bags so that we could enjoy the city without being weighed down. When we came back, the other Porter remembered us, asked how our night in the city was, opened the door for us, grabbed our bags and then asked if he could call a cab for us. Exceptional service.Overall, our stay was okay. I was glad that our room was clean and the staff was friendly, but all other aspects of our visit were sub par."
"I am a Kimpton fan. They find a grand (and often older) property and turn an interior design firm loose to enhance the original architecture and designs with new energy and flare. In the Monaco group this means that the feel is traditional, elegant but bright and fun. At Hotel Monaco Chicago, the location just off of North Michigan and in view of the river makes it an ideal location for walking and exploring; the park, the museum, food and of course the blues. For this visit, I used Karma points earned over the last year and was treated on arrival to an upgrade to a beautiful suite. The staff, as usual was ready at every contact to see what I might need. The restaurant was great at breakfast and for afternoon coffee.So, the Kimptons always make traveling a pleasure and this Chicago location gets it all right.

"Very nice location for Michigan Ave, Loop, or River North destinations. Walkable to Millenium Park and Art Institute- when its not too cold!. Nice rooms- we went for the goldfish companion for fun. Restaurant is fair but solid for bar drinks (very good bartender) and breakfast. Had to stay an extra night due to an ice storm in home city and was accommodated seamlessly. Wine and hot cider (spiked and non) happy hour. As with all Kimptons- a boutique fun feel that benefits from the chain's good taste and standards is without unwanted surprises. Next to the Virgin Hotel and seems a much hipper and lively property.Fine for couples, families and small pets.

"Love this hotel. Third time to stay there and I always enjoy it. I was in Chicago for a conference, but instead of staying at the conference hotel, I walked daily in the snow and cold weather to stay at the Monaco. That is how much I enjoy the hotel. Great people - friendly service - excellent location. I will definintely be back.

"Try to get a room above the 9th floor because its on a busy street also ask for a river view. Our room was so sweet it had two window seats the one was 6ft x 4ft the other was smaller but both with cushions and pillows. Friendly Staff and they worked with us on everything. Warning not every floor has a ice machine so when you leave your room take your ice bag so you can stop and get ice on your return and not have to go to the room to get your bag then to another floor.

"Just returned home from the BigTen tournament in Chicago. A friend had booked his room here,so I did as well.Very classy,boutique feel hotel. Smaller, but just right. Staff were very friendly. Room was awesome! Only suggestion would be to have a few bottles of water in the room,as there is no ice or beverages. The parking is a shock at $58 a day,but I understand that's the norm. Would definitely come back. Great location also. Will look for Kimpton hotels in the future."
"We stayed in a Riverview Mediterranean suite, not much expense to upgrade, but definitely worth the money. We had corner room with amazing views of the river on both walls. Better yet, we had so much room to spread out and sleep.There are extremely comfortable window seats that are the size of twin mattresses in the main bedroom and half the width in the sitting room. Easily, you could sleep 10-12 people. That brings me to the only downside... the bathroom. It felt very dated, with chips of fiberglass tub exposed. (Granted, it was the world's deepest tub-- almost like a swimming pool). However, the space would be better served with a more generous shower. This one was big enough for me, but feels like an RV shower size. Some cracks in the grout, but nothing that would stop me from booking again.Back to the positives... the service was exceptional, the room phenomenally clean, and noise was not excessive (street noise can be heard, but it's not worse than any other big city hotel). The staff even made up beds with a quick phone call. While you may expect housekeeping to do this automatically, you definitely don't expect them to set up beds in the window seats and have your kiddo's favorite stuffed animal waiting for them. VERY great job.The location was easily walkable to many main areas. A black Uber car service was $15 to John Hancock building/Water Tower theater.


Room Tip: Splurge for the Riverside Mediterranean suite... definitely worth it.

"I have to start by saying I am a huge Kimpton (and Hotel Monaco) fan. I try to stay at Kimpton's as much as possible when traveling and appreciate their unique, boutique style and great customer service.The Hotel Monaco in Chicago is very centrally located. I was there for an entire week on business, traveling solo and found it to be easy for me to walk to most places or quickly get a cab when necessary. The decor was very true to Monaco style - although maybe not quite as eclectic as other versions in Seattle or Portland. My room had a nice view and adorable window seat and was a nice size. I think my only complaint was that room service was...basically only edible at best. I got room service dinner I believe my first night there as I had arrived pretty late and it was really not good. Otherwise - great place to stay when traveling to Chicago! Also great rates!"
"I can't say enough about how much I love both the hotel itself and the staff at Hotel Monaco Chicago. The actual physical hotel is beautiful and the window seats in the rooms are a hit with the kids and the adults. I have had interaction with the manager, the desk staff and the concierge and I just can't express how pleasant and helpful they are. The doorman and the concierge really make my daughter feel special when we stay here, they are so sweet and really engage her in conversation. We visited the Monaco before school started after a difficult summer that included accident and injuries, I let the hotel know this was a special trip for us and they were so nice. Sent up a welcome basket and a card, love the people that work in this hotel!! We will be spending Easter with you this year.

"We stayed for a girls weekend. We contacted the concierge, Sheila Garg, before our trip and she was unbelievably helpful. She welcomed us upon arrival, added even more restaurant and site seeing options, and even sent a little treat up to our room. The front desk was very attentive and friendly. The evening happy hour is a nice little touch.This hotel is in a great location, steps from a Starbucks and an Irish Pub across the street.We were able to walk to great shopping and the Chicago Institute of Arts. Great stay!

"I have stayed at this lovely hotel many times and always found it to be a pleasure. The rooms are beautiful and well appointed. The meeting rooms and gym are great. But the customer service keeps me coming back. All the staff are friendly, personable and professional. And then there are the charming quirky touches like the goldfish! If you are looking for a place to stay with great access to Michigan Ave shopping, museums and Millenium Park this is a perfect location and you are a block and a half from the CTA Orange Line to travel other places in the city."
"The hotel is older and charming. The attached restaurant is great for Brunch, Lunch and Dinner. The Bar is lively.I liked this hotel for many reasons. It is a great bargain given the location and style of the hotel. Our room was plenty large and the bathroom were spacious as well. Many wonderful things to do in this great city.


Room Tip: I believe we got a junior suite which was plenty large including the bathrooms.

"We picked this hotel because it was a few minutes walk to the Chicago Theater for the Louis CK show and had some really nice restaurants nearby. The people at check-in were extra friendly and our room was larger than we expected. We had 6 PM dinner reservations so the early evening complimentary wine bar was a pleasant surprise and we enjoyed sipping wine in front of the lobby fireplace for 30 minutes before heading out into the frigid January Chicago weather for dinner. Besides the excellent coffee in the lobby be sure to try the cucumber flavored water. The hotel Wi-Fi was around $12.00 but it looked like if you joined their ""club"" with your email address it was free. We were not there long enough to bother with it."
Let me start by saying how picky I can be about hotels. This hotel is spectacular!! Location location location!! It is right in the heart of downtown close to everything including michigan ave for shopping! Now the more important stuff. I must say I have never stayed at a hotel where everyone went above and beyond to make you fee welcome and right at home. From Erika at the front desk to I believe it was Sierra at concierge to the most amazing two doormen in the lobby Antonio and Michael. I truly can't mention enough how amazing these two are. Very helpful in helping you find anything from a restaurant to parking lots that are close and below average!! They stand out in this cold but their personalities and politeness warm you up like the cups of hot chocolate the hotel provides. I honesty am coming back to this hotel for the people that work here. An amazing hotel and on top of all that amazing service the rooms are huge. They are very clean and housekeeping deserves the credit. Can't wait to come back with my lady and that's the truth. Wish the Kimpton hotel Monaco a great and prosperous 2015!!!! FK
Me and my wife spent Christmas and new years at this hotel. The hotel itself is really nice and all the staff working here are very helpful the hotel is in a great location. The rooms are spacious and the Riverview rooms which we had have great views. The wine Club is A nice touch and a great place to meet other people. If we visit Chicago again this hotel will definitely be our first choice as we could not fault this hotel for service location and friendliness.
"Had a ""staycation"" at the Hotel Monaco Chicago over the holidays and it was a dream! My almost four year old niece was in from out of town for Christmas and my mother, niece, and I planned a fun ""girl's only trip"" in the city to get out of the suburbs. We checked in and the hotel staff was wonderful and very accommodating - they even had a small bag for her at check-in with golfish crackers, a toy golfish, and My Little Pony stickers. We requested a real goldfish be sent to the room and it was brought up immediately, which she loved.The window seats were great - honestly, we could have stayed in the room the whole time and she would have been excited just to hang out in the window seats! I highly suggest booking one of the suites that over looks the river - gorgeous view of the city.After dinner, and before we went out to see Cinderella on Broadway, we got back to the room and the hotel staff had left her some more fun gifts! One of the little presents was a crown and ""jewels"" that she wore to the play. We ordered room service for breakfast the next day and it was delivered at the exact time we requested - allowed us to relax a little longer in the morning before starting our day and getting everything packed up.The hotel did a wonderful job making her feel like a ""princess"" (which, as an almost four year old, is her latest obsession) and enhanced our Chicago experience. Thank you to the staff for creating great memories we were able to share with her, and making traveling with a toddler very relaxing and fun!

"Stayed at the Hotel Monaco on NYE. Hotel is a typical Kimpton decor, with friendly staff, good sized rooms and comfortable beds and pillows. Front door service and valet were very attentive, and while pricey is par for the course in Chicago. A great location in the middle of the city. Would definitely stay at this hotel again. Make sure that you go to the restaurant that is connected to the hotel - South Water Kitchen - and ask for Dan to make you a drink. He, and his drinks, are amazing. We ordered some apps and had a few drinks which were great - would be interested in having dinner there during our next trip."
"Just stayed at the Monaco Hotel in Chicago for 2 nights for a Mom/Daughter shopping, touring, eating, and entertainment few days. We upgraded to the top floor with a ""river view"". It was totally worth it. Sitting in the window seats looking out over the river was amazing. We loved our oversized room with the animal print robes. The wine hour in the evening, the Hot Cocoa during the day and coffee and tea in the morning were just a few a the reasons we love Kimpton Hotels. The staff is very attentive, from the doorman, to the front desk person. The concierge also helped us ahead of time to set up a few dinner reservations."
"We arrived at the hotel after 2 flight changes and 2 flight delays and no baggage ! the concierge Sheila was absolutely brilliant in dealing with the airline and transport company to get our baggage ( it arrived 3 days later ), she also is a wealth of knowledge about Chicago- the best places to eat and drink ( try the ribs at Carsons ), a good place to catch a beer or two with very large food portions is the Emerald loop across the road ! make sure you ask Sheila about riding the 'L' system !"
"The Hotel Monaco is centrally located near the theater district, near Michigan Avenue shopping, and not far from the Art Institute. The Mediterranean Suite that we chose in the Chicago Wabash Street location are extremely comfortable and very well decorated. We had previously stayed at a Kimpton property in San Francisco across from Fisherman's Wharf called the Argonaut located at...

"My wife and I stayed at the Hotel Monaco for four nights in September and we had a superb experience. We paid about $205.00, a corporate rate I got through my employer. The location is superb, at the top of the loop just across the river from Near North (I think there are river view rooms, but we did not have one). It is close to Millennium Park, the Art Institute, the downtown business district, and the Magnificent Mile.The rooms are large and stylish. Housekeeping is impeccable. Beds are very comfortable, and our room was quiet.Staff was very friendly and helpful. I left my car keys in the room. I rushed back, and the staff found my keys and returned them to me in time for my flight.The restaurant was tasty and stylish. Service was attentive. The prices were a little on the high side, but reasonable given the location and the fact that it is a hotel restaurant.The Monaco, like all Kimpton Hotels, offer some nice freebies: a wine hour, a $10.00 ""raid the mini-bar credit"", bottled water, coffee in the lobby in the mornings, etc. These nice touches can add up to a significant savings.If I could, I would rate this hotel 4 and 1/2 stars. Why not 5? A couple of very minor complaints. First, the gym, like that in all Kimpton hotels, is a little modest. This chain caters to an upscale crowd which values fitness; I am not sure why they have not caught up to marketplace in this regard. Second, the cold pizza offered at the wine hour was a turnoff. Either keep it hot, offer nuts or something else, or nothing at all. I did enjoy the free glass of wine each night before dinner.A final comment: the size of this hotel is idea in my opinion. It is large enough to offer plenty of services and amenities, but not so large that you feel lost in the crowd. I highly recommend this place.


Room Tip: I would ask for a higher floor.

"I stayed at the Hotel Monaco while visiting The Loop on business. Great Kimpton property in a central downtown location between The Loop and Magnificent Mile. Great value compared to similar hotels in the area.My 14th floor room was modern and clean. It was comparable in size to the rooms I've stayed in at other downtown hotels. I especially enjoyed the window seat, which is a small bed in the window nook that provides a nice view of the city. My only complaint was that the television reception was not very good (same problem that I've encountered at other downtown hotels). Overall, I was very pleased with my stay. I will likely return to the Monaco the next time that I visit the area."
"I just love this property. I head to Chicago a few times a year and this time decided to introduce a group of friends to the fantastic line of Kimpton hotels. I brough three girls with me for a weekend to see Garth Brooks at the Staples Center. We checked in and were upgraded to a larger room. Got to love Kimpton In-Touch Rewards. The room was LARGE. There were two very big window seats/beds. One of the girls made this her bed and slept there all night. It was super comfortable. These rooms are large enough for 5-6 people. We checked in and were told that we had a special treat on its way up to us later. We did some shopping and walking around and came back to the wine reception in the lobby, which is always a nice addition to these hotels. We then found the surprise in our room. There were mini bottles of vodka, lemonaide, and glow sticks for our concert with a special note that told us to have a good time at the show. You just can't find personalized service like this anywhere else. The Monaco is in a great location for everything, right near Michigan ave. A short walk to the park or to all of the shopping you could want in either direction.Overall, our stay was wonderful. Can't wait to come back!"
"Stayed with them one night on their local rate. The room was fine - everything was actually kind of old and run down. The problem came with my credit card. They charged me twice for the room, along with another pending charge of $267; and they also charged my girlfriend for the room. It is now five days later and we have been carrying a charge of appx. $920 on our two credit cards for almost a week for a $215 room total charge. They can wave this off to sloppy front desk work, but I find it incredibly irresponsible. I can't help but think they do this kind of thing on purpose from time to time because they get away with it. I will be avoiding Klimpton hotels and Hotel Monaco chain hotels in the future."
"The Hotel was great...nicely appointed and a very friendly staff... Location could not have been better! Room was very clean and bed was comfy. Parking was convenient. We stayed two nights , ate breakfast in the hotel restaurant. We had a good Time. We were on a slight budget and booked on Hotwire Last minute.

"My wife and I took a trip to Chicago for our anniversary to see friends and to just get away for a few days. Our last night we decided to stay at Hotel Monaco based on location and our past experience with Kimpton Hotels. Upon arrival we were upgraded to river view suite, we dropped our bags off and checked out this huge and beautiful suite we were given and headed out to explore the rest of the afternoon. When we returned we found a chilled bottle of champagne, glasses, and a nice note for our anniversary. We enjoyed the champagne looking out over the city streets from one of our huge and comfortable window seats. I have to say they made us feel very special and Kimpton Hotels will be at the top of the list when we travel."
"The location is really good, close to several good restaurants and stores. Just in front of Trump Tower, a ten minutes walk to Millenium Park and The Art Institute of Chicago, half an hour from Willis Tower, Navy Pier, Shedd Aquarium and Adler Planetarium.They have a good Fitness center, a nice Happy hour and something very important a fair price.I had my room three hours before, which was awesome after 10 hours flight from Brazil. When I'm back to Chicago, I don't need to think about hotel, I'm sure I'll be back to Hotel Monaco."
"What a surprise! As many times as I've walked along Wabash Ave., I had never noticed this hotel. I arrived late--close to midnight and found the staff, bellman and receptionist, expecting me. They immediately made me feel welcomed and as though I was a valued guest. Given the late hour, that was surprising and nice. I was immediately taken with the decor in the lobby area, enough so that I pulled out my camera to snap some pictures. The young woman behind the registration desk stepped out to point out features of interest. Afterwards, the bellman escorted me to my room and explained its features. Before he left, he asked if I needed anything else and reminded me of their names.At that point, though I felt tired, I checked out the room because it was so interesting. First things first. There were plenty of outlets, accessible from the tables and desks, and plenty of lighting. My room did not have a view, but it did have a large flat screen and a well-stocked mini bar with bottled water, named Fred, in the shape of a pint of liquor. It threw me at first, but I finally figured out it was water. But I digress. The bedside table had an alarm clock with and IPod/IPhone dock. The bathroom was fine, and thankfully had a lighted magnifying mirror. The room also has wild looking bathrobes in animal prints and a yoga mat so you can stretch out after, or before I guess, a long day. The only thing I would change is the tub. If rooms are ever upgraded, I'd probably pull the tub in my room and make the shower a walk-in. The tub was shallow and had no grab bar, so it was impractical from my perspective. However, that is a minor aside. The room was clean, the bed comfy and the hotel quiet. Now that I've discovered it, I will certainly stay there again on visits to Chicago and recommend it to you. BTW, the morning hotel staff were just as warm and friendly as the night staff had been."
"Please read my full review to decide if you will be happy here nor not. First.. Location. First rate. A block from the Trump Tower, the Magnificent Mile, and the EL Loop Station. A short walk to Millenium park, the (former) Sears Tower, and the John Hancock Tower. Frankly, you cannot get a better location. We arrived at noon and our room was not yet available. We were given the option of a room on a lower floor, (with feather pillows that housekeeping would change to foam pillows) or waiting for our assigned room. We opted to wait. The ""happy"" bellman put our bags in storage. An hour later we returned and learned that our room was ready. The ""happy"" bellman retrieved our bags and asked if we wanted him to bring them to our room. We declined, but thanked him for his offer. We arrived in our room (1101) and at first glance, it was gorgeous! Every inch of it was spotless thanks to the impeccable effort of the housekeeping staff. We opened the drapes and foudn a great view of a wall. We also heard the sound of air conditioner compressors but they weren't obstrusive. When we looked out the window, we saw them on, approximately, the fourth floor. So, if your room is in the back, the higher up you are (we were on 11) the less you wil hear the A/C compressors. Now it was time to unpack for our 4 day stay. Adjacent to the bed was a large glass top night table w/o any storage. There was a large desk with numerous power outlets and a bright lamp but no drawers. The large mini bar under the 37 inch TV was well stocked but again, had no storage space. The hair dryer, surprisingly, was a discount house special which would have been fine if the outlet hadn't bee located in a place where the power cord prevented easy use with the bathroom mirror. The only storage space were the 4 small drawers in the night table. The closest had several hangers, but no storage space. This is the only reason that I had to reduce rating from 5 to 4 and, in all honesty, I was tempted to reduce it to 3. In my opinion, hotel rooms need to be useful and functional and that means enought storage space for clothes. Monoco requires you to live out of your suitcase. If you are comfortable with that, then you will love this hotel. But if you are like me, who expect a dresser and an amoire, then you will not be happy with this hotel. The staff had an ""I can do that for you"" attitude"" which I really appreciated and the housekeeping staff was outstanding.. although the hotel doesn't provide turn down service. To sum up, service is outstanding, rooms are excellent except if you need storage space for clothes etc.Location is exceptional. And, the evening complementary wine is appreciated by all. Despite excellent reviews, we were disappointed in the food at the Hotel's restaurant. Except for the excellent Egg White Omlett the rest of the food was mediocre at best. I can't figure out how they ended up with a hard boiled poached egg!


Room Tip: If you are in the back, select a high floor to avoid the A/C compressor noise

"Off to a good start. I arrived early, long before check in. That was fine and I completely understood, the front desk staff had my room ready in 30 minutes which they didn't have to do - but was much appreciated. Rooms were clean and efficient. Nothing over the top, but functional. Location is 1 block south of the river - but in a great location to go anywhere downtown.The staff makes this hotel a positive experience."
"First off I try to stay at Kimpton Hotels in cities I visit and really like them. The Hotel Monaco was superb and no exception. Everyone was so friendly and helpful... they even surprised us with a treat bag filled with candy corn and popcorn... and a room upgrade. The room was decorated in a funky yet fun manner while at the same time very comfortable. The window seats ... more like window beds... are the best! Spent a lot of time just sitting observing the city. Room was very clean. When I travel to Chicago this is now my hotel.


Room Tip: From my experience every room in a Kimpton is good.

"I love Kimpton hotels! They have swanky decor, fun bathrobes (zebra or tiger motif) and extras such as coffee in the AM and a wine hour. This one is centrally located near Magnificent Mile and Millenium Park. We had riverview rooms which I would highly recommend as you can see the twinkling lights from the buildings reflecting on the river.

"We stayed for 3 nights and 2 days at the Hotel Monaco,Chicago in October 2014. It was awesome! We had our Golden Doodle dog ""Juno"" with us and the staff made us all feel welcome and special! Sheila, Rich, Antonio,Liz, David, and Frances really stood out for their customer focus and people skills. The room was clean, nicely decorated, everything worked! The shower had a high ceiling (we are tall and really like that) with great water pressure and lots of hot water! The queen beds were really comfy. Though it was located in the busy downtown Loop area, it was quiet and we slept well. This boutique hotel is perfectly located, beautifully decorated, clean and the staff are really customer focused.They are really pet friendly- they do NOT charge extra for your pet and provide a gift bag,and food and water bowls. Wine hour in the lobby at 5 p.m. every evening is a lovely experience, we got to meet really interesting and friendly fellow guests. We will definitely stay here when we return to Chicago again!! Great value for money and excellent quality!!"
"I didn't spend too much time in my room because I was at a conference - it seemed quiet, comfortable and clean. What really made me a real fan: a fleet of bicycles (free) allowed me to ride to and from the McCormick Center along the Lakeshore bike path. Helmet and lock included. I also appreciated the option of Chicago Tribune, USA Today, NY Times and WSJ at the coffee bar.The wine hour brought many people together in the lobby and encouraged a social atmosphere that was fun. Every single person working there was helpful and friendly. Can't say enough

The Monaco in Chicago lived up to the high expectations I have come to have for Kimpton properties. Our room with 2 queen beds was spacious enough. The staff was attentive and prompt when we needed anything. We also very much enjoyed the evening wine reception in the lobby. On our last day we had a big group brunch at South Water Kitchen. The food was great and they had no problem accommodating our large group.
"Read reviews on TripAdvisor for Hotel Monaco while planning a weekend trip to Chicago. Loved the idea of the fish bowl and wine hour, so I booked a room. I was not dissapointed! The rooms are so cozy and clean. Most comfortable bed. Staff was so genuinely friendly!! Wine hour in their comfy lobby was a great way to relax and meet other guests. It's little added touches like this that makes a hotel stand out! Thank you Hotel Monaco for an amazing stay!"
"Just returned from a week in Chicago. The first half of the week was for work and in a ""work"" hotel. The second half was personal and we spent it at the Monaco.While the first hotel was fine - everything was okay there was nothing of actual note to make you remember the hotel.Then we moved to the Monaco and upon walking in it was a completely different world. The staff was friendly and helpful. The room was insanely cool -- especially the window seat! Never thought I'd be into it but it was nice to be able to sit there (with PLENTY of room for two) and look down at the river and watch Chicago go by for a bit.We went down to the wine hour and when we got back to our room there was a welcome amenity, sent up by Ericka Kouba that had a few local things to share with us since it was our first time in Chicago. Again, the little things that suddenly make the Monaco heads and tails from where we'd been earlier in the week.Throughout the week the various staff members we talked with were friendly, remembered us and always had a minute to talk.The final part that reaffirmed why we are dedicated Kimpton devotees was that the fan in our room went out the afternoon of the last day we were there. Things happen, machines break. We called and within minutes maintenance was in our room and checking it out. It took not time to determine that the fan wasn't going to come back to life -- 4 hours to repair. We were more than happy to hang tight knowing we'd have air soon enough and told management it wasn't an issue. The phone rang 10 minutes later and we were moved to a suite for the last night with apologies for the inconvenience! Talk about taking an unfortunate situation and not only making the best of it but making sure you have clientele that will come back again and again.Thanks to EVERYONE at the Monaco for a very memorable first visit to Chicago, maintenance (who was awesome and did get the a/c back up and running as we talked with him the next morning) and to Ericka Kouba for making sure we have a great visit. (Say Hi to ""Emily"" for me!)

"What a special place! Old world charm meets new world amenities. In looking for an upscaled, downtown Chicago hotel and wanted something convenient to all the major shops, eateries and the lake, I found it all here. My room wasn't available at check-in, so I changed in the hotel restroom, left my luggage with the valet and went for a run along Lake Shore. Upon return, my room was ready. It was clean, tastefully furnished, complete with the fun, eclectic Kimpton touches .. animal print robes, $10 raid the bar credit, etc. A few minutes after settling in, a knock on the door produced a porter who presented me with a bottle of wine and a fruit tray .. as an apology for not having my room ready upon my arrival. Now that's what I call service, considering I checked in before the posted check-in time! At 5 pm, the evening wine hour was met with many interesting guests and servers. Another interesting touch is that the wine steward changes. Could be the valet, the bellman, someone from reception or the back office. I enjoy getting to know the entire Kimpton staff. Speaking of staff .. every member was friendly, accommodating and greeted with a hello .. and how can I help you? The valet was, by far, my favorite, however. Always a friendly smile, an opened door and a ""thank you for staying with us .. how can I assist you?"" (This occurred every time I entered or left.) Made me feel like royalty, even when I came in dripping with sweat from a long run. I would recommend staying here for anyone.The only downside was the downtown noise and something going on in the floor above my room. The odd thing is I was staying on the top floor (and there's no banquet room, etc., above my room), so not sure what that was about?? Sounded like kids running amok in the middle of the night. For the light sleepers, I recommend ear plugs. Otherwise, it was a perfect stay at another Kimpton establishment!

"We had a great time at this hotel. The rooms were VERY clean, and well appointed. I loved the robes, the yoga mat in the room, and the decor was very chic. The high quality hair dryer was awesome, and there was lovely soap and shampoos. The black out curtains were great, and I loved the height of the room, and how gorgeously it was decorated. Our linens were crisp and clean, the pillows and king bed were delightful. The hotel itself was centrally located. We were in town for marathon weekend, and the concierge was helpful with special breakfast options starting at 4am, and directions to the race. The selection of teas and coffees in the lounge in the morning were yummy, and the iced lemon and cucumber waters were a delicious afternoon option. I would stay at the Monaco again in a heartbeat. A+ experience.

"Hotel Monaco is a fantastic hotel; friendly staff, fantastic location great rooms (quiet despite the busy location), good modern gym facilities (loved the hula hoop), and wine time between 5 and 6 is a great idea (although we were only at the hotel during this time when we checked in. Complementary robes in the room were fun too; we had a zebra and cheetah.Only grumble would be that there are no do not disturb signs so the house keeping staff knock on the door in the morning, relatively early, between 8 and 9. We were on our way out each time so it was not a problem for us but if we had wanted to sleep in this would have been a little irritating."
"I booked this hotel from the road on the afternoon before i arrived. My choice was based on tripadvisor ratings and price.Upon arrival, i asked for a ""nice room"" (which i always do), and i got top floor with riverview. I think this is probably one of the best rooms possible. Direct view to Trump Tower and a little reclining area in the window. There was a bottle of champagne (most likely by mistake) in a cooler in the room so i called reception about this. They told me it was mine now... good start for a friday night.I asked for dinner options and got a few good recommendations, within walking distance.Next morning, i had to ship some goods with UPS and the concierge Sheila was extremely helpful and friendly with this.Altogether, i was very pleasantly surprised by the service and friendliness i got for the price, compared to other 4 star hotels in chicago. I will go back anytime and will recommend this hotel to all my friends.

"We stayed at the hotel Monaco 22nd to 27th May and had a wonderful stay.We were there for our honeymoon and they upgraded us to an even nicer room with a lovely view of the river.The hotel was clean and staff friendly. Especially the concierge who wished us a nice day whenever we went out.The hotel was in the best location in downtown, easy to get to from the CTA train traveling from airport and easy to walk to Lincoln park, magnificent mile, beach/lake shore trail and to soldier field, field museum.Would definitely stay again. It was brilliant.

"Our four days at the Hotel Monaco were absolutely perfect. The staff could not have been more helpful and friendly...we were given wonderful advice and recommendations from the concierge. We loved the cocktail hour in the late afternoon with free wine and treats. The location is brilliant with nearly all major sights (Michigan Avenue, Millenium Park, River North, etc.) within walking distance. My favorite aspect of the hotel however was the room. The beds were deliciously comfortable. The window seat was a perfect spot to read and watch boats float down the river. The decor was tasteful and unique. Plus, the goldfish was a great touch. Out of all the hotels I have stayed at in Chicago the Hotel Monaco is by far my favorite."
"Just returned from a Chicago weekend based at the Monaco and was fully satisfied. Room was spacious, well-appointed and spotless. Staff was very accomodating and professional and the restaurant served an excellent brunch (plus a free wine reception every day) Be sure to join their free club to get free wi-fi and a $10 voucher for the bar or mini-bar. Valet parked is $56 per day and you can save by self-parking at several lots within a block. Hotel is easily walkable to many attractions including the Art Institute and shopping."
"We had a great stay Friday - Sunday of Memorial Day weekend at the Hotel Monaco. Had Room 1108 which had cool window seats and a great view of Marina City -- the two sixty story concrete towers which mix parking and unique architecture, as well as the new Trump tower thing.Hotel Monaco is charming and comfortable. Sleep quality is quite high -- we could hear the El wheels squeaking but we got right to sleep -- that wasn't that loud. Water pressure in the showers is terrific. Service and cleanliness of rooms was five stars for us. Front desk, bell stand, etc. very Midwestern courteous. A true pleasure. I think we dealt with about 8 different hotel employees and never heard a cross word or experienced inefficiency -- they fell over themselves helping us out.Business center was great. The printer was one of the best I've ever had in a hotel experience. The Hotel Monaco has a usage charge thing which is a bit obnoxious, but if you brought your laptop you could use the metered computer gizmo just for printing. Again, the printer quality in color was outstanding, enabling us to print off a variety of google maps for tourism in chicago.TIP: Request the in-room Keurig coffee maker. That's a nice wake up cup of Joe. We ate at the restaurant for brunch on Sunday. Did a great job with bacon, omelette was OK. Probably the weakest aspect of our stay. The charge on the parking overnight is like $56, but that's downtown Chicago.Overall, fantastic stay. It is great to be at a comfortable, smaller hotel. We really liked the location. Easy walking distance to Michigan Avenue, Navy Pier, etc. And I enjoyed looking at the Bob Newhart Marina City towers at day or night. Also, it is amazing how cleaned up downtown Chicago is now. Very gentrified. Great riverwalk, etc. We had a terrific visit. Thank you Kimpton."
"I stayed here for four nights in May. Its location, on Wabash at the Chicago River is, to me, perfect for walking all around Chicago. River North, Michigan Avenue, State Street, the Loop, Millenium Park, etc. are all within easy walking distance. The Blue Line direct from the airport drops nearby (at Clark and Lake), so it is convenient to get there using mass transit.Once at the hotel, I was upgraded to a beautiful one-bedroom suite (I am a Kimpton Inner Circle member). The suite, overlooking the Chicago River, was beautifully decorated, quiet, and a serene place to reside while in Chicago. The views from the 4 (yes four, three large (they are about the size of a full-size bed (no lie), one smaller) window seats were amazing. A friend and I sat in them late every night and enjoyed wine and cheese.The bath had a whirpool tub and stand-up shower. My own personal preference would be to have had a slightly larger shower in the room (and I prefer showers that also include a hand-held shower head as well), but it is an older building (like most Kimptons) that has been retrofitted for a new life (and beautifully done).The staff, like almost all Kimptons, was welcoming and friendly. They all sought to make my stay memorable and enjoyable. This began with emails from Erica, the assistant manager (a big shout out to her!), prior to my arrival through every person at the hotel.If you have not stayed at a Kimpton Hotel, you should. And if your trip takes you to Chicago, Hotel Monaco is a superb choice. I highly recommend it.

"Foster is a really nice check-in person who made sure our first stay at a Kimpton Hotel was a pleasant experience. Our room has two bay windows overlooking the Chicago River. It keeps our boys (under 10) occupied. The decor is very mismatched. The bathroom definitely could use some extra storage for toiletries and a change of clothes. Rich, the concierge was irritated with our request for help with our dinner reservation. After spending 8 hours traveling, patience and a helpful attitude is most appreciated. Rich needs to work on this."
"Great staff here and the potential for excellence, however my first night was way below par. We hired a suite (not inexpensive) but in spite of assurances that the sofa-bed would be made up in readiness from my return from supper, we had to chase and chase to get this implemented. Have to say the quality of the sofa-bed was more budget hotel/motel than up-market boutique. Shame, because, it's in a great location with great staff."
"My teenage daughter and I stayed at the Hotel Monaco for a long weekend. It was the perfect choice! She absolutely loved the window seat and view. The hotel staff brought her a down comforter and blankets so she could sleep in it! The entire staff, from the front door to room service, were friendly and accommodating. The location is excellent for shopping, shows, and museums. We have found our Chicago hotel!"
"I truly enjoyed my stay at the Hotel Monaco. The hotel is very well located. Shops are about two blocks away and a number of restaurants nearby.

"We chose Hotel Monaco because of the great reviews and location. We were not disappointed with the location, but found the reviews overrated. Having grown up in the Midwest, I visit my ""hometown"" of Chicago 2-3 times (4-7 day stays) a year and have stayed at many hotels in the downtown area. We chose Monaco this visit for the boutique-ness and the window seats seen from the street.PROS: Extremely nice and quick room service, usually a 15-20 wait and smiling, friendly deliverers. Welcoming door staff, always waiting with a ""hello!"". Nice greeting by desk person upon arrival, we arrived at 11am and got a room by noon. Clean room and excellent maid service. Comfy beds, linens, and pillows. CONS: Not a single ""good morning"" or ""good evening"" greeting from the front desk staff during our entire stay...wow. I initiated a ""good morning"" one day and got blank stares. How difficult is it to greet your customers when they pass by? Called for bell service after our 7-night stay to store luggage before our flight time, waited over 20 minutes, finally lugged our heavy bags (lotsa shopping this trip!) to the lobby ourselves only to see 2 bell staff doing nothing. Front desk staff was somewhat apologetic. Expensive room service, but that's the big city for ya. Honestly felt a bit unwelcome, which we found ridiculous in a small boutique hotel; Usually only encounter this type of unfriendly customer service in larger chains. Probably will not choose Monaco for future stays because we didn't feel welcome any time after arrival; too bad because everything else was nice.

"We LOVED this hotel. My main concern when staying in hotels is cleanliness and I have to say that this hotel room was spotless. While the room was on the smaller side, it is a boutique hotel and the small size was not at all a problem for us. The window seats are AMAZING. We found ourselves sitting and looking out most of the time we were in the room. We slept with the sheer curtains open so that if we woke we had an amazing view. We stayed on the 11th floor. The service from EVERYONE in this hotel was excellent. Our car was brought around promptly each time we requested it. We didn't have a chance to go to the wine hour as we were out both nights we stayed at that time. Location is wonderful! Upon checkout we noticed a charge from the mini bar that we didn't use and it was quickly taken care of. We have no complaints and will be back for sure. My husband forgot his toothbrush (lol) and as soon as it was requested one was brought right up. Need more towels....within a couple of minutes they were at the door. We booked directly through the hotel and got a great price. Parking is high but I looked around and there are some even higher. Personally we didn't mind the cost so much especially after the excellent service we received when requesting our car. I would recommend this hotel to anyone and already have. Perfectly lovely weekend stay and we were not ready to leave! Enjoy!P.S They really do put a goldfish in your room!!! So cute!

"I stayed at the Kimpton Monaco in Chicago while attending a conference. It was a wonderful respite from the busy-ness of the conference. More than that, Matthew (front desk supervisor) and every single staff person made me feel welcomed and well cared for. I was greeted each time I entered and departed the premises, encouraged to attend the afternoon wine reception, reminded of morning coffee, and asked if there was anything they could do to make me more comfortable. The room was lovely; with a nice view of the river. It was quiet and serene. I especially appreciated the in-room yoga mat and wellness station; no need to leave the room to get my work-out in! The hotel is located in the heart of everything (restaurants, the art museum, parks). I just can't say enough about this place, it's staff, and the relaxing stay I enjoyed!

Since the Breakfast was included in the Price, it should at least be of proper quantity and variety.P.S: CHICAGO NOT RECOMMENDED FOR WINTER

"My family visited Chicago (April 2014) for the weekend. We had a wonderful experience at the Hotel Monaco. The hotel is well located to walk everywhere we wanted to go (Institute of Art, American Girl store, etc.) The desk staff whet out of their way to make us (including my children) feel welcome. They were able to arrange a room with a window seat - a fantastic and unique feature. We were greeted and recognized smiles each time we came and went - it was almost like coming home. I travel often and stay in hotels all over the world. This was some of the best service I've experienced. On par with Peninsula, Ritz Carlton and Four Seasons hotels, although not as large and commercial feeling. My 11 year old (who has stayed in some very nice hotels commented that this was the nicest place she has ever stayed). Thank you Hotel Monaco for making the weekend fantastic and easy.

"I stayed at the Hotel Monaco last week for a very short business trip; 1 night. I found the location to be conveniently located and the staff I encountered to be friendly and accomodating. My father lives in Milwaukee, but was unable to drive down, so he took the train. In looking for directions to the Union Station, Frances at the front desk heard me talking with another front desk host. When I arrived back at the hotel with my dad, she welcomed us with a ""This must be Dad!"", which thrilled my father. The room was clean and nicely furnished with very comfortable beds. If I had to find something to criticize, I'd say I could hear road traffic during rush hour even thought we were on the 7th floor, Riverview Room. We walked to Harry Carey's for a delightful dinner... and ate a delicious lunch at the South Water Grill. I saw an unfavorable review for the restaurant and was surprised. There were 2 others in my group that ate later and also thoroughly enjoyed their meals.Maybe it was the menu items?!? I'd also like to commend the Bellmen we encountered while there. Both were friendly and helpful, but one in particular (wish I had his name) declined my tip after hailing a cab for us stating that we'd already taken care of him earlier and he was happy to help! I was shocked someone was turning down cash.My only regret is I was unable to partake in the Kimpton free wine Happy Hour because I was working. Would definitely go back next time my travels take me to Chicago."
"Hotel Monaco is an absolute jewel located conveniently to restaurants, Michigan Ave, and transportation on Wabash near Wacker Dr. I held a meeting for a small executive group with people from all parts of the US and we were very satisfied with the service and accommodations. Since the meeting was informal, I decided to rent a suite and hold the meeting in the living room portion of the room and this turned out to be a great choice. The lobby and common areas of the hotel have a fun and welcoming vibe with a friendly staff that make you feel at home. There is wifi access in the lobby with fun music in the background. Fresh Starbuck's offered gratis in the am and a complement of wines in the evening in the lobby. The concierge service was very helpful and offered up great ideas for dinners out and offered to make reservations. The rooms are appointed beautifully with comfy robes and striking bedding, furniture and accessories. We did not want to leave. The room service staff could not have been more helpful (for one request all we needed was a few spoons and waters and the delivery person could not have been nicer). We dined at sister hotels, the Burnham and Allegro and enjoyed those locales as well. What a treasure!


Room Tip: Ask for a room with a view of the river or Michigan Ave.

"I stayed here for 2 night with my husband in January - right as the polar vortex was hitting Chicago! Rooms were clean and warm, and the bed was very comfortable. The bellman was very helpful - taught us about falling ice and what buildings you should walk right next to and which you should walk closer to the street, so as not to get hit with the falling ice. A close walking distance to the Mag Mile, the ""Bean"" at Millennium Park, etc. The voucher for the mini bar was an added plus. I wouldn't hesitate to stay here again!"
"Everyone at this hotel and its restaurant, South Water Kitchen, were very friendly and helpful. We were always greeted when we walked in the door. The doorman always opened the door and got taxis when we needed them. The concierge made good suggestions about restaurants and got us reservations. Staff at the front desk were friendly and helpful, too. The 5PM wine reception in the lobby was an opportunity to talk to other guests, which we always like to do. The location is very convenient to the things that we wanted to do in Chicago. Bed and room were very comfortable and the room was quiet. Based on our experience here, I would give preference to Kimpton Hotels in the future."
"I've always stayed at the Hyatt when in Chicago, but my last time there was just too much--too many people, not enough fast service, etc. So I opted for the Hotel Monaco this time, and I was VERY pleased! First, I love dogs, so it was nice to see so many animals around. The decor was just beautiful, the staff very nice and helpful, and the room was clean and comfortable. Plus a wine happy hour every day doesn't hurt!It was an easy walk to other places, easy to get a cab to McCormick, and the restaurant next door is top notch (Sweet Water). I will come back!"
"stayed here for a conference. Room was nice and big. Liked the entryway into my room. Gave it a two room feel. Bathroom was off this foyer type area. Tall sink, great water pressure and plenty of hot water. The shower head was also well above my head. Always a plus. Room was very clean and decently stocked mini-bar. Not just food products but also some items you may have forgotten. Side note, some of those should have been free, I.e toothbrush, toothpaste, those are provided at other upscale hotels if a guest is forgetful. Conference room was comfortable and the lunches were your basic conference foods. Filling but just okay. Room 702 does face a parking garage and a wall so not much of a view on my side. Also, the wine tasting ends at 6 on the dot. the room was full and at 6 the wine was taken away. So dont linger if you want to get a glass. When i am in town i may stay here again."
"We've stayed at the Hotel Palomar, another Kimpton Hotel in Chicago, and loved it. Every staff member we met was very friendly, helpful and professional. When we left, we felt like we were leaving new friends, and we looked forward to seeing them again.This was not the case at the Hotel Monaco. The only outstanding staff member was the day shift valet person (I wish I remembered his name). He was friendly and informative from our first greeting to our departure two days later. The front desk was aloof. Once we checked in, we passed the front desk numerous times and they didn't acknowledge, let alone greet us. The concierge was not very helpful. Upon departure we called the front desk and asked for our car from the valet. After quite some time in the lobby, it became obvious our car had not been called up. The only person that seemed concerned about this, was the aforementioned valet person. I'm sure what makes such a dramatic difference in the level of service. It must either be hiring practices, training, management, or a combination. The Palomar is doing something very right and it makes us want to go gack. The Monaco is just another hotel in Chicago to us, and with the host of hotel options in Chicago, I doubt we will ever go back. We've stayed in Holiday Inn Expresses at half the price that had more enthusiastic, helpful and friendly staff than the Monaco. We've stayed at The Trump, Waldorf-Astoria and Ritz-Carlton for twice the price and the staff at the Palomar were every bit as good.The highlight of the Monaco was the padded window ledges. Very nice to sit in, and a very unique feature for hotels in town. It may just be our perception, but the bathroom tile and shower seemed older than the rest of the room. The room was a nice size and it was clean. The beds were too hard for our tastes, and we like firm beds.The location is fantastic. Everything we wanted to do seemed to be within a ten minute walk. We wish we had better news, and as In Touch members we would like to love all Kimpton hotels.


Green Features: We appreciated the small can for recycling items. We used it for bottle, newspapers and magazines that would normally go in the trash."
"Stayed here March 22 - 26 on business, and we had such a great time! My office was hosting an event at their restaurant, South Water Kitchen, so we negotiated a deal on the rooms. Since we hosted an event here, the rooms were pretty affordable. My room had an amazing view of the city, and while my colleague's room did not, she got a nice couch to make up for it. I got new shampoos and soaps every single day, regardless of whether or not I was finished with the last one. Also, I asked for a lint roller from the front desk, and I got a huge, full-size one. Nice!Onto the service. Before I even came to the hotel, I was contacted by someone in reservations to ask if we had any special occasion for being there. I mentioned that we were on business but a colleague of mine was retiring this year, and could they do something nice for her room. Upon check-in, my retiring colleague was met with a bottle of wine and some cake. Very nice! Also, I had asked if we could have some of our conference supplies shipped directly to the hotel since the conference storage fees were really excessive. They held on to our supplies for a few days prior to our arrival, no extra charge. Fantastic! Also, everyone I talked to at the front desk and at the wine hour (which was from 5 - 6PM daily) was really nice. They usually say ""Welcome back!"" or ""Have a great day!"" every time you come back or leave the hotel, which is sweet. Matthew at the front desk was our favorite. My colleagues and I had nice long chats with him about the city, places to go eat, life in general, etc. Nice guy. We had a great time at the Hotel Monaco and will likely be back next year!


Room Tip: Ask for a room with a city view, because it's lovely.

"Stayed here for a business conference at the McCormick centre. Great location, close to the river and an easy walk to trains, restaurants and shopping. Cab fare to the conference was reasonable under $10. The hotel was well appointed and the beds were comfortable. Service was OK. The only downside was that they took a $900 reserve on my credit card at check in, and then charged a further $700 + on departure. The $900 isnt returned to the card until days later. Pretty hard to check in for 3 days without at least $2000 available on your card."
"We stayed at the hotel Monaco for a weekend getaway. It was a wonderful hotel with great service and a great location. We took advantage of an off season price, making this a good value, throw in the complimentary wine happy hour and free wifi and it's a great deal! Rooms are spacious and comfortable. Bathroom is a little tight but it's a boutique hotel. My son has moved up to Chicago and I plan to visit him often. Hope to make Hotel Monaco, my go to hotel!"
"I stayed at this location via a company sponsored training. The location is great!! Downtown, where everything is within walking distance, so convenient. The room was clean, staff was very attentive and hospitable. Complimentary coffee & tea was available each morning as was complimentary wine at the end of the day, which was greatly appreciated. I loved the robes provided and the umbrella, as it rained two days in a row. My stay was great! The only thing that I can complain about was the construction happening next door. I was not as lucky as my co-worker to get a view of the river, instead I had a view of the construction site. There was notification of the construction going on from 8-5, but on most days the construction started at 6'ish. I know they don't have much control of that. Overall my stay was fabulous! I'd certainly stay here again!"
"The Hotel Monaco is a solid choice in downtown Chicago whether you are visiting for business or for pleasure. It's an easy walk to anywhere in the Loop and also to the shopping on North Michigan Ave. The hotel has window seats with lovely views of the river, and the best part is that the view (at least from my room) excluded that new Trump monstrosity across the way. Instead I got to admire the classic Chicago structures of Marina City (the corn cob-looking buildings) and the Mies van der Rohe-designed IBM building next door."
"We stayed for two nights in early March. The location in the loop and across the river from the Magnificent Mile made it a great place to experience what Chicago has to offer. The room was very tastefully decorated. The wine hour was lovely and the hostess was very nice to chat with. The bar that is attached is also very nice. We stopped for a quick drink and appetizer. The service was good and the drinks even better. We always got a cab fast in front of the hotel.Only complaint I would have is to train staff to not air their grievances to guests. I called the day before I checked in to see if I would receive an early check in that was offered through the Kimpton rewards program. The gentleman who answered the call literally sighed after I asked my question and proceeded for two minutes to tell me why the early check in was not honored and it shouldn't be offered. I couldn't believe I sat through this conversation to be honest. I was willing to pay to get in early after riding the train to the city all night, I just needed to know if it was available. Since we took it as we could not get early check in, we stopped to drop our bags after our arrival and found out they where able to get us in a room early! The service at this point made up for the conversation the day before.We would stay here again, just wish the gentleman who answered the phone would be more professional in the future.

"A group of friends and we made this a base for a fun night of St. Patrick's Day festivities. I've stayed at several downtown hotels and this one now leads the pack. It has a bit of a swanky feel but not over the top. Staff are attentive and friendly. Rooms are very uniquely decorated and inviting, some with amazing city & river views with window sill seating. The location is excellent, north side of the loop on the river and close to River North. Although we missed it, they have a complimentary wine reception every day as well as free bike rentals. Another bonus is the attached Sweetwater Tavern & Grille. It has a great vibe and where we enjoyed late night drinks as well as a delicious breakfast. The clincher was that we were able to get a great rate, one of the lowest of all the 4-5 star hotels in downtown. Stay here. You won't be disappointed!


Room Tip: Some rooms have ""window sill seating"" with city and river views.

"The decoration of the room is really stylish. It's not just modern but with a nice touch of exotic flavor. I particularly like the huge bay window which you can sleep there for street (people) watching. The location is great and right in the heart of Chicago. The night I stayed not only had an evening wine tour but also accompanied with music and band. The bed is very comfy and the shower has great water pressure. The room is very clean and everything is in great condition. Compared to most of the other hotels, it has some unexpected touch of details. There is a Yoga mat for guest to practice Yoga. In their TV program there are free Yoga lessons you can follow. In the morning there are free coffees and tea. This is a great hotel that I recommend.


Room Tip: The street facing room may have more noise but compensated with great view of the city

"My teenage son and I stayed in a room at the Monaco late last summer for a mini vacation.The room was wonderful with a great view of the river. The property is very clean, modern and the staff is great. Perfect location for getting around on foot or transit.I have stayed at various properties in Chicago and have to say this is the most preferred. Would recommend without hesitation and will be returning. As a bonus I actually booked thru Priceline so the room rate was a steal."
"Stayed two nights and it was spectacular! Hotel staff was very nice, friendly, and very attentive. Friends birthday and we got fruit, water, and a birthday card signed by the staff. What a personal touch. Shout out to Mike who was wonderful! Foster was awesome as well. Everyone was, you can't go wrong! Stayed on 8th floor, great view! Irish pub across the street. Magnificent mile within walking distance. Restaurant attached was too pricey for our taste. Window seat in hotel room was great for people watching. 7-11 across the street, I recommend for munchies and beer. We will stay here again.

"We stayed at the Hotel Monaco to celebrate our anniversary. We had a lovely river front room. Not knowing it was St. Pat's Day weekend, we woke up see the Chicago River turn green right before our eyes from our hotel window! The front desk staff were so professional and welcoming as were the staff at the complimentary cocktail hour. We even enjoyed our little goldfish friend! Thanks for making our anniversary a special one!


Green Features: I appreciate the thought given to be environmentally friendly. The opportunity to re-cycle was refreshing! Thanks!"
"I hadn't tried this hotel before but booked it for two after some recent less-than-stellar experiences at other Chicago establishments. We liked the professional treatment, the intriguing decor of the room, and the small luxuries: padded window seats, bathrobes and slippers provided, multiple newspapers as well as tea, coffee, and water available down in the lobby, and complimentary wine hour....

"I hadn't tried this hotel before but booked it for two after some recent less-than-stellar experiences at other Chicago establishments. We liked the professional treatment, the intriguing decor of the room, and the small luxuries: padded window seats, bathrobes and slippers provided, multiple newspapers as well as tea, coffee, and water available down in the lobby, and complimentary wine hour. I didn't get to try out the fitness center but was impressed by its spaciousness. Breakfast in the adjoining restaurant was fast and tasty. Just a couple of small reservations: wireless internet was not free, at least to a first-timer, and there seemed to be no privacy sign available to hang on the door handle and the housekeeper knocked at what seemed to us an excessively early hour on the morning of our checkout. Nevertheless, I'd definitely stay here again."
"I was tremendously pleased with the Hotel Monaco. I was in Chicago on business (in February! And I hate winter...) I became suddenly sick with flu-like symptoms. The staff was both efficient, and kind and made what could have been a terrible experience quite nice. The staff were friendly without being intrusive and were very knowledgeable of the hotel and Chicago.The room was spacious, and the bed was very comfortable. I had a federal rate, but for once didn't get stuck with the worst room (the small, dark, terrible view, last room on the hall). The location of the hotel itself couldn't be beat -- close to everything.I have already recommended the hotel to friends who travel to Chicago on a regular basis, and look forward to returning -- when I'm feeling well and can take advantage of the wine tasting and what looked to be a very nice restaurant."
"This was our second stay at a Kimpton property and we were again blown away. We had a king room with a wonderful view down to the river from the comfort of our secluded day bed. The real bed was very comfortable, the furnishings are iconic and fitting of the property and the staff were beyond helpful. Location was within walking distance of almost everything that we were interested in doing and we felt safe walking around during the day and night. Also the proximity to the two train stations meant that we were very self sufficient during our stay. A basket of fruit on arrival, a fish to look after while we were there and some great restaurant recommendations really cemented Hotel Monaco's place in our hearts. We will be visiting again."
"Everything was as good as I expected, nice clean, friendly envitoment, showers can use some improvement, I'm 5'11 and I consider that an standard height, but I couldn't reach the shower head for adjustment, totally out of my reach, it was at least another foot and half from my finger tips, other than that we were satified with the service.

"We stayed here for 6 nights. Would recommend travelers consider this kitschy hotel. The location in the loop and across the river from the Magnificent Mile made it a great place to experience what Chicago has to offer. It has a trendy feel, bold colours and personable staff. The wine reception each night a 5 was an added bonus. The bed was comfortable and floor very quiet. You could hear a low rumble of the ""L"" but we got used to that. We thought it was a very good value given the location. Of course, the was February so maybe this contributed to the reasonable cost."
"My husband and I live in Madison, WI and travel often to Chicago for weekend trips. We have always wanted to stay in this hotel, so when I saw a sale for a weekend we were already planning to go to Chicago, I jumped at the chance to book this hotel. I'm glad I did! It is a beautiful boutique hotel filled with a lot of neat features. I received an e-mail about a week prior to our stay, asking if there were any upgrades I wanted to sign up for (with no guarantee, but it was still neat to see what they had available). When we checked in, we were upgraded to a ""high rise floor."" Our room was beautifully appointed and was... large! I was not expecting that much space for a hotel in downtown Chicago. The rooms also were considered ""tall rooms"" with high ceilings. This was great because my husband and I are both pretty tall (I'm 5'10"" and my husband is 6'3""), and the room even had a very tall shower!The hotel is also pet friendly, which is great. I unfortunately have extreme allergies to cats and was concerned about this. But, I notified the hotel before checking in, and we were placed in a pet-free room (confirmed to me by the hotel manager). I didn't see a single animal on our floor the whole weekend (and saw quite a few in the lobby, so I was pleased to know our room was safe).We ordered room service both mornings and the food was pretty tasty. I really appreciated all the healthy options (i.e. whole grain breads/waffles).The location was great and we had a lovely time! We look forward to visiting again soon!

"I have been traveling to Chicago on business for years, and I always stay at Monaco. I love the free wine reception in the evening, and the ambiance of the lobby. There is free coffee and tea every morning as well, and I Love that too! The hotel staff and Concierge are awesome! The rooms are very clean and comfortable. My only complaint would be the floor layout...the bathroom doors are very awkward in most of the rooms. When you enter the bathroom the door butts up to toilet, making it a tight fit to get in and out. I have stayed at other hotels in the Loop, but I always come back to Monaco."
"I recently was surprised this past weekend with a nights stay here for my birthday. I was told the room we stayed in was the best in the building, and I wouldn't disagree. The room's amenities included a giant comfy king bed, two televisions (one in the sitting room and one in the bedroom) and deep seated hot tub, and an AMAZING view. Each window is fitted with cushion seat, so you can crawl up into the window and really see everything. The staff was wonderful, I can't count how many people greeted me and told me ""Happy Birthday,"" it was really sweet. There is also a happy hour from 5-6 where they offer free cocktails to their guests. I was seriously impressed with my stay and would recommend it to anyone.

"I am a big fan of Kimpton hotels and this one is one of my favorites. The location is wonderful - central location so you can walk many places and quick access to ""the L"". A horrendous plane trip end caused us to be almost 12 hours late, but a call to the front desk assured us that a room with our preferences would be waiting, and it was. The room itself is pretty basic, though quite comfortable (the pillows are great), but it is the little things that make this hotel. The sitting area in the lobby is inviting, the wine hour at the end of the day is a great way to transition to evening events, and the recommendations by the staff on local places to eat were spot on - in short, great personal service and amenities at a price that is below the big hotels. Throw in free wifi if you join their InTouch program, and this is an outstanding value."
"Room service menu is very limited. I'm staying here a week so this is a problem, it's like being at a local dive in the middle of nowhere. I called for room service at 9pm, was told they'd call me back (7 minutes later and after I got undressed), they did. I tried to order but they closed. It says on their menu they serve dinner until 10pm - but, ""There was nobody in here so we closed it two hours early."" (at 8pm vs. 10pm, as stated on the menu), without warning. They offered to go across the street to get me food at a bar, but I don't eat fried bar food. It's nearly 10pm, no food available and unimpressed. At 9:48pm, I would have been finished with dinner by now and getting ready for bed. Now, I will be up late and have to eat at 10:30pm. Not a good time to eat or way to start the work week. Not a great experience. Bye Kimpton Hotels!"
"the I stayed for four nights on a business trip. The hotel is conveniently located both for Downtown/South Loop and a short walk to the shopping on North Michigan Ave. My room was very nice (1217) - the view was nothing much to write home about, but everything else was great. If you join the InTouch programme you get free internet and a $10 credit for the mini bar. Front desk staff and doorman were on the whole very friendly and provided great service. Wine hour was a nice touch. Two recommendations: a coffee machine in the rooms would be good, without having to ask for it (a machine was provided very promptly when I asked), and when I requested a later check out on the morning of my last day the person to whom I spoke was rather snitty and said I could check out at 3pm for a $50 payment. As it was a Sunday and many people seemed to be checking out I thought that was unreasonable. We ate in the South Water Kitchen restaurant - decor was nothing to write home about and the windows were dirty, but the food was lovely and the service friendly. I will definitely stay at the Monaco if I return to Chicago."
"This is the best hotel at which I have stayed in Chicago. The room was large and comfortable and well decorated. Front desk was efficient and helpful. We checked in before 1 PM and that was no problem. Housekeeping was very efficient. Our room was cleaned before noon on all four days. The doormen were amazing. They had our bags out of the trunk and on the way to the front desk before we were out of the taxi. Same when we were leaving, they took them from us at the desk. Also as it was snowing much of this visit yet they managed to always keep the sidewalk and driveway clear. As with other Kimpton hotels the 5-6 wine hour is the highlight of the day. Good wine, nice snacks and an opportunity to relax in the lobby and meet other guests. I will definitely return next time I visit Chicago."
"I travel 5-15 days per month and stay in my fair share of hotels. However, I always look forward to my trips to Chicago because it's like going home to visit family when I stay at the Hotel Monaco Chicago. The service is outstanding, the rooms are relaxing and comfortable, the staff is extremely friendly and treats you like an MVP every time you're there. If you're a Kimpton Hotel member you get $10 of treats from the mini-bar for free and the free nights add up quickly with the Kimpton In-Touch rewards program.Hotel Monaco Chicago is truly my home-away-from-home!

"I love this boutique hotel. My room was really comfortable and clean. I was on the 6th floor and could hear some traffic, but overall it was really quiet. I couldn't hear other guests at all. I echo other reviewers when I say spending the extra money for a river view is well worth it. Grab a hot toddy from the lobby (free between 5 & 6) then climb in to your window seat (giant and more like a bed than a seat) and enjoy the river and Chicago architecture. I also liked being in the loop near State street and tons of public transportation. Also, easy to walk down Michigan Avenue north to shopping and restaurants.


Room Tip: Splurge for the river view

"Just returned from a long weekend trip to Chicago to celebrate my daughter's 18th Birthday. I surprised her with a surprise girls weekend for just the two of us. This was my first time staying at the Monaco as well as my first stay with a Kimpton Hotel. I must say I am impressed with the brand and will likely seek out Kimpton hotels for future stays. I reserved a double queen river view room. We arrived around 10pm (late due to delays in Cleveland). The front desk staff were very friendly. They said happy birthday to my daughter and let me know that we have complimentary wifi since we are Kimpton In touch members. It just takes a few minutes to become a member and it's free, so I highly recommend everyone do that before you go. You are also able to complete room preferences as well. Additionally, I recommend everyone ""like"" the Kimpton Hotels facebook page. You will also find out about some great little incentives by liking them. I found out that sometimes, Kimpton has a ""secret"" word. If you reveal this secret word at check in - you get something special. For me it was a bottle of wine and a fruit basket (both were great). Now, back to our stay :)We were checked in quickly and on our way to our room which was on the 14th floor. We enter the room and there is a gift bag and a card for my daughter. The gift bag is filled with a Chicago coffee cup and some candy goodies. The card is a cute little birthday card signed by the employees. I thought this was really thoughtful. I was a little disappointed that there wasn't a goldfish (as I know she would have thought that was so cool - but she didn't know about them anyway so no harm no foul). I then pointed out the window seats to her and she LOVED them! Actually, she loved everything about our room (including the animal print robes). So, if you are going with teenagers or young adult (actually, I am certain small children would LOVE those window seats as well) you can't really go wrong. Did I mention our view? Well, it was spectacular!! I wish I would have had time to sit in the window seat and just read and enjoy the view more! The room was very clean (and I inspect everything). The bathroom was larger than I expected (based on the online pics). I was especially concerned about there being a lack of counter space, but found it to be ample. There was more than enough room for a curling iron, hair dryer and waver, as well as make up bags, hair spray, make up remover.....etc etc. Ladies, if you are contemplating bringing your hair dryer or not, I would recommend you bring. Especially if you are picky about them, as I am. The shampoos and soaps are C.O. Bigelow and I loved them. I personally have never tried them, but I buy their shaving cream for my husband and it's the only one that he will use. I think I might start buying them going forward for myself. The down pillows that I request in my profile for the kimpton in touch members were on both beds. Oh, and the beds......oh so comfortable! There is a mini refrigerator with soda and some wine, bottled water, beer etc. The only complaint I have and it's really not a complaint....more like an observation.....is that some areas need a little bit of love. There were a few cracked tiles in our bathroom that had missing pieces that could be replaced and some skuffs, etc along the walls as you are walking to your room. I am very picky about carpeting and found it to be very clean in our room, as well as the bathroom floors. Housekeeping was great. We put the do not disturb sign on our room and were not disturbed. When we left for the afternoon (one day after 1pm) our room was still serviced. The housekeeping staff even left a birthday cake (made of towels and wash cloths) one day for my daughter.We did order some food from the restaurant to take back up to our room. It was about 10:30 and they closed at 11. I didn't want to dine in and hold anyone up and asked if we could just order to go. They were very accommodating. We ordered the pulled pork sliders, a chicken flat bread pizza, some garlic fries and mussels for my daughter. They offered to carry it up to our room for us, but my daughter said she could carry it. The food was very good to meh. I LOVED the pulled pork sliders and would highly recommend. My daughter loves mussels (eww) and I tried one and determined again that they are just not for me. However, she loved them and it was a nice size portion. The chicken flatbread was really the only thing that fell short. It was just a little on the bland side. The staff inside the restaurant that we came in contact with were all very pleasant and I am certain you would have nothing less than excellent service while dining in the restaurant. On another note, one night we also had a sweet tooth and saw that they have chocolate chip cookies on their room service menu. We are slightly chocolate chip cookie snobs lol and so my daughter called down to inquire about the chocolate chip cookies. The person she spoke to made sure our cookies were made fresh for us (now I don't know if that is typical or if they bake them ahead of time). However, our cookies arrived to our room hot and they were good! Nothing better than warm chocolate chip cookies! It's little things like these that set this hotel brand apart from others. Their wine hour is great too. I only enjoyed it the night we were leaving, however it was really nice. There were red and white wine offerings and also a choice of Hot Toddy or warm cider. Being that it was 10 degrees outside, I was completely down with the Hot Toddy which was exactly what I needed to get warm and cozy. They were also serving some flatbread pizza at the time as well. The gentleman who was serving the drinks was extremely friendly and polite! On our last day there, our flight didn't leave until 9pm so they held our luggage for us. It was no problem for them to hold it and no issues getting it back! The doorman was very helpful to wave down a cab for you anytime you should need one and always there to greet you whenever you are coming or going and to answer any questions you might have. If you want to buy a few refreshments for your room, there is a 7-11 a 2 minute walk away. We had to visit as I do not drink coffee, but love my diet Dr. Pepper in the morning! The location of the hotel was great. About a $30 cab ride from Midway airport. No more than like 10-15 dollar cab ride to pretty much anywhere. We walked to Michigan Avenue easily. There is also a lowes theater nearby and we saw a late movie one night. The water tower, Hancock building, Navy Pier and museums are around an $8 cab ride (If I remember correctly). We were very happy with the location. Overall, we were very happy with our stay at Hotel Monaco and look forward to staying with a Kimpton hotel in the near future. Oh, and if anyone from Kimpton is reading this......Cleveland Ohio could use your hotel brand!!!


Room Tip: We were in room 1415 (only 14 floors) and had a spectacular view from our room!!

"We stayed here for a weekend getaway to Chicago. An amazing property. The staff went above and beyond anything we have ever experienced at a hotel to help us celebrate our engagement. The room was clean, modern and the perfect space for our needs. Our room had a beautiful view of the river and downtown Chicago. The pet goldfish to greet us in the room was a plus too! The restaurant in the hotel was great, awesome innovative drinks. I had room service breakfast one morning. It come up quickly and was delicious. I loved our stay and would highly recommend this hotel to anyone staying in chicago! The price was very reasonable for the accommodations as well.  (Note: We choose to self park at a nearby self park garage for $44/day instead of using valet at $56)

"The hotel was terrific in every way, arrived weary from traveling through snow storms. Front desk was there was a smile and efficient. Offered a welcome glass of wine and upstairs to a beautiful room - Great view. This hotel is in a wonderful location, is nicely decorated, spotlessly clean and staff is friendly and helpful. Would recommend in a heartbeat! I will be back Hotel Monaco (perhaps in the spring when you can walk around!). Thank you for a much needed comfortable stay."
"Located in the heart of downtown Chicago just south of the river and just off of Michigan Avenue, this gem of a hotel is an oasis in a city cluttered with high end sparkling high rise hotel. The staff was gracious and efficient. The room was ready even though I had checked in early on a Friday afternoon. The room was plenty big with a spacious bathroom and well appointed room. While the view outside my window was less than thrilling, the room more than made up for it. The afternoon wine reception did not disappoint. Fairly decent wine with a few snacks to keep you filled up until diner time. THe check out went just as smoothly and swiftly as the check in. GOod rates most of the time and within walking distance of most of Chicago's major attractions."
"I stay in Kimpton properties almost exclusively for work, so I've seen a lot of them. The Monaco Chicago is definitely one of the best I've stayed in so far. As others have said, the hotel location is great, and the public/room decor is modern and hip but not overpoweringly so. My room was spotlessly clean, the wifi worked flawlessly, and there's an easily accessible business center that really helped me when I was in a pinch. What really set the Monaco apart for me, however, was the staff. From the doorman to the bell services staff to the front desk, everyone I encountered was genuinely warm and friendly. Business travel is often a lonely thing, but the Monaco staff made me feel truly welcome every time I entered the lobby.Although the attached restaurant - South Water Kitchen - really merits its own review, special props to Dan the bartender. Not only is he one of the most talented bartenders I've ever encountered, he's also one of the nicest. If I was a Chicago local, I'd go out of my way to sit at his bar.An all around great stay at the Monaco."
"We stayed at the Hotel Monaco for four nights on a pleasure trip to Chicago. The hotel is really in a great location because it is within walking distance of many of the sites in Chicago. Even though it was freezing cold in Chicago, we were able to comfortably walk to many of the good shopping areas and to restaurants. We walked easily to Millennium Park and to the Art Institute. We also walked comfortably to the Architecture Foundation to participate in tours. The personnel at the front desk of the Monaco were quite helpful in giving us directions and also in helping us figure out routes for the public transportation system which is also easily accessible from the hotel. They were always pleasant and very accommodating. We asked to change rooms one day so that we could have a larger window and they willingly met our request.The deluxe river view rooms are a little small but the view from the window (particularly the rooms with larger windows) is quite nice particularly at night when the river area is lit up. The beds were comfortable and generally everything that we needed was available. We did not particularly care to go downstairs to get coffee in the morning and they did not hesitate to get us a coffee maker for our room. They also have a wine hour for guests each day which is a very nice treat. Overall it was a pleasure to stay here.

"This is the best hotel in downtown Chicago. It is beautiful and clean. The staff was so pleasant and helpful. The rooms were very clean and the beds were so comfortable. We stayed on the 5th floor 2 queen bedroom and had a view of the front street. The windows were large and had window seats. The bathroom was clean and had large mirrors and lighted makeup mirrors nice free products and fluffy towels--never had to ask for more towels here. Free wine at 5:00pm was a nice treat and to meet our friends in town. Doormen were so polite and always smiled and had something nice to say everytime we came and went. Very easy to get a cab. Good food within walking distance. The L is right around the corner.Perfect get-away A+++

"We picked this hotel as it was a boutique hotel and were not disappointed. At every step of our stay we were greeting with smiling , helpful people. My sister and I arrived and we were meeting another sister who was to arrive several hours later. The front desk ensured that she was going to be on the same floor and in fact was in the hotel room next door.The staff booked us into restaurants, looked up information for us and it never felt like it was a chore.we found the location of the hotel great. Our room had a view of the Chicago River and we often sat in the window seat and looked out. It was so close to the theatres and we were able to walk to see our play. We were close to the hop on hop off bus and the local boat tour docks. Location Location Location. It was great.The rooms and hotel had an art deco decoration and we loved the complimentary happy hour.I would definately recommend staying here."
"We had a river view room with a window seat. The room was decorated in well very funky. The window seat is actually the size of a twin mattress, that looks out over the city. Very different than the typical hotel room. The bathroom was on the small size with little room for toletries around the sink, but you are not in Chicago to hang in the bathroom. The black out curtins were super, it felt like midnight at 9am. Room was also pretty quiet, did not hear much noise from hall. yes the room is small but it is an older building. For two of us for one night it was fine. I would not try and fit a family. The room service was not so good we ordered breakfast and they got the order wrong, and the bagle was dry as dust. We did not use attched restaurant or join the nightly wine fest. The lobby is on the small size and I did not want to stand in a crowd for a glass of wine.


Room Tip: get a room with the river view and window seat its worth it

"Everything about this place, with the exception of the price, reminded me of a DIY home remodeling project done on a shoe string budget. Everything looks good...on the surface. Take for example the river view rooms with their big calling card window seats. The bellman needed to push a super heavy divan out of the way in order to access the window seat which was about 48 inches from the ground. I'm tall with long legs so I was able to hop up. My traveling companion would have required a step stool. The upholstery on the window seat appeared to have been hot glued and stapled. DIY. At nearly $500 per night one expects a very nice bathroom, and yet in this case you get a small granite vanity top, one sink and a tub kit with a shower curtain.The lobby looks interesting, but again the pieces seem to be ""less than."" It looks good on the surface, but has a cheap feel. The evening wine event is nice, if far too crowded and understaffed.We were there on a Friday with a Saturday check out, so perhaps that is why the staff at the front desk was snippy and incredibly unpleasant, which is so different from what one usually finds in Chicago. They were unpleasant when we checked in and grumpy when we checked out. I have to say the people with whom I dealt on the phone while making the rez were incredibly pleasant and helpful. Perhaps they should be the public face of this hotel and the grouches behind the front desk could answer phones in a back room. Just a thought.We were assured that the $56 per night parking fee was the ""cheapest in the Loop."" The doormen and bellmen were cheerful, helpful and really really sweet.


Room Tip: If you plan to enjoy the window seat be sure to ask for a small step stool!

"I just stayed at the Hotel Monaco with my husband during the Chicago Marathon and had a wonderful experience. The rooms are big and have amazing pillows and linens. Try to get a room with a view because the window seats are my favorite feature of the hotel and they allow you to literally watch the amazing city of Chicago from the comfort of your room. The location is safe and close to parks, museums, and shopping. The staff's recommendations for dinner were great too and everyone was helpful and courteous. I would stay here again.


Room Tip: Pick a room with a view and also a high floor to avoid noise. Double beds are not big.

"Chicago is one of our favorite cities and our stay at Hotel Monaco was very pleasant! The staff was very warm, friendly and quite informative. The hotel itself is very nicely put-together. The decor is colorful, fancy, and fun. We absolutely loved the room - the bed was very comfortable, all amenities were available, and everything was squeaky-clean. Our room was quite spacious (which is rare for any downtown hotel). Our maid would leave a lovely note on the bed for us each day after servicing our room. One of my favorite things about this hotel is that it had window seating with cushions! Location is also key as everything is within walking distance to many prime locations. The views are to die for as it is situated right on the river! When we come back we will most definitely stay here again!"
"This is not some large glitzy hotel- butIf you are looking for pleasant surroundings, good service and a good location- this is the place for you.Not too expensive, right by the chicago river and around the corner from the entrance to the Magnificent mile- you cannot go wrong with this small, quant and very excellent hotel.Even their restaurant is first rate-excellent drinks and the best flatbread aroundI really liked this place and highly recommend it......

"For a first time trip to Chicago, this hotel could not have been more perfect. The location is awesome and so many things are within walking distance. We had a river view room and it was absolutely gorgeous. The window seat was one of the highlights of the room. You could sit and relax and enjoy the breathtaking view of the city. The room was incredibly clean and the bed was like sleeping on a cloud. Next time I go to Chicago I am definitely staying here again."
"I had the opportunity to spend about 16 days in the Hotel Monaco in downtown Chicago. Its my favorite place to spend an extended visit in Chicago. The location is exceptional but its the Staff that keeps me coming back for more. The way I was welcomed each and every morning and afternoon made me feel like I was at home. A warm Good Morning Greeting early every day and a Big Smile and How are you on the return each afternoon. The room was very comfortable with a very nice bed and linen with a well thought out desk with plenty of power connections and good WiFi connection. But again, its the people that make the hotel so comfortable and in my eyes so successful. The front desk staff - Ericka, Foster, Dana and Kim are super professional and friendly; always willing to help with information and ensuring the guest are having a great stay. Peter and Jorge at the front door set the tone for the stay with big smiles and a Welcome as soon as you pull up to the front to check in and return every day. In the Southwater Kitchen, the servers like Paul make the meal enjoyable and offer great guidance for a change up to the daily breakfast routines.


Room Tip: The Southside of the hotel has some construction going on so perhaps there is a bit of noise on that...

"I was in Chicago to attend a corporate event hosted at the Hotel Monaco. From the minute I walked in the door the staff was very accommodating, helping me find local eateries and get acclimated to the hotel. Few hotels understand what good customer service is. This hotel is different. The people who work there are concerned with guest satisfaction and it shows.


Room Tip: The hotel is near the train tracks. Not their fault but you might ask if there is a quieter room.

"I always try to stay in a Kimpton Hotel when I travel because of their unique surroundings and attention to guest detail. This was my first stay at the Hotel Monaco and it lived up to my expectations. It sits in the perfect locaion for walking to the Michigan Ave Shops and Restaurants and also to the downtown stores and theaters. I took my daughter with me and she stated that it was one of the coolest hotels that she had ever stayed in. Every area of the hotel is very clean and decorated so nice. I asked when I checked in if I could could get a room with two beds and I was told ""no problem"". They upgraded me to a large room for no extra charge. The 5 o'clock complementary wine reception is such a lovely touch as was the morning coffee. They also stored our luggage for us until we left in the evening. I will definately stay at this hotel again."
"I stayed at the Monaco for one night (first time there or a Kimpton hotel in general) and was so impressed that I would recommend it to anyone in heartbeat and stay there again. I had a river view room which was awesome because it overlooked the river and Trump Tower was right in front. The nook in the window is such a neat and cute place to look at the view too. They even give you a pet fish if you ask for one. The room was super clean and trendy. South Water Kitchen is conveniently connected so you don't even have to step outside to walk to a restaurant for good food. 15-20 minute walk from Union Station and very close to State and Michigan shopping.

"I was very excited to stay at the hotel after reading reviews. Sadly I was really disappointed with the room and hotel. The decor was modern but uncomfortable. The bathroom was in need of updating. The room service was yucky (ordered a grilled cheese that came on whole grain bread halfway cooked). If you are an avid traveler and have stayed at many modern hotels, this one falls short. I would not stay here again."
"Hotel Monaco was phenomenal. This was our first stay at the Monaco and a Kimpton Hotel. We were very impressed!! The front desk staff was incredibly friendly and the doorman were probably the nicest I've ever encounted. When we were walking to our room from the elevator even the housekeeper greeted us with a big smile. The rooms were incredibly well done. Leopard print robes, very clean, beautifully decorated. Though our room didn't have a great view, the location of the hotel more then made up for it. You were walking distance to great restaurants and Michigan Avenue. We will definitely stay here again.

"Central - near the river and within walking distance of major attractions. Unfortunately my first room was on level 5, looking out on an internal block, with very noisy machinery - air conditioners? - below. Also, the cleaner had not taken all the rubbish away so on request, I was moved to the 12th floor. Quiet, but not lucky enough to get a view. Room was a good size and amenity OK. Service courteous. Overall, a mixed experience."
"Enjoyed the Monaco in Philly, so decided to try the Chicago version, and Wow, I wasn't disappointed at all. Three nights in a 9th floor river view room for a decent price, what else could one ask for. The staff is great, holding luggage for early arrives, calling when the room is ready, delivering wine to the room when we missed the wine hour, suggesting restaurants, friendly greetings... I was impressed. The location is perfect, a few steps from the River Walk and Metro. The room was surprising quiet and the bed and window couch were quite comfy. Although we didn't use them the hotel has several bikes for free uses by guests. Wifi was decent and the robes in the room are a nice touch. Needless to say, if I'm in Chicago again, I'll be staying at the Monaco!"
Loved our stay there last week for our anniversary! One of the best hotels I've stayed at. We booked the Mediterranean Suite and when we arrived we received a free upgrade to the Riverview one. We were on the top floor corner room overlooking the river. GORGEOUS VIEWS! Decor was great!! Favorite aspect was the window seats that had cushions and pillows. We would sit up there and take in the views. Location is perfect. Walking distance to Magnificent Mile and Millenium Park.
"We checked-into the Hotel Monaco for a 3-night family ""mini-vacation"" with our 3 year-old and 5 month-old. Having researched the property extensively in advance, we reserved a Mediterranean Suite and received Room 905. The suite had a nice, partial view of the Chicago River, along with a city view of Wabash Ave. My older son absolutely loved the window seats and could have watched the El go by for hours if we let him! ;) We enjoyed the whimsical design of the Monaco's rooms. For having a ton of various patterns, it was fun, friendly, and a relaxed style. The suite itself provided ample room for us to setup a crib and cot (as well as a separate room to hang out in once the kids went to bed!). The only disappointment was the small bathroom setup. For a larger-sized suite, I have never experienced such a small shower stall or lack of counter-space. Certainly beneath my expectations for a property of this caliber. The staff at the Monaco were absolutely terrific. They were warm, welcoming, and terrific with our kids. We truly felt ""special"" and appreciated thanks to their efforts. If you're looking for a great location, a unique vibe, and a staff that welcomes (and frankly, dotes on!) families, definitely consider the Hotel Monaco Chicago. We're glad we did.


Room Tip: You're already spending big $ to stay here to begin with. Go for a room with a river view.

"In Chicago with friends for the SGK 3Day, and wanted to get some sight-seeing in pre-walk. Since we had reservations for Sunday night after the event, I asked if the hotel would hold our bags on Thursday for a few hours before we had to head to the group hotel 22 miles away. No problem! Ryan, the concierge was extremely sweet and helpful. He made a lunch reservation for us, and invited us to have some complimentary wine when we returned. The bellman (so sorry I don't have his name) was helpful and sweet with directions to the train and off to Glenview. Peter, the doorman quickly hailed a cab and made sure we knew where we were going. On our return on Sunday night after the walk, we were thrilled to find glasses wine in our room compliments of Ryan again (he was now off-duty). The doorman remembered us and wished a warm welcome and asked how everything went. Rich at the front desk quickly made dinner reservations around the corner at Morton's even warning them that we were a little noisy and dressed like, well, like we had just walked 60 miles. The restaurant was equally inviting, provided a table immediately, and not worried about our appearance at all, even though they were quite full. By the time we left, we all felt like we were leaving friends. We were very well taken care of and the accommodations were lovely."
"Just arrived home from our first stay in Chicago. Lovely room excellent decor, very comfortable king size bed and Egyptian sheets. Only slight problem was lack of hanging space in wardrobe, and no shower gel in bathroom. Little things in an otherwise great stay. The best thing is the location as it is 5 minute walk to the Wendale river and lake boat trips, and Michigan Avenue!I would definitely stay here again!

"Stayed there for a girls weekend and it was fabulous! The room was beautiful, clean and large enough for 4 women to share! Loved the meditation bump outs and the decor of the room. I would definitely stay there again and the location was perfect. We took the train ($5) from the airport into town and the hotel was only a few blocks away. The train took maybe 45 minutes and since we arrived at 7:30 am that was a better choice then taking a taxi and sitting in traffic. The staff (night and day) were so friendly. We had many laughs with all of them!! Still laughing about ""Android"" ! ""The free wine hour was great...get there early the seats fill up fast :). Thanks for the fabulous stay, can't wait to visit again!"
"We arrived from O'Hare airport via the blue line cta train (cost $5 one way or put more on a card as we did for use over the three days we spent in Chicago) and a short walk from the 'Clark/Lake' station got us to this excellent hotel. We were so impressed with the decor as we walked in but the view we got of the river from our brilliantly thought out window seats meant we thought we'd been upgraded! This place is very central for all of the places we wanted to visit such as millenium park and the Willis Tower as well as certain restaurants we had researched and wanted to visit. The staff were so freindly and helpful, even posting some jeans to us that I had left in our room to New Orleans ensuring they got there before we left the USA. We missed the free wine tasting every night but only because we filled our days so full, we needed to spend much more time in Chicago than the time we had allocated. The reception staff were as good as any we've seen in almost 40 years of world travel as were the bar and restaurant staff.Free Starbucks coffee every morning in the lobby area was very welcome and was a really good start to the day. Even the quality of products in the bathroom was impressive (my wife knows these things). We didn't have a car until the day we left because we knew parking was difficult in Chicago and just used the cta train system even to go the whitesox game and visit the Chicago music exchange. The hotel was a great choice and probably the best of the five we stayed at on this trip, the trouble is when you start at an hotel as good as this the rest are always going to be compared unfavourably. My wife was the one who was insistant that we show our appreciation of a great stay here but I also felt it was the least we could do. We hope anyone reading this that visits this hotel gets the same experience we did. John and Karen"
"We loved the hotel Monaco. Upon arrival we were given a room with a city view - a fantastic raised window seat looking out over Chicago. The room itself was very nicely decorated with a sense of style and fun, and a really comfortable bed. The price was reasonable - although we booked many months ahead - and included a continental breakfast that was superb, a big plate of fruit and a choice of various toast/bagels/muffins etc. All the staff in the hotel were consistently polite and eager to be of assistance. We took full advantage of the free wine hour - everyday from 5 till 6 where you can get (several!) free glasses of wine. The hotel also has free wi-fi. However, perhaps most importantly for us, the location is superb, and allows for walking access to the city's main attractions from the Hancock Centre and Navy Pier in the North, through Millenium Park down to the museum campus to the South. All in all, a fantastic, well-run hotel with great facilities and a top-class location. Highly recommended.

"A great hotel, in a wonderful location in Chicago. It's charming and fun but professional with great service and some really special touches.We were very pleased when we found the Monaco at a great rate through a third party site. But next time I'll book directly with Kimpton. Their AAA rate is comparable to what we found plus you get some really worthwhile extras through Kimpton. And probably no hiccups (we did have one). But the site introduced us to a hotel we hadn't looked at before and really loved, so that's good! We'd been considering several other hotels - actually had a reservation - but cancelled it when we found the Monaco. We'd never stayed at a Kimpton before, and honestly the decor didn't immediately appeal to me. However, it's high approval ratings and it's location and the fact that it was comparable in price to the other hotels we'd considered which didn't get nearly such good approval ratings, prompted us to book it. And the more we read, the more we got excited. I will be looking at Kimpton hotels first now. The location is absolutely perfect: a block west of Michigan Avenue and shopping, walkable for riverfront cafes or for boat rides, for drinks at the Trump Tower, the ""L"", Millennium Park and the Art Institute. They also loan bikes to ride along the lakeshore which, unfortunately, we didn't have time for. And now I love the decor. It's not bland! It was fun. Have I said that enough?Our first room was lovely but didn't have two beds (the hiccup - we needed another for our daughters) but they solved the problem that night and moved us for the next 3 nights. The new room overlooked the river and had the most wonderful views of Marina Towers and the Trump Tower from the deep window seats which couldn't have been more perfect for my daughters. They both sat and read and worked on their laptops in the windows. It also had a walk in shower which for me was perfect as I'd recently had knee surgery and climbing into a bathtub to take a shower had been surprisingly difficult. Thank you Frances, it was a great help.Thought I'd miss the in-room coffeemaker - though you can ask for one - but it turns out that the coffee in the lobby was delicious (Starbucks?) and I so enjoyed going down and getting the coffee and the NYT and having an hour to myself, working on my laptop at a special counter in the lobby, that I didn't want the coffeemaker making a noise in the room, waking everyone else up.We were visiting Chicago, my husband's home town, for a wedding and my hair curling tongs broke as I was getting ready. Room service delivered an emergency set of tongs within 10 minutes. One of the staff also found my camera in the lobby one evening and had it ready at reception for me the next morning when I checked if it had been handed in. All of us enjoyed the happy wine hour which was lively and buzzing on the first and only day (of the 4 we stayed) that we were able to make it. We were to move rooms the day of the wedding and the staff arranged for all our things to be moved to the new room after we'd left. It was thrilling to come in at night and see the lights of Marina Towers and the Trump Tower opposite. And I haven't mentioned the animal print robes! Such fun. As well as the decor. We had a blast. We don't ever remember enjoying a hotel stay more. (We went on to an awful hotel in Pittsburgh for the next weekend which made the Monaco seem especially wonderful!)Not sure if it was the concierge or if he was one of the front desk attendants who went above and beyond for us too, on his day off! He arranged tickets for 10 of my husband's family to go on the architectural boat tour. (My husband asked him about it very late one night and so the concierge called on our behalf the next day - his day off!) It was a spectacular day for the tour. And cheaper than if we'd arranged it ourselves.This hotel was a very wonderful treat. And yet it was as reasonable as the other hotels we'd considered. We'll definitely go back. We had a lot of fun and loved our stay here.

"First off i will say the hotel itself was very nice, clean and centrally located. Now for the bad. I booked my trip to the hotel monaco for a small group so we needed 2 rooms. Upon check in the hotel did not have 2 rooms available. The desk clerk promptly got the manager since she could only find one room. The manager then said not to worry he would find us a room. About a minute later we were handed keys to the second room, to our surprise upon opening the door to the room we found the lights off and people sleeping in the room!! I went downstairs to speak with the manager who claimed that these people must be there illegally and that it would take hours to get them out. They then sent us to the Club Quarters around the corner for the night. The hotel said i would not be charged for the night since they didn't have a room for us. I am still waiting to receive credit for that!! We were able to check in the following morning and the stay from there on was great. The hotel staff was very appoligetic regarding the incident the evening before but it just didn't start the trip out well."
"I've stayed in Kimpton's in Chicago before and always liked them so thought I would try Hotel Monaco this time. The room was spacious & they include a yoga mat in every room! You can even call down to the desk to get a yoga block & strap. On TV, they have free yoga & Pilates classes. What a great way to get an early workout in without leaving the room. I also went to the gym one day. It's surprising large. I ran on the treadmill. I was initially bummed since I forgot my headphones but they provided headphones as well as icy cold water. The staff was very friendly & I was even able to get early check in. I will definitely look to stay here on my next trip (and I get to Chicago pretty often for work!)

"This was our second stay at Hotel Monaco and it didn't disappoint. The staff continues to excel in customer service. They always acknowledge their guests and are attentive to any needs. The housekeeping is immaculate. The lobby was remodeled since our visit in 2012 and additional seating was added, which is nice for their evening wi e hour. I suggest the river view rooms...I love sitting in the window seat watching the city below or reading. I will not hesitate to stay again and definitely recommend Kimpton Hotels."
"A friend of mine and I stayed in a double room on the 8th floor for four nights. Our room overlooked Wabash and was quiet and pretty large. The beds were very comfortable, and the bathroom was roomy and well-maintained. We made use of the in-room refrigerator and safe. The wi-fi was excellent compared with other hotels. We were in town during an oppresive heat wave, but our room stayed comfortable.The location was fine, with easy access to mass transit. We were able to walk to the Art Institute and even the John Hancock Center.The concierge gave us a good recommendation on a local steakhouse, and the entire staff was knowledgeable and courteous during our entire stay. We also enjoyed the hotel's complimentary happy hour/live music a couple of late afternoons.One of the two hotel elevators didn't seem to be working one of the days during our visit, but that was just a minor inconvenience.Overall, we had an excellent stay at the Monaco."
"We found the Kimpton chain last year in Cambridge, Mass. and fell in love. Love the boutiquey feel of the living room (Lobby) and the rooms are super clean and extremely comfy beds. The robes and Aveeda products are a nice touch as well. Do NOT hesitate staying here.....free hotel bikes to cruise the neighborhood and the staff is friendly and anxious to help....cocktail hr. and the ability to bring your dog (we did not) and there is NO scent of doggie anywhere. Shower pressure on 4th floor is weak!!!"
"First of all, the service at this hotel is exceptional. I travel often for work and fairly often for leisure. The staff at this hotel is in my Top 3 experiences. Each and every single staff member we interacted with was helpful and so courteous. I'd truly choose to stay here again based on the service! The location of the hotel is excellent. Within walking distance to many things. We even walked to the Gold Coast and Old Town from the hotel. We were on the 12th floor and the noise of the city was muted considerably. The room was well appointed. Beds and linens comfortable. The robes provided were lush. Towels were soft and still absorbent. The window ledge sitting areas were our favorite part of the room. We used it each afternoon for people and river watching. If sheets would have been provided to put over the cushion, I think my 16 yo would have chosen to sleep there instead of the bed! We did not hear any noise from the adjoining room, even though we know guests were in the room. Hallway noise was minimal also. Room carpeting was clean, along with the bathroom.On Thursday night, the wine reception from 5-6 pm, included live guitar and flute, along with their wonderful wines and Sangria. Friday night, no live music, but still enjoyable with their watermelon Sangria.If returning to Chicago, I would not hesitate to stay at this hotel."
"This is a small hotel next to the Chicago River. Just a couple blocks from the Architecture river boat tours. Walking distance to many restaurants. Walking distance, but a long walk, to Navy Pier. Walking distance to Art Museum and park. Good service, and we had two comfortable queen beds. The free wireless internet service from our room blocked access to our home security system so that was unfortunate. Nice small lobby for relaxing, reading the free newspapers, if your family members are not yet awake. Free coffee/tea there, and spouse enjoyed evening wine party. Had no trouble catching cabs there. Our room did not face street so probably a bit quieter but had ugly view of backs of other buildings. Primary complaint was hearing noise of elevated train nearby but hard to get really quiet room in big city. No refrigerator unfortunately in room. Across the street from a 7 Eleven which was convenient for snacks and supplies."
"The staff at the Hotel Monaco Chicago are great! We like to stay at Kimpton Hotels and the staff at this location were above all the others. With two small children the staff put forth extra effort to make them happy and didn't make us feel like the plague victims that should be hidden from the regular guests. The room was typical of a Kimpton, plush but not extravagant, and the location is perfect. A few blocks from the L, river, and Michigan Ave we could easily get to the major attractions by walking, public transit, or water taxi. The attached South Water Restaurant is good and has an equal staff, with decent, if pricey, food and a good selection of local brew on draft. We enjoyed the stay and will certainly stay here again for our next Chicago visit."
"Stayed one night here on business - experienced the usual top-notch sincere service that Kimptons provide. Check-in was a breeze, for some reason (no idea why) they upgraded me to a 2-room suite, which was really fabulous...the windows in the rooms have these platforms in them with pillows and mattresses - sort of little daybeds, unique and fun.Had beers and appetizers in the downstairs bar - great stuff - duck jerkey, mushroom flatbread, olive plate.I'll be back here on vacation!"
"The Hotel Monaco is a wonderful small hotel perfectly situated. The staff was tremendous during our last stay of 4 nights and the concierge (Rich or Rick) was great. Close to everything, No complaints at all. Nightly free wine hour (with good wine) and free internet in your room. Not a lot of space for kids to run around so I probably would not stay there is I had more than one kid - the lobby is small as would be expected in this type of hotel. I did not see many young kids around. Will definitely stay there again.

"Pros - In downtown, Riverview rooms. All tourist points at walkable distance. Sky deck, John Hancock observatory, buckingham fountain, Navy Pier..shopping. Service is excellent. got room on higher flr and river view..rooms were very clean and best. Staff were very good.Free wine hour in evening, though I did not got time to go at that time. received excellent service.Cons - Parking - valet parking - $52 overnight which is quite expensive. Rooms are comparatively small. No swimming pool"
"Stayed here for a couple of nights for business and it was a good experience. Hotel looks a little beat from the outside (the sign is kind of old and no mention of Kimpton!) but once you get inside it feels like a Kimpton hotel. Quick check in and pleasant staff. Room was on the tenth floor and was spacious enough. The best thing about the room was the view - it looked right out on to the river and some of the beautiful buildings in Chicago. Some of my colleagues had no view so you should definitely ask... it was stunning at night. The window was HUGE and had a seat in it that I could lie out on, really lovely.Bathroom was stocked with aveda products (nice touch) and was pretty standard. The bed was a dream to sleep in and I wish I could bring one home!For people staying for longer trips... I think that there was a fridge but you might want to check. There wasn't any drinks station but I did not need that on this trip. The location was excellent for any touring of the city, you are within walking distance of pretty much everything. Ate at the hotel restaraunt for breakfast and it was good... all a la carte, not buffet (although they serve free coffee in the lobby in the mornings). I ate the pancakes and they were good. Definitely recommend for a couples trip/business trip to Chicago.


Room Tip: High rooms, ask for the river view!

Green Features: There were placards in the bathrooms about the towels. Noted."
"The bright colors and eclectic furniture in the lobby are always a welcome site upon checkin. Both check-in and check-out went smoothly. As a Kimpton Intouch Member, I always appreciate the $10 mini bar credit, because you never know when you'll want a snack (the Rusty's potato chips are my favorite). For this one-night visit, I was in a King Deluxe room, not one with a river view. Room 1417 was nicely laid out with the bathroom separated from the sleeping area by a short, wide hall. Internet worked well. TV was a little odd, in that I could not locate the local weather channel or news, so it was just easier to pull up information online. The bed was very comfortable, and the air conditioning worked great. Minor wear and tear was visible, such as on the wooden soap dish and a small area where the carpet was coming unraveled by one of the walls. These were very minor wear and tear items, and I do plan to stay here again. The hotel is well located for shopping on Michigan Avenue (a short walk away) and visiting tourist attractions such as Millennium Park. To get to the hotel from O'Hare, take the Blue Line to the Clark/Lake stop. The hotel is a short walk away (about 3 blocks)."
"The Hotel Monaco in Chicago was very nice - great location downtown in the theater district with friendly staff. The room was clean, and a nice size. The room has a nice big window seat that overlooked the street which was unique. The bed was very comfortable. I appreciate the yoga mats in the Klimpton Hotels, and along with a yoga menu item on the television, it is easy to relax. I also appreciated that there was a lighted magnifying mirror in the bathroom. There are no coffee makers in the rooms, however a coffee and tea bar is provided in the morning with Starbucks and various teas. In addition there is a wine bar in the lobby in the evenings, and many people were enjoying the wine. The hotel also has bikes that may be borrowed for riding to the parks, etc. There is a restaurant on site which I did not try, however, if I go back I will be sure to eat there - the menu looked quite good. Overall, I would recommend this hotel in downtown Chicago and hope to be back."
"I spent a warm summer afternoon and night here. The location was terrific, right next to the Chicago Tribune building. The food festival was going on around the corner, and in the morning it was just a couple of blocks before I was running along the waterfront, through Grant and Millennium parks and up to the planetarium. The suite was really nice with window seats my kids would have loved. The staff was warm and friendly. Altogether, a very Kimpton experience."
"I spent 3 nights at the Hotel Monaco with my husband and 5-year-old daughter. We were upgraded to an absolutely gorgeous river view suite! My daughter loved the deep window seats and the goldfish that the front desk had sent up to our room. All the staff were very friendly and helpful, and all the facilities were very clean. We loved the location -- easy walking distance to many great restaurants, cafes, and attractions. We will definitely return!"
"Booked thru hotels.com during a busy weekend in Chicago, so paid 359 p/n for Monaco, a nice 4-star boutique hotel (in some cities this would be a 3 or 3.5; in Paris, it's a 3.) nevertheless, nice property, beautiful, brand-new rooms, nice amenities, room was fully- stocked and prepared, and the staff was top-notch. Bed was good, but not as comfortable as the Drake two nights earlier. Stayed in Palomar Dallas (another kimpton boutique) a month ago - same bed. Meh...My one qualm, which I am disappointed about: kimpton's unique value proposition is ""we will have everything you need (such as hair dryer, contact solution, cell phone charger, curling iron, hair spray, nail clippers, you name or) OR we'll get it for you"".During my recent Dallas stay, we called down inquiring for a micro-USB charger or charger cable (for an android phone or blackberry) most common charger in world). We're told at 1am that they don't have one, and can't get one, but we could walk across the highway to the drug store and probably buy one. They alsoDidn't provide toiletries in room, or a 2nd robe (see my other review).During this trip to hotel Monaco Chicago, called down at 1am for some contact solution. Was told they ""just ran out, sorry"". I further inquired about the ""if we don't have it, we'll go get it"" policy, and was told ""sorry but you can go across the street to 7-Eleven ad get some."" I asked twice more ""but what about the ""we'll get it for you policy"", to which the response twice more was the same. Finally, she said ""do you want us to get it for you?"" Ummm, Yes! That was the point. In fairness, Maybe I have just had poor luck and generally the hotels will call the promised ""extras"" and/or get them. But thus far, my experience is kimpton being 0/2. In all fairness and completeness, the property is very nice, extremely clean and brand-new, and tremendous location in the heart of Chicago. Recommended A-."
"Upon arrival, the lobby was very nice and clean. Our room was a bit dusty.  There was a thick line of dust at the top of the headboard. We opted to upgrade, although not realizing that the upgrade would make us from 2 queens to 1 king and a sofa bed!

The food was very good and the service spectacular.

"We stayed at this property from Thursday to Sunday. The hotel is very nice. The Cafe Architect and Le Bar are really nice and the staff are wonderful. Bernard the concierge was exceptional in helping us with car service. The only issue we had was we booked through Booking.com way in advance and when we checked in they gave us a handicapped room. We called down to the front desk and spoke with Michael and told him we did not want a handicapped room and he told us he didn't know which rooms were and were not that way. We found that hard to believe. We were moved to another room but it was also fitted for a person with needs. The bellman told us all the rooms that ended in a particular number were fitted that way. Not sure why we were given a room that someone with needs might need, was it because we used a discounter? We travel a lot and have never encounter this one before. Not sure if we will use this hotel chain again. Never had this issue at any of the other high end hotels."
"We had a very relaxing stay and found the room to be very comfortable. The hotel is very well located and the overall design of the hotel is very tasteful. The staff are very friendly and helpful, and we were able to check in early with no extra fee.


Room Tip: Best to get an upgrade and to choose a room on a higher floor.

The breakfast in the lobby restaurant was amazing and the croissants were as good as those in France. My daughter flew in from Paris and said the same thing. I also had to use the laundry service and that was taken care of and very timely. I loved this hotel and would highly recommend it and I will stay there again!!!

"We have stayed at the Sofitel in Montreal, as well as this one in Chicago and loved them both. I was immediately struck by the numerous and beautiful bouquets of flowers in the lobby. They changed every two or three days and were all stunning. We loved the ceiling to floor windows. As we were on the last stop of our honeymoon, arriving back from Aruba en route for Canada, we stayed three nights here. The beds were incredibly comfortable. Bathrooms very contemporary. There was chocolate covered strawberries and a large bottle of Evian Water along with a congratulatory note waiting for us in the room when we checked in. We had breakfast downstairs in the restaurant and the food was lovely. Great location, close to metro, shopping and walking to some sights. Very good restaurants close by. Service was impeccable. Concierge trip planning services for tours, activities, dinner reservations, etc was very helpful. Architectural boat tour was the highlight of my trip to chicago both times I have visited. We hope to return to the Sofitel."
"We decided last minute to go have some fun in the city and found a great deal online. Everything went very smoothly for our entire trip. The staff was excellent, knowledgeable and friendly. The room was beautiful and the bed was amazing! Loved the tile bathroom and glass shower, too! Le Bar was very cozy for a drink before we headed out to dinner. Our bartender was quite nice to talk too and even gave a suggestion for somewhere else to have a drink near where we were going for dinner. We decided to relax and have room service the next day which was quite tasty! The service was very quick and they thought of everything. Even a lovely orchid bloom to decorate our table! The valet staff were extremely helpful with getting our bags and with taxis during our stay."
"We were really happy with our stay at the Sofitel--staff were friendly, the lobby smelled good, clean and it's in prime location. Very close to the Hancock Observatory and shopping. I think the rooms and furniture need updating but the bed was comfortable but loved the bathroom--roomy, clean, small tub though. Free wifi is always a bonus too.I reserved the room on hotels.com but was not satisfied with extra charges that they charged me. When I called the hotel they said they charged extra $125 or $175 for incidental charges per night and will be refunded after a few days. I've never heard that before! I would have given them 4 stars but the fact that they did not notify me about these charges when I checked in kind of annoyed me."
"Just far enough from Michigan Avenue to avoid the nightly sirens and the constant hum of automobile engines but close enough that a three minute walk has you just steps away from upscale shopping. We loved the hotel from the cosy checkin area to the wonderfully appointed bathroom and guest room. Chicago's famous pizza was just steps away as was one of favorite restaurants, RL's. The complimentary Evian water was a nice touch and cabs were readily available. A great weekend indeed!"
"From the time we exited the cab on Thursday until we went back on Monday, the service was impeccable and not ""fawning"", needs were anticipated, especially in the care of an elderly cousin who was joining us for a wedding, to fine food both at the bar and restaurant.We were there for a wedding and managed to get in trips to the Art Institute and a Hop On/Hop Off tour of the city. Rooms are well appointed and clean, clean, clean. Will come back in a minute.

"I have stayed in at least 15 different hotels in downtown Chicago.This Sofitel may be my new favorite. The location of this hotel is perfect. Close enough to the hustle & bustle of Michigan Avenue but far enough away where you can still find some peace & quiet.I was upgraded to a room on the 24th floor, facing the John Hancock building. That was much appreciated. The amenities were great. Nice sized room, comfortable bed, very large bathroom with nice granite shower (I always appreciate the shower versus the tub shower).I have already booked this hotel for my next visit to Chicago.

The first thing I noticed was the lovely fragrance in the lobby, delightful without being too flowery and overpowering. All of the staff we encountered were very nice from checkin,valet parking, bellhops and the conceirge staff. We were celebrating a milestone birthday and I had noted it as such in my reservation comments. Upon return from dinner our first night there was a bottle of still water, dessert and a note with birthday wishes. A very nice touch. Our room was well apointed, the beds luxurious. We had a king luxury room on the upper floors and the view was lovely. The hotel is in easy walking distance to Michigan avenue. I will definately be back."
"Stayed at the Sofitel Chicago Water Tower the weekend of Oct 31, 2014. I am in Chicago several times a year and like to try different hotels. The Sofitel was extremely nice. Check-in was quick and easy. The Sofitel representative at check-in was very nice, personally greeting me. A nice touch was that she walked around the counter to personally hand me my room key and talk about the hotel. The bellman led me to the room, never turning his back to me, and pointing out various features of the hotel. The room was spacious by Chicago standards and very clean. Outstanding bathroom, large with a tub and a separate marble/glass shower. Bed was ok, comfortable, but my side seemed to sag.The bar is very nice. The waitress was exceptional, and remembered our names the second time we went in there. Drinks were expertly crafted. Nice atmosphere for enjoying the company you are with and for people watching along Wabash / Rush street.Ate breakfast at the restaurant one morning. Was not overly impressed. Standard breakfast fare and prices expected for an upscale hotel. Service seemed disorganized and spotty. They offer a free French pastry and coffee.Only complaint is with the valet prices. $65.00 per night, which is on the very high end for Chicago hotels. If you are familiar with the area, you can find self-parking a few blocks away for $40.00 per night. Basic WiFi is free which is a plus.Bottom line - nice upscale hotel close to major restaurants, bars, and shopping. I would definitely recommend. The price was on par with other hotels in the area. The personal touch at check-in, room cleanliness, and the bathroom set this apart from the other hotels.

"I go to Chicago a few times a year for business, and I usually stay at the Waldorf Astoria Hotel just off Michigan Ave on Walton St. This time I decided to try the Sofitel because it is in the same neighborhood. Although the Sofitel is very nice, I still prefer the Waldorf.The Sofitel architecture and decor are stylish and modern. My suite was very well-maintained, the food in the restaurant was quite good, and the bar area was lively. The bed had a feather mattress topper and was very comfortable. Service throughout the hotel was excellent.Shortcomings of the hotel were minor. My suite was a little small, at least by American standards. Closet space was very small. The bathroom was nicely done in marble, but was also on the small side and had only one sink. The thermostats in each of the two rooms were not placed in the best locations to make the temperature comfortable.I prefer the junior suite at the Waldorf rather than this full suite at the Sofitel because the Waldorf room is about the same size but lower-cost, feels a little more luxurious, has a fireplace, and has a larger bathroom with two sinks and a great, oversized soaking tub."
"As you would expect from a Sofitel, the check in experience is quick and courteous. The rooms are spacious and comfortable. I do note though there could be more international power points and power points in general by the bed. The bathroom is lovely and the toiletries are quality.I wouldn't call the location 'in the centre of it all' but it's got some good restaurants nearby..Service at the cafe downstairs again is attentive and courteous albeit a bit rushed if you are there for peak hour breakfast.The parking though is expensive, I think and somewhat inconvenient.

"I've stayed at the Conrad before when coming to Chicago, and honestly, probably will again. The Sofitel is a great property in an outstanding location, but the Conrad is similarly (if not lower) priced and actually has a more luxurious feel, with newer amenities and larger rooms. I must caution anyone staying here - the beds are HORRIBLE. One thing that does help is the service. The service at most Sofitels, including the one is Chicago is excellent. Restaurant and bar here are very good as well. I would say if you can't afford the Park Hyatt or Penninsula, and the Conrad is sold out, this is your next best bet!"
"Located in a really great and convenient part of the city. It is a modern hotel, very comfortable and my room had a great view over the city. Staff were very efficient, friendly and helpful. There was always a good buzz and people around the hotel and it makes a perfect location for a short city stay with most things within walking distance. A little pricey but overall good value.

"My first time in Chicago, and I can't imagine a better place to make as a base for exploring this great city. We were upgraded to a mini-suite, with floor-to-ceiling windows, a great sitting area, a huge and wonderful bathroom (one of the best I have ever seen), a bed with cosy, comfy linens, pillows, and duvet that made it hard to get going in the morning. The French pedigree of this chain is in evidence from the smart, stylish decor in the room and the common areas (including a breakfast room full of natural light and great waiters - our favourite was Andrey from Ukraine), and the pastries that were the best I've had outside of Paris. The concierge desk was staffed by elegant, incredibly helpful people. And we could walk everywhere from this hotel. Do take an architectural boat tour first thing upon arriving - from then on, you'll notice the great architecture and some of the great buildings that you saw, and you'll appreciate Chicago even more.

"We spent a long weekend at the hotel and were excited to return as we had a good experience there in the past. The service was less than expected this stay. On Saturday morning 2 servers were taking care of a full dining room, so it was almost impossible to catch our waiter's attention to let him know the coffee was delivered lukewarm. After a long day out of the room (9:00 am-3:00 pm) we returned to find the room had not been cleaned. It was finally done after we departed for the evening at 5:00 p.m. The staff are pleasant, and concentrate on offering ""bon jours"" at all times of the day and night but appear understaffed. The prices at this hotel should guarantee a more pleasant experience. Also, make sure you don't have a room near the housekeepers closet. It is not a quiet area."

The Sofitel is a couple blocks off Michigan, the north end of the Magnificent Mile.We have found it fairly convenient during our trips to Chicago.Wifi is available at slightly faster than a snails pace for free, it'll take care of basic email More money if you want some speed. They do have free access to a MAC and PC in the business center. Rooms:Reasonable size, ours had a great view of the Lake Michigan and the Water Tower. We found the room clean, comfortable, quiet, adequately sized, and comfortable. The bed was excellent. I slept like a rock.My one gripe was with valet parking. I've never been a fan of hidden costs, of gotcha fees. We drove in from out of state. I used to live in Boston so high parking costs Im familiar with, but 63 dollars PER night for parking ? Really? For that price I should have gotten a wash and a wax!! food: Walking distance to some great restaurants. I was very disappointed with cafe des architects on our stay. See my other review. I'd AVOID the COMBO bed and breakfast.Verdict:We may return, the hotel itself is excellent and convenient and cheaper than Trump or the 4 Seasons. Cafe des architects their main restaurant had some issues. You get gouged on parking/valet."
"I was at the hotel for an event in the city at the end of June/early July. The service in the restaurant, the cafe/bar outside and by hotel staff was excellent. My travelling party included 3 adults and an adorable little pooch (Grace!). No small feat when toting a shih tzu and puching a wheelchair etc.. The room was more than ample (roomy) with a fantastic view. We have occasionally found the quarters to be extremely confining at other loactions for the chair and crate. I'd strongly recommend staying at this hotel if palnning a trip to Chicago. I did use Expedia and may have rec'd a good price. Based on the courteousness of the staff I experienced, I am sure they will work with interested parties as best they can. The only downside was that there was street construction going on near the outdoor cafe/restaurant. I don't know that can be helped ""in sseason"" in Chicago."
"This hotel was excellent for our weekend trip to Chicago. The staff at the hotel was very friendly and helpful, the modern decoration was great and the bedroom view was very nice. This hotel is very modern, and when compared to other not so new hotels, the rooms and the bathroom have enough space and amenities. The location was perfect, just two blocks away from Magnificent mile, the red line, and just on Rush street. Perfect!

"....offers to send up wine glasses with the corkscrew you requested, but first asks you ""What type of wine did you bring, so we may send up the right type of wine glass?"" This is still one of the best hotels out there. Fantastic value. Fantastic staff. Fantastic location. They upgraded us to a suite since they noticed it was my first time coming for fun.. (normally I am there for work). No matter who is paying -- you or your company -- it's a great value.


Room Tip: Higher floors are best.. but elevators get busy at times.

"I visited Chicago to attend wedding ceremony of my friends on 2nd of August.During that period, I chose Sofitel water tower of Chicago, and that was very satisfactory. The location is very good to get in downtown and the room is nice and clean.After my friend's wedding ceremony, we had dance party on the 2nd floor of Sofitel reception area. DJ was good,also fine music. Overally this is very nice hotel when you visit Chicago."
"We stayed here four nights on our trip, the room did not disappoint as it was up to the usual high standards we have experienced in other Sofitels before. Everything was very clean and looked pretty new, the bed was exceptionally comfortable and the room dead quiet at night. The only negative was a lack of coffee in the room, which meant you had to go downstairs to the restaurant to get free coffee (and pastries if you could make it down before 7am!). I'm not sure the staff need to greet everyone with 'bonjour' either as it seemed a bit gimmicky by the fourth day, but other than that it's a fine place to stay."
"Excellent impressive foyer, and great welcoming check in.
Concierge very knowledgeable and helpful.
Room finished to a very high standard, spacious and well equipped.
Location excellent in terms of access to local transport, bars, restaurants and shopping.
Nice bar and restaurant section with a wide range,

"We have stayed at the Sofitel in 5 separate stays in the past 3 years and we love it. The rooms are extremely comfortable and unique/cool looking. The location is perfect (10 mins from the 'beach' on a nice Chicago afternoon). The staff is very elegant and friendly. We absolutely refuse to stay somewhere else when we are in town, and note that it can often offer a much better value for your dollar than other places based on our research of alternatives."
"For our two-night August stay, we booked a Prestige Suite under their Family package and were thrilled at the value we received. My husband and I had two 9-year-old girls with us, and the location made it easy for us to take them on evening walks to Ghirardelli and then around the neighborhood to burn off some energy! (Warning: it is a mere two blocks from the American Girl store). Navy Pier is a fairly easy walk, as is Oak Street beach. The hotel's public spaces are beautiful--it's great to stay in a place that has a polished, adult-friendly feel that also takes such good care of kids. Our corner room on the 20th floor gave us a fantastic view, and having two sets of doors between the bedroom and the living area allowed my husband and I to kick back in peace, and let the girls giggle into the night. The bed was incredibly comfortable--it envelopes you in down splendor that will make it hard to leave it in the morning. Even the girls' sofa sleeper was more comfy than their own beds at home, with a feather bed and down duvet. The Hermes bath amenities were some of the best we've come across.The staff welcomed us warmly and did a fine job of taking care of our room and needs throughout the stay. The welcome gifts for the girls was superb: the bags (to tote their AG dolls around town in) filled with sunglasses and other goodies made them feel special. We will most definitely return to the Sofitel--with kids or for a quick weekend for the two of us.

"My wife and I spent a few days in Chicago for some site seeing and shopping. We really enjoyed our stay at the Sofitel. Our room was clean, comfortable and the service was great. We had a nice view of the John Hancock tower and city from our room. I called room service for a corkscrew and wine glasses and they were delivered extremely quickly. We loved the neighborhood around the hotel. It was very quiet and down the street there were some great restaurants and shops. There were always plenty of cabs right out front and the staff were always friendly and accommodating when we needed something. The room has a mini bar but a small refrigerator was delivered on request so we could keep water and leftover meals cold. There is a nice little outside seating area with bar service right out front which we enjoyed. We would definitely stay here again."
"Have stayed here a couple of times. It's a wonderful hotel. It's a little hard to find it your walking, but most people would be in a cab. Wonderful views of the Navy Pier, and Millenium Park.Good clean rooms, good location, but most of all the views from the higher floors are unbelievable. We were fortunate enough to stay in a suite on the 33rd floor with floor to ceiling windows. One of my best hotel memories ever.

"I spent 4 nights at the Sofitel Water Tower Chicago. Just about everything about the stay was great. The staff was courteous, professional and extremely helpful and friendly. Room was quite deluxe. 4 stars because the bed wasn't quite up to what I expected. Nothing really terrible-just not quite like the Westin beds. I didn't eat in the restaurants so I can't comment on the food. The location was extremely convenient-just 2 short blocks off Michigan Ave. Concierge was super helpful. I'd stay there again.

"Well located and opposite two good restaurants, this is a great place to stay if you like a modern hotel. It has very nice staff and comfortable rooms. We could not fault anything. We were on the 31st floor which was quiet and had good views. There are four lifts which are so efficient that the wait was minimal. The glass clad building is something of a landmark with its unusual triangular tapering design. Internally this means that the floors have an intimacy that other large hotels do not. The breakfast restaurant was always busy but the staff coped well and the food was good if a little expensive. The concierge service was exceptional with pleasant and knowledgeable staff. We had a problem with a tour booking that our travel agent had made and it was all sorted out for us efficiently.


Room Tip: The higher the floor, the better the view. Avoid rooms near the ice machines.

"Not only is the hotel lovely but the staff is exceptional! I lost my credit card and my bank was expressing it to Chicago, but my time line was very tight because I was leaving on a Lake Michigan cruise. Peter, the concierge, called me after I checked out and expedited my getting the card, which was very much appreciated. Sofitel is in a wonderful location and very quiet, despite construction across the street. My only complaint - bed was softer than I prefer."
"We're here for 2 nights and first night was fine as we checked in late. however, the second night was brutal as my wife's dust allergy triggered and all out plans got stalled. The room service was covered in dust and upon complaining we're given all sorts of lame excuses by the hotel manager and when all those excuses were debunked, she started apologising and offered complimentary breakfast if we stayed one more night on our own expense. Really? I was not ready to pay $300 for staying another day for the their fault. And now the negotiation started - first pay 50% and the pay 25% of that day's tariff...really??? Is that what's expected from a world class hotel? I felt like I was speaking to someone in a shady motel and negotiating for a deal...and upon mentioning that I will be sharing this my experience online....I was advised by her that threatening her won't help. Is sharing your experience online with others the same thing as threatening someone? Based on this experience, I decided to pay more and stay elsewhere than stay at this hotel for the third. At checkout, I was asked by the gentleman there whether i needed any help. And, upon narrating my sour experience to him, all I heard was an apology after each line of my narration.I would never ever stay nor recommend anyone to stay at this hotel in unless you want to experience customer service equivalent to cheap 3rd class service expected from a cheap budget hotel/ motel, and hear only apologies for their mistakes and no proper action is taken for their mistakes."
"Business meeting at upscale hotels has been a thing much missed, but the Sofitel was a great way to see chicago. Corner rooms looking at the navy pier and the miracle mile, large rooms surrounded by glass were a de stressor from the start. Elevators respond by pushing the floor at the call point, it inside the elevator, so waits are kept,to a minimum, and there is no miltiplemstoosmifmyounaee on a high floor. Bathrooms had separate shower and tub, and large sink area and counter, in room lights closet, safe, and comfortable bed, recliner, couch let you spread out, and the work desk was large w close plug ins. The was an inner hallway from the outside, keeping hall noise to a minimum, but I did need my white noise machine for the street noise. Staff was friendly and helpful, and the turndown service left Swiss chocolates on the pillow.Comfortable bed and pillows, Gym was large and well supplied. Meeting rooms were large and quiet. Food was a let down as the. Edge tables were all overlooked, but the other items were cooked better, and even the oatmeal,for breakfast was well made.Would enjoy staying here again.

"We have discovered Chicago after a long trip across America. We booked at Sofitel without knowing where it was in town. Finally it was a good choice as it is very central, 2 mn walk to Michigan avenue, and easy to get on the right road to the airport on final day. Sofitel is Sofitel = quality.End of July may not be the best period to get a good deal but it was worth paying for quality and location. Public Parking next door at 45$/ day. Bed was too soft for me but my wife enjoyed it so...Staff at the counter was nice and very helpful.

"Stayed for a weekend in March. The location is top notch, bars and restaurants all nearby as well as the Magnificent Mile. The hotel is very unique, stylish and holds its own in the architectural wonder of Chicago and competing hotels. Check in was smooth and staff were very friendly, professional and helpful. The room was excellent...very stylish, all the amenities and very comfy bed. We chose a ""high floor"" room and had a stunning view of the Chicago skyline and Hancock Tower. We ate breakfast at the hotel restaurant one morning...if you can, treat yourself to that. Fresh complimentary pastries were offered at the start of our meal and the breakfast we ordered was superb, with attentive service. A great experience overall, it was a treat in all respects!"
"Sofitel is a French chain and it never forgets that! The lobby, the flowers, the food, the amenities, the room decor - all the best of today's Paris! We experienced an unfortunate hiccup with our reservation but the front desk staff was quick to remedy it with an amazing upgrade. The location is excellent - just a couple of blocks off Michigan (the Magnificent Mile) and the Hancock Tower - but even more importantly, just a couple of blocks from Oak Street where the miracles really happen: Prada, Louboutin, Hermes, Saint Laurent, Chanel, Jimmy Choo .... I have to say we only ate breakfast at the hotel but the menu was varied and the food more than enough to see you through to a late lunch.Trust Peter, the concierge - he is a genius with a terrific sense of humour! He more than made up for a couple of the front desk staff who could have have used a bit more training in the hotel systems and policies.In all, a very good stay!


Room Tip: Suites above the 22nd floor have great views; below that, not so much!

"This was the fourth time that I have stayed here, and it has become my ""go to"" Chicago Hotel. It is not located in the heart of the downtown commercial district, but it is close enough, and a short taxi ride. The hotel is amazingly good value, with everything clean, and new and well buffed. The rooms are a good size and extremely well appointed and well maintained. I had forgotten my toothbrush, and room service had a complimentary one sent up to the room within 5 minutes. The whole staff are there to serve, and try hard. I enjoy the ""bonjour"" and ""bon soir"" stuff with which all the staff greet the guests. Sure, it could be a bit hokey I suppose, but I travel so much, and enjoy a hotel with its own identity. There is a Starbucks just around the corner, if you, like me, prefer to spend $7 on breakfast, and not fork out for a hotel breakfast. The only downside is that the gym is tiny, and very short on strength training equipment and space to use it.


Green Features: The usual stuff - hang your towels up and they will not replace them."
"We recently stayed at the Sofitel Chicago on 7/12/14 for a bachelorette party.The suite we stayed in was decadent yet comfortable.

Personally, Personally, I found it expensive but then our currency is poor versus the Dollar exchange rate. Service was excellent especially in the restaurant and the help we received with getting 3 very heavy suitcases to our room was really appreciated. It seemed to be very busy with large numbers of conference delegates as Chicago was hosting two large events during the week of our stay, 19 to 23 May. Overall a very satisfactory experience.

"I have stayed at this hotel several times now and keep returning when I visit Chicago. The location is great as it's so close to Old Town, one of my favorite areas. There is great shopping (walking distance) and are great restaurants (walking and driving) nearby. The service in every department is excellent. Honestly though, the food at Sofitel is great so if you are very busy and don't have time to plan dinners that's OK. My husband and I really like their Sunday brunch. Service in the bar is great too, and room service is quick. My room has always been spotlessly clean. The bed, pillows, and bedding are all very comfortable and there are always plenty of towels. The front desk is quick and efficient."
"My first stay was in June 2012. I was impressed with everything. Normally, I would look for a restaurant outside a hotel, but I arrived late and decided to try the hotel's restaurant. I'm glad I did as my dinner was first rate. I told our hotel administrator that we should start using the Sofitel for meeting and we have. My colleagues and the executives at our meetings really like the hotel as well. Nothing is cookie cutter here as the rooms are nicely laid out. There is a definite French accent floating around the entire hotel, creating a nice atmosphere. The location is convenient and in a very desirable part of town. Finally, the staff has always been helpful. I have been back several times since my first visit and I look forward to returning."
"Whenever I am in Chicago on business I plan my stay to include the Sofitel. As soon as the cab door is opened by the ever present doorman, I am welcomed in a warm and friendly manner. Once in the lobby, I am pleasantly greeted by the personnel at the registration desk where I am quickly and professionally registered. Since I frequent this wonderful hotel, I am greeted like an old friend returning to visit which is wonderful when traveling for business. Makes for an extremely nice welcome! The rooms are beautiful, clean, bright and very well appointed. The restaurant is perfect for breakfast, lunch and they have a wonderful gourmet dinner menu. The bar has some great choices of wine (as well as many other beverages) and the small plates they serve in the bar/lounge area are all delicious. I LOVE this place!


Room Tip: Hard to say - ALL the rooms are very comfortable and most look out onto a beautiful view. Obviously...

"I stayed at the Sofitel for 5 nights to attend a conference. It is very well located near Michigan Avenue with all its excellent shopping, and close to very good restaurants and has easy access to public transport. It is in a quite street. The building is very attractive modern architecture and has a bright large lobby. Checkin was rapid with very pleasant efficient staff. My room was on the 26th floor with great views of the city. There are plenty of elevators so it was never a problem to wait for an elevator. The room was large and very well furnished. There is excellent storage for clothes and a large safe which swallows laptops and other valuables. The bathroom is also large and supplied with all you could need - and has a separate shower cubicle which is great. The desk is large and there is a thoughtful socket adaptor for European and UK plugs. The bed is extremely comfortable with a variety of pillows to choose from. The curtains provide excellent blackout. Anyone should be able to sleep very well here! My only niggles were that there is no coffee provision in the room (extremely unusual for US hotels) which is something you really miss if flying in from a long way away and the queues for breakfast were often rather slow. Despite these minor caveats, this is a really good hotel and well worth using if you are in Chicago

"I booked a one-night stay at the Mile North earlier this year to take advantage of the prime location. First impressions were very good, I really liked the way the lobby is set up. The Starbucks to the left of the front desk is a great touch! When I made the reservation, I was only able to reserve a room with two beds. When I came to check-in, the amazing front desk staff noticed that it was just me staying with them and they upgraded me to a very nice suite! I thought that was awesome, and quite honestly; I did not expect that. I am not picky and would have been happy with a regular room, but it was really nice to know that the staff pays such close attention to things like that. I wish I remembered their names, but the man and woman at the front desk (as well as the rest of the front office & hotel staff, I'm sure) should be recognized for their extraordinary care to detail and kindness during my stay.The suite in which I stayed was clean and very comfortable. I wish I could have spent more time in it during my stay. I would definitely stay with this property again and look forward to a time in which I can return.

"Stayed her with my sister and her 2 teenagers. The teenagers thought the place was cool- so thats a plus:) My sister and I loved that it was so close to shopping and restaurants. I would stay here again and again. We had dinner at the hotel and was quite impressed, and they made a pretty good moscow mule:) We watched one of the playoff games there on the big screen and the entire lobby was a buzz. Great experience, great room and great views. Thank you to the wonderful staff, they were friendly and personable."
"Being just off Michigan Ave, adjacent to the Northwestern University Hospitals and Medical School, and over-looking Lake Michigan certainly gives this very comfortable and quiet hotel a real advantage. We have stayed here a couple of times and have found the staff very helpful, the rooms clean, and the beds comfortable. My only criticisms are that on both visits, we had a room that had stairs between the bed and the bathroom, a nighttime concern and the fact that the rooms have had only a single chair. Although the rooms are smallish, they certainly could accommodate two places for quests to sit and visit.The breakfast is Spartan but adequate and there are many dining establishments close by."
"I chose Mile north, cause it's got great reviews, it turned out to be a let down.Staff at the front desk who weren't professional, they were too green to tell me if certain services were free or not.I've been to other large cities and stayed at their hotels, this hotel really doesn't live up to my expectation, as a 4 stars hotel which is located in the center of Chicago, it's hard to believe that they don't have a scale for travelers to weigh their luggages. One of the employee kept telling people who checked in to go to the bar in the hotel, well there was a flyer and a sign which mentioned it closed on weekend, I heard a guy asked the staff about it, he said' I wasn't aware it didn't open on weekend.'Tripadvisor indicated that it had shuttle bus, it wasn't true, they could arrange it for me, which means I have to pay.I intended to check in earlier, thankfully I looked it up before going there, they charge for early check in. I asked if I could check out a bit later the next day, they told me that they would charge me automatically! There's a surcharge for WIFI on my room, course I didn't turn mine on. I thought I didn't give them any reason to charge me any additional fee, ironically I needed to pay like 7 bucks for service fee, I really don't get what kind of services they provided me, really.They apparently use every single excuse to ask for money.I highly recommend people NOT to book Mile north, it's overpriced with lousy services, period!"
"Just got back from Chicago and had stayed in 3 different hotels along the way. Mile North was the last one on our trip,Pros- I loved the feel of the hotel, The young man checking us in was very polite and nice along with all the bell men who were very help full and friendly. We had 2 rooms both on the same floor 22 and both had great views. The rooms were very spacious and I loved that as you walked in you had to step down into the bedroom. The beds were super comfy and lovely linens.The Cons- We had travelled a lot on this trip and we were looking forward to ""laying in"" on our day of check out. Well it started very early in the morning with the maid knocking and shouting house keeping every 5 minutes, I am not sure what time it was but I am sure it was before 9am after she tried to open the door twice I thought she would have got the message that we were still in the room. I went down to get a drink and when I came back the maid was in one of the rooms cleaning, I started talking to the guest in that room who was sitting on the bed and the maid basically ""shooed"" us out the room. We went across to the other room and I tried to explain to her that I was under the understanding that check out was 11am and it was still only 10am well that did not matter. She started to wheel the vacum into the 2nd room!!!!! So I told her to please wait so at least we could get out the room. When we gave up and left the room I came down to the front desk to re confirm check out time and to explain what happened I was merely told ""well I should have put the do not disturb sign on the door"" As I explained there was not one in the room or I would have done that from the night before. An apology would have been nice but I got the impression the woman behind the desk really did not care one bit. Maybe Mile North should advise their cleaning staff that on the day people are checking out to be mind full what time check out is and make sure ""do not disturb"" signs are in all their rooms.Having said that I really liked this hotel a lot the location was Perfect, the room very comfortable and the cafe downstairs was great to get a hot breakfast egg, sausage and bacon for $7 was just what we needed to re group after being pushed out the room LOL. Will definitely be returning to Chicago and I would stay here again for sure."
"My husband and I overall enjoyed our stay. We asked for a view of the city, but were told we would enjoy the size of our room even more.Our room was large. We figured out after some inspection that it was the ADA compliant room. That's fine, still wish we had had a better view.It was immaculate. The bed was super comfortable.The location of the hotel is perfect, we spent a lot of time strolling up and down Michigan Avenue and it was an easy walk to our various destinations throughout our trip.The lobby decor is very cute. We spent some time just hanging out down there reading and enjoying a beverage.After prepaying online and being told at check-in that we needed to provide a credit card only for incidentals, we were dismayed to be stuck with hotel service fees of $20. We paid it, but whaaaaat? Like I said before, we really enjoyed our stay. Just a couple of things..."
"The location and lobby were promising and 1 of the females working at the desk when we arrived was at least friendly while ""Jessica"" twirled her hair and ignored the fact that her co-worker (Cynthia) was struggling with a computer issue. We were traveling with our dog so we were given a ""pet friendly"" room with the nastiest faded & smelly carpet! UGH! But the gross carpet was NOTHING compared with the unprofessional, rude and disrespectful treatment my husband received on a phone interaction with Jessica over the huge price difference in added charges for a pet the hotel charged at check-in as opposed to the price advertised on a pet-friendly hotel finder site. The issue was eventually resolved the next day by a Manager but it ruined our evening and left us with a very negative impression of this hotel. When people ask me for a hotel recommendation in Chicago I will tell them to skip this place! Ain't nobody got time for THAT!"
"Nice hotel. Sitting areas in lobby. Cafe/bar located there. Decent sized room. Downside, is there aren't any vending machines, so plan accordingly. We did have a fridge in room. Parking is valet, and is $62 a night. We parked a few blocks away, but still paid $44. There is a rooftop bar called 52 Eighty. Smaller than anticipated. Outdoor area wasn't opened yet. Location is what makes this hotel."
"We arrived early and the room was ready. It was very nicely decorated and clean. The lobby was also clean and nicely decorated - modern. We were on the 7th floor. It was quiet and we liked the view from our window. Would ask for same room next visit! Pillows were real nice after walking all day in Chicago.The bathroom was very clean, shampoo, soap was real nice, and the shower was huge.This hotel is next to Ginos pizza, which was excellent.

"I booked this hotel on a ""bait and switch"" deal that Hotwire offered in it's ""Secret Hot Rate Hotel"" category. After listing four guests for our reservation, Hotwire shows six quality name brand four star hotels then in small print mentions you could also get an independent or boutique hotel. I put two adults and two children in the drop down tabs to make sure we received a room big enough to accomodate my family. After finding out my secret hotel was ""MileNorth,"" I panic and look up reviews for this hotel since I've never heard of it. (I have stayed in Chicago over a dozen times and literally have never seen this hotel.) There were so many issues reviewed that I tried to get my hotel changed to a major chain, since Hotwire declined I decided to take a chance and see for myselft. Upon arrival a very pleasant door man gave me directions on where to park. Milenorth uses a self park lot across the street that is shared with Northwestern Hospital. (24 hours of parking was $53.) We entered the hotel lobby which was clean and very trendy looking. We check in and find out that HOTWIRE guarantees a double occupancy only for the secret hot rate. (Check their website and you won't see any mention of this). Not to worry, Christopher at the desk gladly helps us out and gives us a junior suite on the 8th floor for our trouble. When we get up to our room we are pleasantly surprised that it's nice and clean and has lots of space for our family. The bathroom was clean but dated and there was a slight issue with the lock on our door, which my teenage son was able to take care of. The bed was a lovely soft cloud with a fluffy down comforter that was truely a treat after walking Michigan Avenue all day! The sofa bed was standard and the teenagers were just fine on it. Our T.V. didn't work in our room so the kids used the free wi-fi. When we mentioned to the desk about the T.V. upon check out, they promptly gave us free drink coupons to use that morning. We grabbed a Starbucks on our way out of the hotel with a big smile on our faces. Location: 5 Stars, Room appearance: 4 stars, Staff: 5 stars."
"Veteran Chicago visitor but first time at this hotel. Great location a block East of Michigan Ave in the heart of the Water Tower area. Staff was attentive on checkin. No motor lobby so loading/unloading is a bit of a strain. Particularly so for us with two dogs. We stay at a lot of Kimpton hotels as they all accept pets. The pet fee of $75 per dog is a bit salty at this one though. This was a short stay so did not have the opportunity to take in the amenities of the hotel. Had a cocktail in the inviting lobby bar. generous and well crafted. We rented a king suite which had a nice seating area with additional TV. Bathroom very modern. Lighting very ""W"" style. I would stay here again.


Room Tip: For just a slight upcharge the king suite offered room to spread out

"We stayed 5 nights in March- we were impressed with all elements of the hotel. The room was large and comfortable, staff were excellent (especially Joel) and as mentioned elsewhere, the location was perfect for sightseeing and shopping. Starbucks in the hotel was handy for a quick morning coffee and the bar staff were friendly (as were the front desk). We couldn't fault it at all, and recommend it to anyone staying in Chicago."
"MileNorth is in an amazing location. It is directly beside one of the best rated deep dish pizza places in Chicago - Gino's (be aware if going for pizza that it takes them 45 minutes at least to prepare). The hotel is also just one block off of the Magnificent Mile with loads of upscale shopping available and within short walking distance to the famous Chicago Water Tower. The MileNorth itself is a neat boutique-feel hotel. It offered probably one of the most comfy hotel beds I've ever slept in - with nice plump pillows and a great duvet. I loved the ""green"" option of putting a card on the door stating you didn't require maid service the next day and receiving a $5 credit to use at the on-site small restaurant. The staff was accommodating and friendly. A very pleasant surprise was the wifi that was available free of charge. The only disappointing part was that the bar and restaurant at the top of the building was undergoing renovation and wouldn't be open until the beginning of April. But there were plenty of alternatives available in the neighbourhood including a small lounge area in the lobby that had an awesome flamenco guitarist playing one night. You can tell that there have been a lot of upgrades done to the interior recently to make it up-to-date. I wouldn't hesitate to stay here again the next time I'm in town.

"We stayed here for one night on Saturday, 3/14 and really enjoyed our stay at this great location. The front desk was kind enough to let us check in early, to drop off our bags. The room was clean, updated, and very comfortable. Great bed, comfortable linens. We also enjoyed a nightcap in the lobby and heard a fantastic young man play the heck out of his guitar! Flamenco, I believe. The hotel lobby was very aesthetically appealing and comfortable. I would definitely; stay here again. The only bad thing was that there was alot of noise from 2am - 6am, people partying in the hall, slamming doors, etc....I would have called the desk to complain but kept hoping they would settle do\wn."
"We stayed here for the dying of the river 2015 for 2 night in March. The hotel offered a great location and was literally steps away from Michigan Avenue. The hotel was clean with a modern look. More of a boutique venue as it is not large and generic but rather small, tasteful and comfy. Check in/check out was fast and efficient. The rooms are a fair size for a city hotel. Bedding was white hotel variety but room was clean and tastefully decorated. Fantastic wall paper in both the room and bathroom. The shower offered body scrub shampoo and conditioner dispensed in the shower. Those were the only amenities offered. We did have a fridge but it was never fully engaged even when turning up to coldest. There was an iron and blow dryer, my blow dryer was subpar but did the trick. The bathroom lacks Vents or a fan- this is about the only negative. The entire hotel was overly warm but it is in between season which is a difficult time to monitor temp, one minute you need the air next the heat. Elevators very small and very slow. This May be due to the fact there are too many people for the 2 in operation for floors above 7....5 people max in each or you are touching. Most people opted to wait rather than feel overcrowded. They had a very nice bar/reception/lounge area. This area offered small eats, drinks and coffee. There was a nice acoustic performance on the Saturday we were there. Valet parking is 62.00 but the parking garage is across the street...steps away. For 10.00 per day it is easy to unload and then park yourself for 52.00 and the 52.00 is in line with parking everywhere in the city. The coffee prices were reasonable 2.65 for a large regular. The drinks were comparable to every where else we visited. Mixed drinks about 10.00 each and beer at 6.00 7.00 each. If prices are reasonable compared to other hotels in the area, next time we visit Chicago I will book this place again."
"We spent 3 nights at MileNorth hotel in September 2014. This hotel clearly exceeded our expectations. It's located in the city center, very stylishly designed, with spacious rooms. A separate attraction is a bar on top of the building with great panorama, especially at night. Yet breakfasts were not included.While both check-in and check-out were a bit messy for us, we still give it a 5-star rating thanks to the attitude of a waitress in a roof-bar, who offered a free drink in return for the one I spilled from the table. This is a small thing but it makes a difference."
"I could not have been more pleased with our experience at MNH. We were there for my daughter's wedding and the staff was amazing from reservations to check out! We had to increase the room block several times and always easily and without incident. I might add that Chicago was having a very big convention that weekend and we were still treated like the most important reservations they had. The bell service was like none I have ever experienced. Henry got our large group settled and cars for events so smoothly we felt as though we were VIP's. Il will definitely stay here again when I stay downtown and have recommended it to many people already.


Room Tip: Saw many of the rooms as we were a large party and all were large sunny and quiet.

"This was a Groupon deal. This hotel is very environmentally friendly. Recycled products and the choice to re-use our towels and sheets to decrease our footprint. Our suite was so big and pretty. Two free wi-fi, 2 hd t.v.s, a living room, bedroom, and a huge bathroom. The shower is large and has a water-fall feel to it. Although we couldn't get room service late at night, we called Gino's Pizza across the street to deliver us pizza, sandwiches and pop. Our room had an awesome view of Downtown Chicago. We were close to many stores and restaurants. Our room was quiet, the bed was comfortable, staff was helpful, and we will be going back!


Room Tip: We asked for a room with a view and recieved a great one.

The hotel was bustling with activity...so apparently others know of his greatness as well. This is a modern hotel with all the amenities you could want...including a Starbucks in the lobby! :) Great location with close proximity to Michigan Ave and all the great shopping along with many popular local restaurant favorites. I travel monthly around the country for work and have stayed at many different levels and brands of hotels...you wont regret choosing the MileNorth.
"Just returned from spending the weekend in Chicago. The staff was not only personable but very helpful, especially the front of the house staff. Would like to thank Cynthia and all of the desk staff for taking the time to show us rooms, etc. We had a couple of very small items needing correction in the room and they were attended to immediately. The hotel is in a great location. We look forward to staying at Mile North again in June."
"We came for a hospital visit but did some shopping and eating. Being at the top of michigan avenue makes it perfect for a loop of shopping . Clean modern and very roomy throughout.! . A much better layout than the usual hotel room . I love that the bathroom entry is away from the sleeping area. And theyve done away with the ridiculous bathtub! The bathroom is bigger than the usual. Big enough for two to be in at the same time. The shower is spacious and has a good shower head. Clearly im a bathroom person! But the bedroom is bigger too. A nice big window , lots of light . There arent a lot of services other than a coffee bar and regular bar , but the location is perfect for shopping, eating and i highly reccommend for people visiting the northwestern hospital campus. Love the simple modern feel."

"Well, yes that is possible, but you have to get it yourself as there is NO room service at this hotel. I was disappointed knowing that I couldn't be lazy in my bed and order room service. If you are looking for something to eat from the hotel, you must go to the bar area which is just to the left of the check-in desk and you can order food-to-go from the bar menu and either wait for it downstairs at the bar while it's being prepared or go back upstairs to your room and then someone will call you to come back down, which is a shame, because the rooms are very nice and large, and the bed is oh so comfy!! If i'm in my jammies, I don't want to have to go back downstairs for anything!!"
"The hotel is in a great location, a 1/2 block of the Magnificent Mile. I signed up for a special package that was 40% off their normal rates. When I called direct for reservations I had to direct the reservations person I was talking to their web site, she was not aware of the 40% off rate. I upgraded to a ""City View"". What we got was a view of the parking structure across the street. When I questioned the front desk I was told this was a ""City View"". The staff did not seem very interested in my concern. The room was ok. It was in need of an update. The only chair in the room was the desk chair. There was a little dressing table in the bathroom, my wife appreciated that. The fitness center was well equipped and clean. I will look elsewhere for our March trip to Chicago.

"2 of air conditioner in our room were broken. The Tel was broken also.I had to out of the bed and changed pajama to regular cloth and went down to the reception for explain at the middle of night.My husband were already felt sick by very cold air came from the air conditioner.Even I kept 115 degrees, but it down to 65 degrees immediately.One other air conditioner wasn't turn on not at all.The staff came to our room and checked them and recognized broken.They fund other room with the air conditioner works normally, but they required us if we move we have to move every our staff with us.They had to move to the other room at the middle of the night.Out side was 14 degree, but inside of room was almost same temperature.We were not happy to move to half size of room with moving every cloths, shoes, luggage.The staying of this Hotel was the most miserable experience in my life.Even I'm not happy to leave 1 star."
"Can't wait to go back to Chicago. The sights the people the food! MileNorth is a great hotel. It is just the right size and only a couple of blocks from Magnificent Mile on Michigan Ave. Huge suite with a king size bed and sofa sleeper,living area and desk/office area. Just blocks from Garretts Popcorn and the architectural boat tour. Good walking distance to the water tower and Eataly which is a must see. The hotel has the highest open air rooftop bar with Hancock tower as a fantastic backdrop. If you are looking to do a lot of dining in at your hotel this is not the right choice for you. If you are looking for a clean reasonably priced hotel in an excellent location this is it.


Room Tip: Choose a city view room

"Found great rate of about $110 for a hotel just steps from North Michigan Ave. BUT, overnight valet parking was $60 and we chose it because it was ""pet friendly"", although a non refundable fee of $75 for one night stay doesn't strike me as all that ""friendly. "" All in, with taxes,etc, our one night was closer to $300 than $100. I should've done my homework better, but hoping to save others the trouble. That said, the lobby was very cool and the room was nicely decorated and comfortable. And you cant beat the location. Mixed bag for us."
"Our stay began by being brought to the wrong room but they readily and helpfully moved us to the room we reserved. Once in the new room, it was very clean and everything worked correctly. On the second day, our air conditioner broke and they didn't leave toilet paper. They did fix the issue quickly and we were very thankful. Once they fixed the issue, they did provide us with two complimentary items from the coffee cafe. The hotel is charming and classy with a phenomenal top floor lounge and a cafe on the ground floor with delicious coffee and similar beverages along with tasty food. We cannot wait to return and enjoy another trip in Chicago!

"Let's start with the positives: the rooms are very modern, the bed was very comfortable, and you can't beat the location in the heart of downtown Chicago. But four star hotels are supposed to do more. These are all fairly minor, but they add up. First, the reception clerk was supposed to give me a packet relating to the meeting I was attending the next day. I didn't learn that until I arrived at the meeting and was without it. Apparently other attendees experienced the same thing. Second the bathroom had a dripping faucet, the toilet bowl had hairs on it, the shower curtain rod was partially dislodged such that one couldn't close the curtain all the way, and some of the towels were so old that they were fraying on the edges. Third, the main floor lamp in the room didn't work and the cable box behind the TV had an annoying red blinking light that I had to cover with a towel. Fourth, I ordered a Manhattan at the bar, and the bartender poured a bourbon on the rocks. When I reminded him I wanted a Manhattan, he topped off the glass with a few drops of vermouth, added bitters and a cherry, and handed it back to me! Unreal. Fifth, the WiFi was terrible: I'd say I was only able to connect around 20% of the time."
"This hotel is nicely located close to the Magnificent Mile, but still offers you a peaceful sleep. You have a convenient bar at the lobby, a friendly welcome upon check-in. My reason to stay at the MileNorth was to attend a course at the excellent Kellogg School of Management. In fact, I stayed at this hotel three times. I could choose others nearby, but there was really nothing to make me go elsewhere. Spotless. Beautiful, pleasant rooms."
"My family and I stayed here as my youngest daughter had some testing to do at Lurie Children's and the stay was great. Not only are they located next to the hospital, but this was my daughter's first stay at a hotel. The concierge, Christopher, was very pleasant and even gave us an upgrade for the night being that it was our first time there and we were VIP members. Our room was very clean and the beds were comfy. We will definitely be returning to this location not only because of the service but also the price can't be beat, especially being soo close to the Mag mile. 2 Thumbs up for sure!"
"Loved our stay at the MileNorth. We pricelined the room, so it was the luck of the draw, but we were thrilled. Perfect location near the Miracle Mile. The room was sort of oddly laid out, long and narrow like a bowling alley, but beautifully furnished. The bathroom was painted a gorgeous metallic copper. Room had a great view and was quiet. We loved chatting with the bartender at the rooftop bar, ate at Gino's next door. Everyone we talked with was so friendly, which was something we didn't know about Chicago being first time (southern) visitors. Would definitely return to the MileNorth and to Chicago."
"Stayed at the MileNorth for 3 nights over New Years. I agree with the many TA reviews that the location is perfect. So close to the magnificent mile and all it has to offer. The rooftop bar was also a treat. The rooms are spacious and having the fridge for leftovers is convenient. It was a little disappointing the front desk staff didn't put us in the room I reserved, but things were sorted out quickly. The bathroom is large and my wife really enjoyed the lighting from the lit up mirror while putting on make-up. The shower water pressure is a bit lacking. We had a room on a higher floor and didn't hear a peep the entire time we stayed.The lobby is very warm and welcoming with big comfy couches and chairs. Overall we enjoyed our stay, but I probably would try out a different property when I'm in Chicago next."
This place lived up to my high expectations. The service in all regards was friendly and efficient. The decor is pretty modern but not over the top. The rooms were clean and comfy but most of all quiet! The little restaurant downstairs had the best salad I've had in a while and their flatbread was great! Maybe a little pricey but we weren't even planning on eating so it was a nice surprise. The room rates were very competitive and I booked directly with the hotel! Also... Right next to Gino's so we loved that!
"I stayed in a King Suite for 3 nights because my apartment was being painted, and I didn't want to spend a fortune for a hotel. I was quite happy with my stay. It was such a joy to stay in a very spacious room. The desk area was separate from the living area which was separate from the area where the bed was. I get claustrophobic in hotel rooms quite often and this room was very comfortable and spacious. The staff was very friendly, including housekeeping and doorman. The location can't be beat! One block East of Michigan Avenue and all the great shopping and restaurants and bus routes just steps away! For the price and location, the Mile North Hotel offers a great value. There are nicer hotels for a romantic getaway or for a vacation, but if you are there on business, shopping trip, in Chicago visiting family, this place is great. Free W-Fi and had no problems getting on. The only complaints I had were: the bed could be more comfortable (I found it a little too hard). Also, on the ceiling outside my bathroom, the paint was peeling. It's not a large ceiling area so to re-paint wouldn't be an arduous task. It would be a lot more appealing to fix it. I would stay here again if needed.


Room Tip: Having a city view is nicer, although it will cost more.

"I stayed here a number of times when it was the Affinia, and have now stayed about 3 times after the transition to MileNorth. I'm not sure I'll go back. The room was fine, the front desk staff were fine, and the place in general is lively and inviting. I do miss the restaurant that was there when it was the Affinia. That place was beautiful, and I was always happy with the food. It think the appeal of the property has diminished by its absence. But there were a couple of things that really bugged me this time in the form of policy. My wife and I arrived at the desk around noon, and wanted to check in. I know we were early. We were told that for $29 we could check in early. No way that's gonna happen. I don't understand why a room isn't just given to a customer if it's available. In my opinion, letting me have the room because it's ready, and I'm there, is zero. So charge me zero. It seems to me that for no cost to MileNorth, they could have made me happy, and this review would be a lot different. Keep in mind the front desk staff never said the room wasn't available. And on to the next thing.... An up-front charge of $65 was made to my card for incidentals. That haven't been consumed. That one is tough to fathom, but I don't purchase incidental items, so I don't get it. My wife did the check in, and was blindsided by the charge explanation from the front desk. I wasn't there, and definitely would have fought back. At check-out, the charge was gone, but by that time, the PR damage had been done. Because of these 2 policies, I personally felt punished, either because others have taken advantage of the hotel in some way, or MileNorth has figured out a way to make a few more dollars. I don't think hotels should be rewarded for these kinds of policies. I'm upset by this experience, and don't like saying bad things about businesses. I love the hotel, and it's location, but I thought the PR loss associated with these policies is significant. There are too many lodging options in Chicago.

"I was surprised at how quiet this hotel was. The windows are covered in an extra pane of glass which serves to reduce the noise to near zero. As well, during the 4 nights I stayed here, I only heard other guests in the hallway a couple of times, and never any noise from adjoining rooms. Sure, there was the occasional muted siren from ambulances arriving at the neighbouring hospital, but these were not disturbing in any way.The room was a good size and the bed positively huge. Furnishings were of a high standard and there was the nice touch of the reclining armchair next to the window with the street view. Ask for a room facing the front of the hotel for the better views - the ones in the back overlook the backs of other buildings.Our room was on the 5th floor, which meant it was serviced by 2 elevators which were dedicated to the 1st - 7th floors. This was fortuitous for us, since the remaining 8th - 29th floors were serviced by 2 other elevators, one of which was out of commission for our entire stay. As a result there were very long lines and excessive waits for those residing in the upper floors. I would have rated this hotel as ""very good"" instead of ""excellent"" if I had been impacted directly by this issue.We did travel up to the 29th floor to have a light meal in the roof lounge. Since it was winter, only the very small indoor section was open, but we were lucky enough to get a table and enjoyed the views over the city. Food was good and there was a good selection of drinks.Location is perfect, an easy walk to shopping, restaurants and even down to Grant Park and the Art Institute. We really recommend visiting the Dreihaus Museum. We've been to Chicago 3 times and only just discovered it this time. Beautiful place and exception Tiffany exhibit on while we were there.Staff were friendly and efficient. The room was in good shape, with some minor wear and tear in the bathroom (peeling wallpaper, some minor water damage). Overall a very nice place for a reasonable price."
"Mile North was so warm and cozy I would return. Check in was quick and easy. I stayed by myself so the room was the perfect size for me. There was enough room for me to work on my lap top, listen to my ipod and then watch television. The bathroom was very cute too. I love Chicago and this area is close to everything. In particular, it is a short walk to the train, my favorite pizza place and my favorite wine bar. Not to mention the roof top bar. The drinks were pricey, but it was a nice place to hang out with friends."

"I was booking relatively last minute and have stayed at numerous properties within the city. I would not hesitate to return here. As many have mentioned, the location is ideal, steps from Michigan Avenue and Northwestern University medical campus. There are numerous cafes, coffee houses, a Walgreens, and of course a great mix of high end and moderate stores and shops. About 6 blocks away, you will find a Trader Joe's, which is a great place to pick up some grocery items plus wine and beer.The staff was courteous, pleasant and aimed to please. Even though I had an early arrival into the city, they easily accommodated me and I was in my room by 11:30 am. For a double, it was spacious, well laid out and had comfortable bedding and an ample sized bathroom with a great shower. (no tub, didn't care). Only complaint was the water pressure. For such a nice shower, I really wanted to linger, but spent most of the time just trying to wash the soap off of me and the shampoo/conditioner out of my hair. I did appreciate that they had built in pumps for shampoo, conditioner, and body wash. At most hotels, of course, these products come in sample sized tubes, but I liked the fact that they were taking a greener approach. The windows were double paned, which was a must here as emergency vehicles came and went at all hours of the day and night. I had a very peaceful night's sleep. I did not have a chance to try the rooftop lounge nor the bakery/cafe in the small lobby. Both seemed inviting and popular. If you are a deep dish lover, you will be delighted to find a Gino's East literally next door. Being a Lou Malnati's fan myself, I did not indulge in one of their decadent pies. If you are looking for a small, clean, comfortable and reasonable hotel, this one certainly fits the bill."
"I've stayed in Chicago several times and the rooms have been ok but small. Our room here was amazing. SO spacious and long. I was amazed. For the price I paid I couldn't believe our luck. Hotel is centrally situated and very modern and nice. Our room was on the 4th floor. We had a huge kingsize bed that was super comfy, a seating area with another tv (had 2 in the room which was even more surprising). Good size closet with an iron & ironing board and safe in it. Nice coffee maker and fridge. The bathroom was superb. Large shower with nice powerful jet (walk in - room for 2!) nice soft fluffy towels and really liked the products left in there. Nice to have shampoo, shower gel & conditioner provided to you. Our room was north facing and was very quiet, didn't hear any outside noise. Room was spotless.What I liked even more was the fact that they offered a ""go green"" scheme which meant if you chose to opt out of having a maid come clean your room that you would receive a voucher worth $5 to use in the cafe/bar area located in the lobby. We did this as for 2 days we didn't care if the maid came in or not. This helped towards our yummy breakfast we enjoyed in cafe area. Lots of variety to choose from and all fresh. We also enjoyed a couple of glasses of wine, once again lots of variety. I would stay there again and highly recommend this hotel. It was definitely an enjoyable stay. Oh and the view from our window was pretty cool...looked out and saw the Hancock Tower - that was pretty amazing!

"I stayed here on a one-night business trip. Arrived late, and I was upgraded to a queen suite on the 26th floor. Overall my impression was of a midwestern version of a Euro style boutique hotel. The suite was attactrive, roomy and comfortable. The lobby offered bar fare in the evening and Starbuck's coffee and food in the morning. The rooftop bar was not for me, not liking heights. The view from my room was directly at the Sears tower. Shopping nearby was great. I am recommending this to my friends who travel to Chicago."
"Our group reserved 7 rooms at this hotel. The location was excellent and the rooms were very nice. My corner room was on a high floor and very quiet. The bed was comfortable although the duvet type covers were too hot for comfortable sleeping. There seemed to be a major disconnect with some of the personnel. We were told that we could use a room by one receptionist and the next day were told that we couldn't use that room nor any other for our group. My most disappointing experience was with the hotel taxi stand. At 4:45pm I asked the attendant if he could get two vans @6pm to transport our group of 15 to Bucktown. He said that I needed to talk to the receptionist about it and that he couldn't do it. The receptionist said that she would talk with him. When we got to the taxi stand @6 there was one cab. Another one came later. Finally he directed our final group of 5 to a van. We asked what the cost would be to Bucktown and were told $30 but were charged $40 when we arrived. No meter. Three cabs to the same address paid $17, $28 and $40. Something didn't feel right about that and left a bad impression.

The walls were a little thin at night and the pillows were very ""hard!"" I usually bring my own but forgot. We loved having a fridge in the room too. The staff was exceptional From check in to check out!! The bar in the lobby was nice and welcoming. We loved Emily! She took excellent care of us and had some fun conversation.

"This hotel is very nice. Clean, modern rooms. There's a rooftop bar, but we didn't visit it so I can't comment on it. I loved having the coffee shop in the lobby, which serves Starbucks! The location right off Michigan Ave was perfect! My only complaints...valet parking for 2 nights was over $100! The only mirror in our room was the small one above the sink in the bathroom. It was very difficult for my husband and I to get ready at the same time. And lastly, try getting a room on a lower floor. We were on the 28th floor and we waited a long time for the elevators."
"Really enjoyed staying at the Mile North Hotel. Great location, which we were close to walk to all our favorite restaurants and shopping on Michigan Ave. The room was very nice and roomy. The bed was very comfortable and the linens and towels were quality. The coffee shop in the lobby was so convenient for a morning cappuccino. The staff at the front desk were absolutely wonderful, always a smile, hello and welcome. We will definitely return here for our next visit to the Windy City. I forgot to mention the awesome rooftop bar. Great outdoor couches and settings with awesome views. Brecken the bartender was delightful, he was so friendly and made our evening very special."
I love this place. If I visit Chicago I will choose this hotel. It's. A great location downtown and is walking distance to a lot of things and a short distance to the red line. The staff was some of the best I have experienced they were more than courteous and very accommodating. Their recommendations were really good and they were able to provide good directions to other places. They do have free wifi and it was pretty good. The beds were a bit hard but not unusable like others had mentioned. We didn't rent a car so we did not pay the $$ for the parking. However on the downside they do charge to have a microwave a few of 20$ per day yikes. My infant son likes warm formula and so he had room temperature. But overall it was perfect. I am very appreciative of the quality of serv that was provided.
"We stayed at this hotel in August 2014 whilst traveling the USA, the hotel has a nice fresh entrance lobby and a small coffee/alcoholic bar set within it. Our room was a nice size and felt clean, the bed was comfy also. The location was great for what we wanted, right on the Magnificent Mile (well just a 10 second walk anyway!). There are restaurants nearby however we did have a 10-15 minute walk one night to find a restaurant we fancied, that is just us though! The only negative comments we had were that when we checked in the check in staff put a numbered tag on our luggage and left our suitcases on a roller in the middle of the lobby, we asked if we could take them to our room ourselves but were told that we were not allowed (Insurance purposes maybe?), we had many valuables in there and felt reluctant to leave our goods, we hung by the lift for around 5-10 minutes waiting for the bell boy but he never appeared, we took it upon ourselves to remove our cases from the roller and take them all up ourselves, as we were travelling we had 4 suitcases and 2 shoulder bags, this was an inconvenience as when you pay for service you do expect slightly more, it was just too greater risk leaving our bags unattended by an open front door for anyone to steal. The other comment is that our bedroom floor by the A/C unit was soaking wet, presumably from the unit itself, we did not bother to complain as we were only there for a few nights but surely the bedroom maids would have noticed when cleaning? Anyway, not a bad hotel but stayed in a lot better for the money. Really nice rooftop bar in the evenings for cocktails!


Room Tip: I would try and get a room with a view facing the front of the hotel.

"You pay for the location, which is great. It's half a block off of Michigan Ave. Feature wise, nothing to write home about. Fuzzy TV signal, and constantly running toilet, which started to overflow our last morning there. Bathrooms could use some updating. Chipped tiles and the tub wasn't the cleanest. No complaints about elevators, and we were on one of the higher floors. Our view was into an office building so we could see people working. You WILL get charged a $9 per day fee at check out, no way of avoiding that. Of course, they don't mention it until you are checking out. I'm not sure I would stay there again based on what we had to pay for the hotel."
"Good location in relation to the Magnificent Mile. Chic lobby. Room was pretty basic - but I did like how there were two levels (bed/tv/nightstand on one level, couple steps up was the bathroom, closet, bar/refrigerator area). The chipped painting in the bathroom was a turn off. We stayed on the 25th floor, and I didn't find the wait time for the elevator to be too long, like some others had mentioned. I requested a high floor for a good view, however, our view was simply into an office building. PS. there is no baby changing station in the hotel lobby's bathroom. Frustrating since I needed one ASAP when we arrived and couldn't wait for the check-in process."
"I visit Chicago every year for work stay in a different hotel every time as an attempt to see more of the city. This time I stayed at the Mile North hotel with my son and mother who watched him while I worked. It was a great location not a far walk from the Magnificent Mile and everyone was so friendly. My Mom walked my son everywhere and the staff at Mile North were so helpful, kind and friendly. My son is 13 months and very active the staff helped her with the stroller and gave her directions and guidance on how to get around the city. Not to mention it was very clean the rooms were spacious and beautiful and the grab and go restaurant was very handy. Our room was near the elevator so I was originally concerned about noise but it really was very quiet."
"We arrived at the hotel today having been on the road for 17 hours and just as we arrived, disaster struck. The cab driver pulled the trunk lever, it shot open and crashed back down on my head gashing the skin on my skull with lots of blood evident. This is when the front desk team really came into their own, providing antiseptic, gauze, cream and sticking plaster plus an ice pack to take down the swelling.They reported the cab driver for not recording the incident and in our disarray, having left things at the desk, they called up to the room to bring things to us.They left three messages on our phone updating us on their actions with the cab firm and enquiring as to my health. How good did I feel, despite the lump and obvious plaster on my head ?As for the hotel, it's perfectly positioned just off the mile, all top notch shops a few yards away and the lake front just a couple of short blocks.The room is very well proportioned with two double beds, a lovely clean bathroom, safe, hair dryer and large flat screen TV with a great choice of channels.WiFi is free and efficient and there is a Starbucks in the foyer.You will love this place- and the people that work here."
"My wife and I actually live in Chicago, but we recently stayed at MileNorth for a brief getaway and a nice night out. MileNorth was the perfect choice. The hotel is in a fantastic location, immediately near all the great restaurants and shopping Michigan Avenue is known for. However, we actually ended up spending most of our time at the hotel's rooftop bar. It has great views of the city accompanied by a very cool atmosphere. The drinks and food were delicious, and all at a reasonable price.As far as the room, it was a very good size compared to the average Chicago hotel room. And it has a great new, updated style and feel. But best of all, it was very clean and fresh.Finally, we were very impressed with the hotel staff. They were extremely professional and courteous. They offer a cool type of concierge service called UrbanBuddy which is great to find things to do and places to see around the city. Ultimately, they went above and beyond to ensure we had a pleasant stay. Even the bar tender at the main lobby bar, was engaging and thoughtful. He noticed we were carrying a bottle of wine with us to our room and gave us two wine glasses and offered to open the bottle for us!"
"Our first time in Chicago and the photos of the hotel were what drew us in. We were not let down. We arrived late in the night, but check in was simple and the room was immaculate. The king bed was very comfortable, a separate lounge area and a small business desk which wasn't needed for us but a nice touch. The bathroom was a little on the smaller side and the only negative to report here was the water pressure in the shower was very bad, so after a long say out site seeing, to come back for a lousy shower was disappointing. Location wise we could not fault it. Very close to the amazing lake, navy pier, John Hancock observatory and close to magnificent mile. The rooftop bar had an amazing view but was very cold the night we had beers there, convenient to shops and transport (buses and subway). We had heard of the Ginos east pizza which is next door, it was ok. Overall a great hotel and would surely stay again


Room Tip: We were level 13, had a great view over parts of Chicago City. Ask for a South facing room

"We live in the city and were looking for a little stay-cation, mile north gave us great views of the Hancock building and gave is the feeling we were in a different place in our own city.Right away we had a friendly valet open our doors to lead us into this unique lobby. We were greeted by friendly knowledgable staff, who directed us to their roof top bar! Talk about an urban oasis! We had great weather so this was an ideal place to relax with a glass of wine. Our room had a clean modern feel to it, random but the lighting in the bathroom was amazing for doing make up. The internet TV was not great, we thought about ordering a movie but was $16.99, which seemed high especially because the tv wasn't great.We wanted to see what was around and even being locals we were a bit out of touch with the area, the hotel directed us towards the 'Urban buddy' app which instantly hooked us up with spots we had never heard of before. We had a great stay, I would stay here again, and recommend it for any family or friends who come to town."
"Just returned from a weeks stay at this lovely hotel. The rooms are spacious, well decorated and very comfortable. The reception is well decorated and the in house Starbucks coffee shop was very handy after a long days shopping. The location is amazing, just off Michigan mile.....good to drop off all your purchases and continue shopping without being laden down...lol. The staff were pleasant and helpful at all times and the rooftop bar was a great place to relax and 'chill' after a day seeing the mant many great sights of Chicago.Definately recommend."
"This was our first visit to the MN, and we really loved our very modern & clean room. We often like to visit the North Michigan street area for summer evening fun. The MN easily ranks as good, if not better than the other boutique hotels we have visited in the area for this purpose. Using the 'net, I was able to score 1/2 price parking just around the corner from the hotel. SUPER!!To cap off our visit, the fantastic Labor Day 2014 weather made the rooftop lounge a perfect place to unwind after our evening dinner. The MN will be the FIRST place I try to book the next time we visit Chicago."
"My husband and I recently stayed here for a business trip. The hotel is in a good location for proximity to the Magnificent Mile. We were on the 27th floor, right next to the elevator. There was some elevator noise in our room, but nothing unbearable. It was nice to have the separate seating area, and my husband really appreciated the reclining chair. We also visited the rooftop bar, which is nice. The front desk staff was very friendly, and the doorman always greeted us with a smile. Price seemed a bit high. The included wifi was a nice bonus. I'm not sure if our view was a ""city view"" but because we were on the 27th floor, we did have a nice view of the surrounding buildings. There is a Gino's East pizza restaurant right next door, which I had never heard of, but is apparently famous, as there was always a long line waiting to get in.


Room Tip: Try not to stay next to the elevator, although there are only about 5 or so rooms per floor, so you...

"Overall a very nice, trendy hotel. Bistro in the lobby, rooftop bar/lounge, and nicely sized rooms with modern and ""chicago"" decor. Two complaints: 1) the elevator service was extremely slow and small. Even if an elevator did happen to make it to your floor, it was unlikely that you could squeeze your way into one since only 6 people could fit not to mention luggage etc. 2) The Rooftop bar often has events on the weekends (weddings, etc) so you may be (rudely) greeted by a young lady telling you that it is closed and to come back in 3 hours. Great...now you have to wait for the elevator again....Honestly - it was a good location, good room, and interesting lobby. No major hospitality provided and I would say great for the do-it-yourself traveler. Elevators would be difficult to fix - I understand - but maybe more signage regarding events for the rooftop bar opening/closings."
"MileNorth seeks to be an uber hip boutique hotel, from the lobby to the rooms but i've had better experiences in budget hotels. Located a block off Michigan Ave., other than Gino's East Pizza and the side door to Nieman Marcus, there is nothing else around. The lobby, decorated with modern couches and chairs, is dominated by Starbucks and a bar and feels cold. The front desk is little more than a 6-foot wide stand near the elevators looking to be constructed of old valises. The hotel has a restaurant, but there is no place for breakfast within blocks. We purchased some items in Walgreen around the corner and stored them in the mini-fridge. Our rooms had the bathroom, decorated in bright orange foil, 3 steps above the sleeping area. Not a great idea for nighttime pitstops. Our 17th floor MileNorth double room didn't have much of a view, but not a big deal, but the mattress seemed way to short. I am not tall, but my feet were off the bottom edge. Weekend housing keeping was a joke. We spent most of our Saturday out sightseeing. Housekeeping showed up a 5 pm while we were showering and dressing for a wedding. The housekeeper never returned. Our room went unmade, dirty coffee cups and towels littered the room and trash baskets overflowed. Family members in another room requested housekeeping to clean up some broken glass received no response. We complained upon checking out, but received nothing but sorries for our troubles."
"The staff was GREAT, thanks Dora (at front desk) hooked me up with a suite. It was beautiful. Loved the room, Urban buddy is a GREAT app and everyone should download and get this app when visiting any city. It provides you with real locals who know their city, and can tell you the best hole-in-the-wall spots to check out, just like a text!

"This hotel is behind Northwestern Hopsital and used to be accomodation for staff. It has been done up well but you can still detect an institutional feel in the corridors and from the old heating/colling and plumbing system.Check in was quick and service was okay--a bit perfunctory. I had many packages delivered and the bellman promised to deliver them after helping me with my bags. However, after an hour I had to go and find him. He said he had been busy. I stood in the reception area to make sure I got my packages. One went missing but the duty receptionist found it after a few hours. The next day I had laundry which was again not delivered to my room on arrival. I had to go to reception to get it from the bellman. I had a very early morning flight and so wanted to settle my bill the night before. Unfortunately, the room night charge is only posted after midnight. I had paid in advance for a guaranteed rate and so the system was showing I had a credit but the staff kept reading this as money I owed. It took nearly 20 minutes to sort this out. That being said, the night receptionists are very friendly and efficient. One gave me a wake up call and had the bellman come to my room to pick up my luggage (unasked) 5 minutes before the time I had ordered a cab for. Truly first rate service.Room size is spacious and decor modern with large flat screen TV. You get free high speed Internet. There is a 24 hour small gym which has all you need, including free weights, weight machines, treadmills and jogging machines.There is a tiny Starbucks outlet in the lobby to have breakfast at--you are better off going across the street to St. Claire's and eating with all the hospital workers. Bottomline: I got value for money and would stay here again, but service could be improved by the concierge team in particular and all reception staff should know how to check out a guest who has paid in advance. The hotel is also justifiably popular so it can get very crowded in the lobby and waiting for an elevator. As other guests have noted, the room doors also slam shut and can wake you up."
"Lovely modern comfortable hotel in an excellent location. 2mins walk for the mag mile with abundance of shops. Not many places to eat/drink directly around but walk a bit and youll find them.Large ""Suite Like"" room with all the extras, only downfall was the AC - noisy and cold and windows couldnt be opened. Staff are lovely and the terrace bar worth a visit. As was the lobby bar for food and drinks.Would run back!"
"My husband and I stayed at this hotel last weekend and had a fabulous time. Hotel check-in and checkout was efficient, and staff at the desk were friendly and provided us with great dinner and site seeing recommendations. It is walking distance for great shopping and dining options. The room was spacious and clean and the roof top patio provides a fantastic view of the city. The staff at the roof top patio were friendly and the drink and dining menu was impressive. Being pregnant the bar tender was kind enough to create a fun non-alcoholic beverage. I would stay here again. Chicago is a great city!"
"We stopped in Chicago on the way home from Ohio and booked this hotel the day before. It's downtown in Chicago and is fairly new so thought $200 was very reasonable pricing. Checking In was fine and the bellman was very friendly and helpful. We had a suite with a queen bed but my sister and I didn't want to share so I used the pull out sofa. It was like a foam block.we called room service for an extra blanket for me because all that's offered is a sheet and another thin blanket, they said it'd be 20 minutes but it never showed up. Our room was in a corner and the staff only cleaning room was right beside us. When the cleaning ladies showed up in the morning they were VERY loud. They constantly slammed the door and were laughing and talking loudly outside our door which woke us up. You'd just get back to sleep and it'd start all over again. The rooms definitely need more insulting to block out hallway noise. I had also stood at the Starbucks counter for at least five minutes without being acknowledged. There was two guys working and they'd look at me and then continue doing something other then helping me so I finally left. The hotel is nice and renovated and on a fairly quiet side street but overall I'd hoped for something better."
"This is my second stay here within a 6 month period and I was very satisfied after the first 2 night stay so I re-booked and was excited to stay 3 nights this time. Well my excitement was quickly brought to a halt when my daughter opened the sofa bed up to discover that it was badly broken and hanging on the floor to the point of where she couldn't sleep on it. As if that wasn't enough, the mattress was so soiled with spots and stains that it had a smell. They ended up bringing us a roll away bed and eventually moved us to another smaller room the next afternoon. After requesting on 2 separate occasions to speak with a member of management my request was never granted and it never happened. I'm so disappointed with MileNorth since I put them in a different category than other chain hotels... I guess they are just the average hotel in a good area with average to poor service. Not a good look MileNorth...SMH

"Stayed for three nights due to our son's orientation at Northwestern Chicago campus. Hotel was convienent to the school, dining, shopping and bus stops. The staff was friendly and helpful with directions to places we wanted to go. Our room was on the 24th floor and was very quiet. We choose to skip housekeeping during our stay which meant no one but us came and went from our room. We would stay there again."
"Stayed here for 3 nights with my wife last weekend. This hotel is located just off Michican Avenue, near to the Water Tower with loads of shopping around the corner. We asked for, and received a room above the 15th floor, to reduce street noise. The only downside was that we didn't have a great view, we could see the John Hancock between the buildings though. The room itself was a decent size, good facilities, powerful shower with a very handy fridge for fruit and snacks (there's a good Trader Joe's in the vicinity). Downstairs the foyer has a cool, modern layout with a coffee shop on one side. Of course, we had to sample the Chicago deep-pan pizza next door in Gino's East, a local favorite. Overall, no complaints at all really (wifi is extra however) and we got our 3 nights at a good rate."
"Upon arrival, we were greeted warmly by Cynthia at the front desk. We were given the wrong room on accident but they upgraded us to a suite immediately after they found out which was appreciated very much. Our A/C coil froze as well which caused our room to become very warm but there was someone there to fix it within 30 minutes of telling them about it. The shower curtain absorbed some of the water and leaked it onto the floor once or twice. We really enjoyed that you are given $5 each day you choose to forgo a full room cleaning. We also appreciated the mini-fridge because many hotels don't supply those anymore. The suite provided a secured lock box (although we didn't use it) and plenty of storage. A con was the television. The television is a high definition set on a expensive wall mount and it has, what seems to be, below standard definition cable access. We didn't watch much but some of the channels reminded me of the days of rabbit ears. This was the case in both rooms so I'm pretty sure it wasn't a room specific issue. Throughout our stay, we needed new towels and an extra pillow. With the towels, they said they would be up in a bit and they never showed up so we called the next morning and they eventually came while we were out all day. With the pillow, we called at around 9 o'clock and we again didn't get it that night but eventually the next day while we were out. The hotel has two elevators for floors 7-29, which isn't quite enough. We were only there for four days and it wasn't extremely busy yet on several occasions, we waited longer than ideal. I know this isn't something that can just be changed instantly, I just wanted to let readers aware. There is a fantastic coffee shop in the lobby as well. Overall, we really love the hotel and it's location but the somewhat shady service and rough television/shower curtain situations kept it from receiving a 5/5 rating. We would recommend the hotel and plan on returning!

"Milenorth is a great hotel and I love the new renovations! The designer really did a great job. As an architect with an extensive design background working in Barcelona and New York, I appreciate when a hotel pays attention to detail. The new mobile concierge service they offer is awesome, too! Powered by Chicago based startup, UrbanBuddy, I was connected to a local expert in under 2 minutes! Very cool. UrbanBuddy helped me with anything I needed from where to eat, how to get around and what to do! Thanks!"
"We stayed at The Milenorth the weekend of May 31st. When we checked in I asked if they could bring us up two champagne glasses (we were there to celebrate our first wedding anniversary). After 45 minutes of not recieving the glasses I called and again asked that they send us up two glasses; we finally recieved those 30 minutes later. The hotel was in a great location, right off Michicgan Ave by Watertower. We walked ever where, while Millenium Park, Grant Park & Navy Pier aren't close about a 30 min walk everywhere you go will be a walk. The hotel was very nice on the inside, the little cafe and all the seating was nice. We only used it to get something to drink Sunday morning. Our room was just fine, nothing outstanding big bed with chair and smal table. The room did not have much lighting and there we no light switches, you had to turn them on at the lamp. We did have view of the the Hancock building. The best part about the room was the bathoom, it was very large and had a huge walk in shower. The shampoo, conditioner, and body wash were attached to the shower wall, but they were full size bottles and you didn't have to worry about using all of it before your spouse had a shower.The worst problem I had was when we checked out and found out there was a $4.95 hotel service fee. I called the front desk to find out what this charge was since I hadn't been told about it during check in. I was told that this was a Hotel Service fee that is added to all bills. The women at the front desk said I could find it on my confirmation reciept. I wlooked and was still unable to find it, I was then told that this fee went to the Children's hospital next door. This didn't sound right to me and I explained that to the guest services person. At that point she said it's only $4.95 and I'll refund it for you. While I agree with the women $4.95 is not a lot of money I still don't think it's good to sneak in those extra charges."
"MileNorth is an OK hotel, maybe even good at it's price tag. The rooms are large and the interior has a modern touch to it, though it is not entirely up-to-date I'd say, it's between eighties classic and late nineties, might be updated once more. We had the option to opt out from housekeeping, which is great for two reasons; first of all it's better for the environment but you also get a 5$ voucher to spent at their breakfast/lunch eatery (Ferris & Jack). A definite minor would be the charge of $15 for hotel service fees (for 3 nights). First of all; not much service that we received/used would fit into such category, more important; never in the booking process jetsetter mentioned such a fee. When I pointed that out the staff was so kind as to drop this fee. The shared spaces in the hotel are comfortable, modern and stylish.

We stayed in the Milenorth hotel in Chicago for week in May 2014 and again found it a very pleasent stay. It is a block from Michigan Avenue close to all the great shops on Magnificient mile. It is also about a 30 min walk to Millenium Park and Grant Park where you you could easily spend a few hours in the parks. The hotel itself was very clean and welll run and could find no fault with hotel or staff.I would recommend this hotel to anyone visiting Chicago.
"This place was great with a great location and our room had an amazing view. It close to shopping and the John Hancock building and blocks from the beach. We had 75, 79, 76 degree weather it couldn't have been nicer. I wish it was closer to public transit but we ended up walking everywhere. The hotel has nice big room with a trendy vibe but the staff was mediocre not bad but not great. We had a family next to us who kids would run up and down the hall screaming at 5am when I complained they said they have a one strike policy and the next day it happened again I complained again and they said they will be warned. The next day we where leaving at 9 am so when it happened again I didn't complain because we where leaving and I had seen what 2 days of complaint had done. Otherwise this hotel was ok I think I will try another location next time.

"We spent four days and three nights in Chicago with family; each family had their own room at the MileNorth hotel. The service was excellent, rooms clean, comfortable and spacious. I recommend this hotel and will stay there again.It is centrally located to many of the Chicago area attractions. So many restaurants you could hardly decide which one to choose. We look forward to when we can go back again."
"I very much enjoyed all aspects of the Mile North Hotel. It offers everything needed along with a perfect location for enjoying all that the city has to offer. I would highly recommend the character and charm this hotel has to offer, along with all the amenities one would need in comparison to one of the large chain hotels.

I decided to stay here because of the great reviews I read. I arrived a little earlier than check-in and it was no problem at all. I was taken to my room with in a few minutes and boy was it beautiful!! Great decor and perfect use of space. I wish the tub in the bathroom was deeper but totally not a deal breaker. My view was spectacular at night; the lights of the city are simply dreamy. The location was perfect for shopping and eating. The cafe in the lobby totally fed my addiction for Starbucks; loved it!! When I return to Chicago I will more than likely try my best to get back into MileNorth!!!!
"I had a rough flight into Chicago and when I walked into the hotel, they upgraded me to a suite. It was so unexpected and it erased the previous awful 24 hours I had. The staff was so accommodating and the whole vibe of the hotel is trendy, fun, and modern. It's in a really safe and fun area, there is plenty of shopping and even a Trader Joe's in case you need groceries. I went for a run along the water and the front desk gave me a map so I felt confident about where to go."
"I stayed at the MileNorth for 5 nights recently while helping a friend who was having major surgery at Northwestern Memorial Hospital. The hotel is one block from the hospital complex. It isw a half block off the Magnificient Mile, and near lots of attractions and restaurants, etc. The MileNorth is a boutique hotel with very helpful staff, a busy, but friendly and inviting lobby and spectacular rooms. My room had a king size bed, with fold out sofa in a separate living room area. Seating was comfortable, with a wonderful lounge chair included. Large windows overlooked the street below. In the lobby, you could get an informal breakfast, coffee, wine and snacks. Computers were there availabe for use, and helpful staff made using them a breeze. Daily newspaper was available for the taking along with area guides. The gym on the 7th floor was quite adequate. I did not get to try the lounge on the 29th floor but it sounded marvelous. Would definitely stay there again and again.


Room Tip: Room 1001 was large and comfy, with big windows overlooking the street below.

"I usually pat myself on the shoulder making right choice when I go with tripadvisor's review and this was a quite unusual case. This was a mediocre hotel and indeed I didn't like their practice. There was a surprise charge every corner. My arrival at O'hare was 10:30AM. So I called the hotel front desk before making reservation several months before to confirm that they would do their best to accommodate early check-in as long as available. Arrival Day. After I picked up my luggage, I called the hotel and asked if there is availability for early check-in, they said there is a room and they will charge me $35 for early check-in. Unpleasantly surprised, I arrived at the hotel. Unlike what I heard on the phone, this person at the front desk gave me key without charging. Strange practice this hotel has. One night we were dining in one of the great steak houses in Chicago and had so much left overs. So I called the hotel to see if there is a microwave we can use in the hotel. I was told they can send a microwave to our room but we have to pay $35 for it. I asked whether that was a deposit. The person said no. The hotel is quite not accommodating. We had to leave all the great steak sides and left over steaks behind us. The last day morning, I saw a huge bill under the door. I called the front desk and asked what it was. The hotel fridge had nothing. Not even water. I used my phone the whole time. What else can it possibly be? They said they charge for WIFI and they charged every night! Excuse me? The hotel website does not say they charge for wifi anywhere and even when they gave me wifi password at check-in they never mentioned they will charge. Haha. This made me laugh. These guys are ridiculous. The person who answered the call offered to delete this charge with a strange reason ; ""Oh, you made a reservation a while ago"". Really? So if I made a reservation recently, then, I have to pay for Wifi when you never told me this is not free? Things they did quite made no sense to me. Very strange practice. The hotel did not look a sketchy establishment at all. Indeed, other than this strange/unaccommodating behavior of staffs, I thought the hotel was pretty decent. I paid good money for it too. Hence the disappointment was there."
"A good hotel for our first visit to Chicago, good location to walk to everything you need and to get on a train and we felt safe in the area at night. It's approx 1hr from O'hare airport by train, one change required so not difficult and the same line will get you to the ball park too. Starbucks and bar in reception are convenient, rooftop bar is good but expensive. We went to Gino's next door for deep dish pizza, the hotel will give you a VIP pass to skip the queue and also a free entree! The bed at the hotel wasn't very comfortable and dipped in the middle and the safe wasn't usable nor fixed despite asking at reception a couple of times. I would still stay here again though."
"The hotel exceeded all expectations. It's a stone's throw away from North Michigan Avenue, and a few minutes walk from public transport if you want to go further afield. Oh and it's right next door to Gino's pizza restaurant.For the price and location, I don't think we could have done better.The hotel is clean and stylish. The room we had was a queen-sized suite on the 18th floor and was very spacious. There was a safety deposit box in the room, as well as a hairdryer, iron, ironing board, toiletries (though no shower cap), coffee making facility, TV, sofa, reclining armchair, desk and dressing table. We also had a view of the John Hancock building from our window.Would definitely recommend the hotel, and if we're ever back in Chicago we'll certainly be using it again."
"After more than a days worth of travel, we finally arrived at MileNorth in desperate need of some good food, restful sleep and some space to stretch out - Thankfully, MileNorth ticked all these boxes, and very well I might add.When we arrived, I sent down my wife to the in-house restaurant, and there she fetched us a couple of salads as a late night feed before we went to bed - the salads were both crop and fresh and actually very tasty, which left us pleasantly surprised!The room size was huge: we had a separate sitting area with sofa and coffee table and a entry mezzanine section with the writing desk (for those of you on business)! We also noticed how clean the rooms were kept both at the beginning and for the duration of our stay.Location is brilliant and the perfect base for exploring all sections of the city. We mostly walked our way through both the northern and southern parts of the city.There were however a couple of things that kept MileNorth just below the 5 star rating:The bed. While this is all personal preference, I personally found it difficult to wake up each morning without some form of back pain after sleeping in the very soft pillows and mattresses, so that's a heads up for you firm mattress sleepers!There was a lack of communication around the charges that I should expecting from my credit card when I checked in. Not only they held the price of the reservation, I was also charged the resort fee and a $60 a night bond amount for incidentals. While I appreciate these charges, it would have been nice for MileNorth to be upfront with these charges instead of me having to guess the pending charges from my credit card - especially when I rang the service desk one evening and nobody called back to clarify the charges I should be expecting.The last thing that annoyed me slightly was when we went to use the hotel safe, it was already locked, so we rang the reception area asking them to send someone to open the safe and the response was, 'I will organise someone from engineering to come to your room.' Needless to say, engineering never arrived!While each of these negatives, in my opinion, were only a small part of our stay, by no means would it impact our future stays, it's simply the little things that kept my review below 5 stars. Please take into consideration that the positives by far outweigh the negatives, so look no further for Chicago's best value for money option."
"We arrived at the hotel after the journey from hell from the airport. My wallet was stolen at the station we got off at. We arrived at the hotel really stressed. Danny the night manager was amazing. He was calm and helpful. He helped us phone the police, gave us helpful advice and probably most importantly gave us a complimentary drink. Thereafter he continually checked in with us to make sure we were ok. Thank you Danny. The guys in Ferris and Jack made sure we were fed and watered and had great chat. The room was huge and comfortable and we really enjoyed our stay. Following our trauma on the ' l ' the concierge organised our trip back to the airport which was highly efficient and a great joy. We really can't speak highly enough about this hotel."
"I arrived at the hotel around 11PM on a Tuesday. When I checked in and went up to my room it sounded like popcorn was going off above my head (I recorded audio from the room). When I called down to say there is no way anyone with normal hearing could sleep with that noise the lady at the front desk offered me earplugs. I thought she was kidding. She was not. She said she would look into the problem. Now it is around 11:30PM and I have a meeting the next morning. Suffice it to say the fact that the hotel staff took no immediate steps to fix this situation was totally unreasonable in my eyes. When I checked back fifteen minutes or so later the lady informed me that they were fixing kitchen fans above the room I was in and that the rest of the rooms in the hotel were booked. She then offered me complementary breakfast in the morning. Once again I hoped she was joking. She was not. I had a meeting the following morning and it was almost midnight. I asked for the manager. She said she was the manager. Great. I assumed she was not truthful that the rooms were all full and so I tried that angle. After much aggravation, she finally moved me to another room. She was not pleasant about this and acted as if I should thank her for doing me a favor. In the room there were several places where wall paper was peeling and the toilet paper holding was falling off of the wall in the bathroom. I guess on the upside at least I had a place to sleep.


Room Tip: Don't stay on the top floor.

"I loved this hotel. The room was sparkling clean. Very updated with a lot of great qualities. The bathroom was big with a separate tub and shower stall. The lobby was cool with plenty of seating, a bar, and a gas fireplace. The exercise room wasn't big, but good enough. It. Had 8 cardio machines...dumbells from 5 to 50 pounds, a few machines.It just had a very cool, laid back vibe to it. It always had customers in the lobby, but it never had a busy, touristy feel to it. I would definitely stay there again"
"We traveled in for just one night and this hotel was perfect for our needs. Parking was high, but we expected it. The service was very quick and friendly from everyone we encountered. Our room was large, great size for 2 adults, 2 kids, and a baby. Everyone had enough space to move around and be comfortable. Room was clean and beds slept well. We ordered Ginos East, just steps away from the hotel. All the shopping we planned was literally within a few blocks either way, great location for us to check off everything on our list."
"Stayed as a family and very pleased - very convenient location. Nearby water tower and most of the best stores. Not far from museums. We were shocked how large our room was - expecting much smaller. Clean room. Only complaint is $60 parking (although that's the case everywhere downtown) and the beds were small - I think doubles, not Queen size. However, very happy with our stay and would come back."
"Stayed on a very short turnaround for a work trip, so I can't speak to the amenities. But I have a soft spot for big old hotels that have had makeovers and will definitely be back. Staff was polite and helpful, bed was comfortable, and there was no noise from the street (room was on the 26th floor). Very central location, cabs and buses right out the door, and an El stop a couple of blocks away."
"We had a mother / daughter trip to Chicago, and booked at MileNorth, it was very upscale and the perfect location to lots of shopping on Michigan Ave, the hancock building, water tower mall. The staff was very friendly . we had a late night train ride booked and they kept our luggage all day until we were ready to leave. Right next door to Ginos Pizza too, a must stop for awesome Chicago style pizza. We will be staying here again!!!"
"I live in Chicago but on special occasions or family comes to visit, we stay in hotels around downtown Chicago. I have been to over a dozen, Mile North does not shape up. Not only are doors paper thin (we could hear everything in our hallway), the rooms do not keep noise out. We could hear our neighbors ALL night long. The beds made us wish to be back home, they are noisy and stiff and come with uncomfortable sheets and pillows. Also, our room we reserved 4 months in advanced, the hotel did not give us until the second night... due to giving it away to another guest who checked in before us. The first room we received was a smaller bed and some lamps did not work and neither did the fridge. The second room we received had the a/c and heat unit right next to the bed which would come on every hour blowing out either freezing air or hot hot air. The temperatures in both rooms were not accurate and we were either too cold or too hot. The people who work there are VERY nice and attentive, which is great... but when competing with all other Chicago Hotels, service is only one aspect. I will not be staying at Mile North again, nor will my friends or family. It is in a great location and while we didn't spend much time in our room, we were there to sleep... but didn't enjoy the little sleep we received.

"I have stayed here at the Milenorth twice and must compliment the staff on the great level of service. The rooms are clean and spacious, and the hotel is close to many of the attractions Chicago has to offer. I would definitely stay here again. However, on this, my second trip, I was charged a ""Hotel Services Fee."" When I asked what this fee is for, I was told it is for services like the ""free"" wireless and ... (i stopped listening right there). I certainly don't mind paying $4.95 for some services, but don't tell me these services are ""free"" if I then am assessed a fee for them. If you want to increase the room rates by $5, great - go ahead and do so and *then* say the services are free (or, rather, included). But don't do what you're doing. So my overall review: great hotel, but don't nickel and dime your guests!"
"Unfortunately an otherwise perfectly good hotel stay was soured for a friend and I last week. We enjoyed the facilities at the hotel, the bar, the food was great in the restaurant and the room was spacious to fit two double beds comfortably. Our room was cleaned to a great standard every day and the staff were helpful when called upon.The negative review comes from the deposit system. We were informed upon arrival (something which in itself is unacceptable, all fees should be clearly outlined prior to booking), that my card would be charged $60 for each day we were there, and assured it'd be refunded within 3 to 7 days of check-out.It is now 9 days since returning to the UK... no refund, no correspondence, no replies to THREE emails and surveys in which I clearly outlined my concerns. This is totally unacceptable. If a system like this cannot be managed effectively in all instances, whether you're US or UK based, it should not be employed in the first place. The last thing I wanted to do was write a negative review of the hotel, because the trip itself was excellent and the hotel was exactly what we wanted. I'm now $300 out of pocket and with no word of an explanation as to if or when this money will ever be refunded. It is not a situation I have ever found myself in, but I am looking to escalate the issue if I do not receive correspondence and my deposit immediately. If you are uncomfortable about leaving your card or paying for a deposit when you stay at a hotel then steer clear of this hotel, as they evidently cannot guarantee that your money will be effectively managed and refunded."
"I get to Chicago several times a year and have always stayed in the Loop. On a recent trip, I decided to try something different and ended up at MileNorth. I'm glad I did -- MileNorth will be my choice for future visits.The hotel is in a super location, just steps off of Michigan Avenue shopping. The lobby is welcoming, with comfortable seating and conversation areas. The registration desk is made from real suitcases and the attractive lobby bar/coffee shop is constructed from look like old library card catalog drawers. Staff are friendly, efficient and accomodating. Housekeeping is outstanding. My room was on the sixth floor (there are seven). Seeing it for the first time was a jaw-dropping experience. The room was huge and very well furnished. At one end, the bed with nightstands, a dresser, a chair with reading lamp, and on-the-wall TV. Toward the middle, a nice-size desk with good lights, another chair and small sofa, coffee table and a second wall-mounted TV. At the far end, clothes closet, refrigerator and coffee maker, and large, immaculate bathroom with walk-in shower (no tub). The hotel has a small, limited menu restaurant. (They plan to open a rooftop bar in spring 2014.) Buffet breakfast was tasty but pricey, as hotel breakfasts tend to be. I was more than pleased with MileNorth. To top it off, the price as about two-thirds of what I was accustomed to paying to stay in the Loop.In sum, MileNorth is a real find.

"I surprised my mother for her birthday with a mini-getaway in downtown Chicago for the weekend. I booked the double bedroom at the Mile North. We live in Chicago and work right around the corner from the property. Here's how it went.Check-in: We checked in about 3:45 pm. The front desk advised that I would be required to pay a $60 per day incidental fee. I said fine. She explained that I would receive it back on check-out in full or minus any purchases. It went smoothly without incidents. Our room was ready. Room: Our room 709 was nice. We didn't have a great few but, that was okay. It was cold and snowy anyway. We took a few minutes to look around before starting our evening. We had a mini-fridge which was nice. I had bought a bottle of champagne in my suitcase. The room was very clean. No tub but a walk-in shower. The bathroom was huge! Nice and spacious. We had a desk with a chair. Instead of having a night on the bedside table the night light was on each bed's headboard. I liked that so each person has their own night light. I also liked the long pillow on the bed that contains the hotel name and symbol. The room was really nice and clean. Our room was cleaned on Saturday by the cleaning staff. The room smelled so good when we came back. Not like cleaning supplies but a mild floral, springy scent.Bar: There's a bar in the lobby where you can also purchase bar food. This is where we met Manny, our friendly and fabulous bartender. We gave him our drink orders. He was very attentive and personable. He asked were we visitors or natives. I explained that we are natives and I was treating my mother for her birthday. He made her a special birthday drink. Don't remember what was in it besides tequila but it was very tasty. We met some other patrons and we had a nice time. During our bar visit we also met the night manager of the hotel, Danny. He didn't drink but, he did participate in some of the conversations. He was also nice and friendly. We stayed there until the bar closed at midnight. There's a rooftop lounge at this hotel but, it was closed for cleaning during our weekend stay. We also visited the bar on Saturday night. Manny already knew what we wanted to drink. He remembered from the previous night. Danny also came over again. We also made sure to say goodbye to him since we would be checking out in the morning.Food: There's a restaurant in the lobby that serves breakfast and lunch but we didn't eat there. We did order food from an outside restaurant. They don't have room service but, that's not a deal breaker for me. I knew that when I made the reservations. I liked that the front desk called the room to make sure that we had ordered food prior to letting up the delivery guy. That made me feel safe. Believe or not, all hotels don't do that. Check-out: Check out was at noon. Here you don't do your normal check out where everyone surrounds the desk. They slip your final bill under the door overnight. I like that. No need to go to the desk unless there's a problem with the bill. It also makes checking out a breeze.All in all we really enjoyed our stay. The staff was professional and friendly all the time. When you leave and need transportation the doorman hails you a taxi. Ginos East pizza place is right next door. The hotel is convenient to all Chicago Magnificent Mile has to offer. Within walking distance to shopping, restaurants, movie theatres, and even a hospital. We really enjoyed ourselves and would recommend Mile North to anyone looking for a reasonably price, conveniently located, clean, and friendly hotel. Mile North will not disappoint you and we will definitely be returning in the near future."
"This was our second stay at this hotel, and it was again exceptional. Great service, great location and the room was fantastic. You are right next to a bunch of shopping and the original Gino's East. The service is extremely friendly and accommodating as well. We got their suite again, which is spacious. There are some slightly different hotel policies I noticed - you have to be 21 to rent a room, they do not change your sheets / towels unless requested, no room service, the option of a $5 hotel credit if you don't get room service, and no wet bar or water in the room - but none effected us. I love the addition of the restaurant downstairs, they make a mean old fashioned."
"So... I have not actually stayed here, but the pictures look gorgeous and living in Chicago, I know this is an AWESOME location. However, I called them for a room donation for a charity event that I am attending this weekend. They were more than generous and I was so grateful. I will recommend this hotel to anyone looking to stay in Chicago as they were overly accommodating and so friendly. Service like this is hard to come by and that makes them top notch in my book!"
"We got a groupon deal so did not pay an arm and a leg to stay at this hotel. No matter what the price, it was great. Centrally located for tourism needs, we walked there from the El with our luggage and didn't need a car.The hotel is beautifully decorated (bathroom was exceptionally great with a full tub and sea rte huge shower) and the lobby encourages relaxing as it has a Starbucks and a bar/restaurant. The staff was great, especially Dan M, who went above and beyond helping guests during our stay. If you are traveling to Chicago check this out. We were able to walk to wonderful restaurants, the Hancock tower, and took cabs to every place else. Beautiful even in the frigid winter.

"My husband and I booked this hotel through expedia and thought it would be a wonderful ""luxurious"" king suite with a city view. We were assigned room 2408. The room was the first disappointment, the ""city view"" we paid extra for was basically impossible to see through the condensation (and later, frost) on the double pane windows. The suite was no bigger than a regular hotel room, there just had a bunch of wasted square footage by the door. There was a constant machine noise, presumably the compressors on tops of adjacent buildings, very noticeable from the bed area. The bathroom had no fan, and was right next to the bed- gross. The bed seemed small for a king. The staff was good and bad. We loved Joel at the door and Manny in the bar as well as breakfast staff but front desk staff left much to be desired. The customer service we enjoyed all over the city just never came to this front desk. I never felt that ""welcome"" feel. No room service, breakfast is buffet only NO MENU. Wifi was never able to connect. Overall, it was a disappointment and we will look for a more tried and true hotel in the future.

"My husband and I stayed here on a Saturday night before a Bears game. We like to do a lot of shopping while in the city, so this was a perfect location. It's on a quiet side street a half a block off from the Magnificent Mile and within walking to tons of restaurants. We booked through groupon and got a great deal, and check in was super quick and easy. They also let us keep our bags there after check out so we still go and do things before and after the game. The modern rooms are very clean and spacious, and the beds are comfy. We stayed in the streeterville king which didn't have a great view,but that's not something that's important to us while in Chicago. Overall a perfect stay!Also, parking is $58/ day which is pretty comparable, so we also park at the grant park garages after dropping off our bags and take a cab back. It's much cheaper!"
"Stayed at the Mile North for six nights on a birthday trip to see the Blackhawks play. I travel often for work and pleasure and rate my hotels by cleanliness and friendliness. You can get the star rating from many places but your need this to find out this hotel is very clean, comfortable and the staff were very helpful from check in, to directions, to food recommendations. The location is exceptional for shopping, getting the train and going out to eat. This is not the Hilton but for home away feel and value it was spectacular."
"My husband and I celebrated our 1 year wedding anniversary by spending a weekend back at Mile North since we had the start to our honeymoon weekend a year ago here! We're so glad we came back. The hotel was completely remodeled since we'd last stayed and it looked great! We didn't book a Magnificent Mile room (wish we did!) like last year but we loved our stay anyways. Our room was very clean and always taken care of. We really love the location of this hotel. Water Tower Place is a few minutes away (walking) and you're around some very good restaurants and more shopping (again all within walking). The front desk staff always greeted us when we were coming and going and couldn't have been nicer. Thank you for having us for our anniversary! We really love this hotel. We will definitely be back (again!)

"I loved this hotel so much, I decided it's my pick for all future Chicago trips. It's a charming boutique hotel with a great vibe and an exceptionally warm and helpful staff. You cannot beat the location, a half block off of N. Michigan and just a block and a half from Water Tower Place. Also right next door to Gino's East, for tourists who have to try the famous pizza.Given the location, this hotel could probably charge double and halve the quality, and they would still get plenty of business. But the quality is really stellar, and the rate I paid was inexplicably low (although I did pre-pay weeks in advance, and the price went up 50% between then and my stay). The lobby is cozy and relaxed with boho decor, a surprisingly big cafe hidden in the back, and a nice bar to one side. There is also a small rooftop bar on the 29th floor, open during the summer. The decor is trendy but not annoyingly so. I didn't use the gym but I had a look and it was well equipped. Every staff person was great - special thanks to Anne at the front desk and the really nice doorman hailing taxis for us in the bitter cold.My room was one with a sunken level, where you descend a few steps from the bathroom/valet area to the bed. It was spacious, comfortable, and clean, with a great bed, fantastic pillows, and a good size TV. My only gripe is that the towels are terrible quality, not plush at all, but thin and dingy like gym towels. But honestly for how wonderful everything else was during my stay, I am not complaining."
"Everything about this hotel is wonderful!  The staff was extremely nice, friendly & professional. The room: An ideal Chicago view (rm 411). It was very nicely appointed and large - including the bathroom! The beds are very comfortable and the bedding is of good quality. Most importantly, it was very very clean (the maids don't miss a spot of dust). The elevators and hallways were well kept and bright .The lobby style is eclectic - fun & funky. We had brunch at Ferris & Jack's (lobby bar/restaurant) and they have a small but well thought out menu. Location: The hotel is just down the block from Michigan and next door to Gino's East. Perfect location for anything on the north end of the Gold Coast."
"Excellent hotel. Operated like a first class hotel should. Great location just off Michigan Ave. rooms are very clean and comfortable. We had a problem with a toilet. Talked with Hilary, the manager on duty, who worked hard to insure that we were relocated to a very nice room and the balance of the stay we were satisfied. The entire staff, from front desk to bellmen to housekeeping we're upbeat and friendly. Overall, a very nice experience.

"Just steps from Michigan Avenue and next to Neiman Marcus AND Gino's famous deep dish (Jon Stewart went off on this iconic Chicago pizza) is the Mile North hotel.Small hotel featuring a small restaurant, Starbucks and cute little pastries sold in the lobby. Fireplace, plenty of comfortable seating makes the lobby a nice place to hang out on a crummy day.Rooms are lovely and classically appointed, thick towels....just a lovely experience.If you are looking for a great experience while you are staying in Chicago, look no further.

"Stayed here again for a short visit. Lobby and restaurant area has been redone since I was here last. It has a very eclectic new lobby. I liked the new addition of the coffee bar, snacks and drink selections in the lobby area. I was upgraded to a queen suite, very nice to have the extra room. The new restaurant Ferris & Jack is still very good and reasonably priced for breakfast. Only one small problem with noisy guests in room next door late at night. I called the front desk and they seemed to resolve the problem but took about 45 minutes. Other than the noise, which I have never experienced here before, it was a great stay.Staff very friendly and accommodating. Again great location if you want to be up north off of Michigan Ave. Nice hotel!

I've never heard of such a thing. Most nice hotels gladly do early check ins when available & never charge.All desk people, doormen, bartenders - very niceLoved decor of rooms, lots of nice touches- Chicago themed shower curtains, nice lighting by bed& great lobby"
"This hotel is conveniently located in the middle of the Magnificent Mile where there are many shopping and dining options nearby. It's about 15 minutes walk from the subway station (I emailed the hotel prior to arrival and promptly received a very detailed email giving me directions from the station), and the neighbourhood was quite safe. The hotel must have had a recent update as the lobby and rooms were very modern, both very clean. The check-in staff was very friendly and check-in process was very quick without any hassles. The room was quite spacious for big city hotels, and the bed and pillows were very comfortable. The only downsides where that ice machine was only available at certain floors, and the wifi signal in my room was quite poor, possibly due to the room location.Overall I had a great stay at the MileNorth, and I would recommend it to anyone visiting Chicago. Make sure you also check out Nordstrom Rack for some incredible bargains!"
"If you're in Chicago and find good enough hotel whether for business for holiday, Mile North will do. It's located just round the corner of Michigan ave. Just behind Disney Store and 1 block away from Apple stores. Hershey store, Ghiralldeli, Cheese factory, John Hancock building just 5-10 min walk away..However the room is relatively small and no breakfast, eventhough there's Starbuck counter downstair."
"We stayed at the Mile North for the first time. We had a nice quiet, spacious room on the 22nd floor street side. The hotel was clean and very accommodating staff. Everyone was friendly.They have a restaurant in the hotel, as well as a lobby bar...we didn't get a chance to eat there.The location of the hotel is 1 block off of Michigan and we took the subway in from O'Hare...the red line is a short walk which was very convenient. I would recommend this hotel due to the cleanliness, employees, and the location."
"Booked 3 nights. They had attractive rates, and we liked the location. Here's the good things first:Excellent location, in the middle of Magnificient Mile. We were able to walk everywhere, all the way down to the loop and back, no problem.The loft suite we got was great, good size, nice layout.We got a high floor, but it didn't matter much, as there are taller buildings all around so not much of a view.All the staff we met were marvelous. From bell hop, to check in, to check out.Here's the not-so-good:The cleanliness of the washroom was just short. First day there was a slight 'smell', like maybe the mop they used wasn't very clean. Not a major problem, so we didn't reported it, and certainly didn't want to change rooms once we unpacked. It got better on the 2nd and 3rd night.Also, the cleaners let the toilet paper run low and didn't change the roll nor provide an extra roll. By the 3rd day we were out! Had to use the facial tissue, or else would have had to call for help! I've never seen such carelessness in all the hotels I've stayed at.The bed was terrible, it sank in the middle. We had a terrible sleep on the 1st night, and got used to it gradually the following nights. We figured this was one thing they didn't upgrade in their renovations, so again just decided to live with it. Wasn't until we moved to the next hotel, the Hyatt Place in Naperville, that we realized how bad the bed here was (Yes, the Hyatt House was EXCELLENT. See my review).Lots of good things going for this hotel, and I would recommend it, especially if you find a good rate. The cleaning staff, well, You go to the next floor and it may be a differnet experience, so not a big deal. But the bed is a high priority item in my book, and because they didn't do well in that, I could only give it a 3 star. I don't believe the Expedia rating of 4 stars for this hotel is quite right either. Perhaps a 3.5 in my opinion.


Room Tip: High Floor not very important. The Queen Suite Loft is good size and good layout.

"There's so much to really like about this hotel, but each time I come back to stay I can't help but think, ""man I miss the old Affinia Hotel Chicago days."" Especially the pillow menu that Affinia used to offer.The location of the MileNorth is straight up AWESOME. 1/2 a block from Michigan Ave on a fairly quiet street, right next to Gino's East, so close to many other sightseeing, shopping and eating opportunities.The rooms are fairly spacious, but there is an inconsistency between the room experiences. Some have really nice bathrooms with sunken tubs, others make you feel like you're staying at a Holiday Inn, and could use some definite updates.I will say that I LOVE the updates that have been made to the lobby area, the redesign definitely opens up the space more, and the addition of the bar and coffee area is great. The elevators are still pretty slow though.While this is still a fairly good hotel, it has fallen on my list of favs in Chicago. Hopefully there are more updates to the MileNorth in the near future."
Great location and very spacious suites although we didn't have any blinds or curtains in our room which made us feel a bit exposed! My brother and his wife had a suite on a higher floor which was magnificent with a sunken bath and walk in shower. As we were only staying there for 1 night we didn't get a chance to use the roof top patio bar which looked fabulous. Only downside was they couldn't get us out quick enough on day of departure.
"The hotel is well equipped, and the rooms are very nice. I was on the 27th floor but facing away from Superior Street (room 2704) which meant that I was looking at the office building next door. If you want city views, then ask for a high room facing Superior. The location of the hotel is excellent - very near Michigan Avenue and a short walk to most central attractions. There is also a good restaurant (Ferris and Jack) on the ground floor - which has a good selection of drinks and food. On the downside - the reception staff are some of the most miserable I've encountered. Even the simplest of questions (such as check out time) seemed like a terrible burden to them. I would have expected a better standard of service from this type of hotel. In addition, the walls to the rooms are very thin. I was woken early every day by the cleaners having loud conversations in the hallway.

"Hotel number four on my Great Rail trip from LA to New York. I absolutely loved Chicago for its architecture, culture, transport system and its people. The hotel is located off the ""Magnificent Mile"", the trendy north side of the city with big name stores (and big prices) nearby. My room 609 was huge for just one person, and if it had a kitchen, it would be a smart city apartment. There was a king size bed, sofa, armchair, two TVs, fridge, safe, coffee machine etc. and a large bathroom with shower big enough to accommodate a close friend or two!! My only criticism of the room was that it looked across to a skyscraper which kept a lot of natural light out, and there was inadequate lighting to compensate. Nevertheless, it is a smart hotel and the food and service were very good. There is a bar on the top floor (number 29 I think) from which good views can be had.The public transport system in Chicago, the CTA, is also very good. A 24-hour travel card costs just $10 from a nearby supermarket (Walgreens), and a trip on THE LOOP (The EL) is a must. I would definitely like to see more of Chicago; in fact I much preferred it to New York, my final stop on this epic journey.


Room Tip: Try to get a room as high as possible for better views.

"The hotel is in a good location for shopping, restaurants, Lake Michigan etc. The room and bathroom was large, clean and nicely decorated. Unfortunately the views were not that great for a city view room (I was on floor 12) but there was no noise from the city (apart from the evening storm!). The staff were very helpful and polite and I couldn't have asked for more. Gino's pizza, two doors away, has the most amazing pizza I have ever tasted so I recommend trying that - go for deep pan! I would definitely stay here again and I would recommend to others.


Room Tip: Try a high floor room for city views

"Stayed one night. The rooftop lounge is very fun with a good view of the city. Lots of restaurants in the area. I booked the room directly through the hotel service and was given an upper level floor room for the same price as the lower level rooms. The reservationist was VERY nice,helpful and knowledgeable regarding information on Chicago. Yes, there is a charge for valet parking but it is worth it. You have unlimited in/out privileges. This is very common for Chicago hotels. There IS a parking ramp kitty corner to the hotel across the street though but I don't know the rates. Also there is a children's hospital next door so they may have available parking. The beds were very comfortable and there was a mini-fridge (no extra charge) and no annoying honor bar.


Room Tip: Call the hotel directly to book your room and you may get a free upgrade.

I stayed at the MileNorth after purchasing a night from Hotwire. The hotel is located just east of Michigan on Superior. I often forget about hotels in this area. Plenty of shopping and restaurants in the area. The hotel room was large and very comfortable. The hotel lobby is interesting with a Starbucks/breakfast bar in the morning that turns to a Bar in the evening. Overall nice place and I will go back..
"Great location, friendly staff and a good night's sleep what more do you want? Yes there were few minor cosmetic issues in the bathroom that should be attended to but the room was modern, and clean and the beds were comfortable. I always love rooms that included a mini-refrigerator. So we went around the corner and picked up drinks and snacks to have the next day. Especially, convenient for visiting the American Girl Place. The rooftop bar was really nice and I regret that we didn't have time to enjoy it since the weather was unusually nice for the end of July.My husband really liked having a recliner in the room. I liked having the split level - it really was unique for a hotel room. Just don't trip at night finding the bathroom. ;)"
"My friend and I spent 2 nights here in July as a girls' getaway. We had a room on the 5th floor facing an alley. Couldn't get the shade to pull up, so we had to have it closed the whole time, which was a bummer, since we're sun-lovers! I loved how large the room was (which is especially nice when sharing with a friend as opposed to a partner), and the bathroom was huge for a downtown hotel. We found the ""Jetsons"" beds to be funky, but not luxuriously comfortable. Comfy beds are pretty huge on my list, and these were just ok. There were a lot, and I mean, a LOT of black, curly hairs on the throw pillows on my bed (I took pictures), which pretty much grossed me out. I expect a high level of cleanliness and attention to detail when I'm paying a premium for a good location. The rest of the room was clean, but the kick boards on the floor as well as the ceiling are already showing some serious wear and tear. I think more than anything, the rooms suffer from a bit of aesthetic confusion. As if they want to be modern and interesting, yet don't really hit the mark; mixing random colors and textures with an overall sense of minimalism. Nothing felt very cohesive in terms of design, but if you don't care about that, it's a fabulous location for a reasonable price. We enjoyed the rooftop bar and deck for about 10 minutes before it closed (we were the only ones there, and to be fair, it was 11:45 on a Monday night), and probably would have gone back, but with no drink happy hour, found the prices to be a little prohibitive. Parking in the area is a pain (to be expected in downtown Chicago), and the valet is pricey. We opted to park in a cheaper part of town for the bulk of the day, then moved our car to the side streets off the hospital next door where you can park for free from midnight to 8am. A huge hassle if you are there to sleep in, but we were up and about each morning, so not a big deal for us. Staff is very friendly and helpful, cafe in the lobby was a nice perk, and seriously, this hotel is walkable to everything. For the money, I'd probably spend a bit more and try something else next time, but wouldn't hesitate to recommend the Mile North to other travelers.


Room Tip: There are 2 banks of rooms. I think anything above the 7th floor is probably a better bet for view.

"I had a split-level room on the 26th floor, with modern decor, that was spotlessly clean. All of the staff that I encountered were exceptionally attentive & friendly (from the Doormen, to the Front Desk staff, the Bellhop & the morning Barista in the Lobby). I was in Chicago for testing at Northwestern Hospital & the location was very exceedingly convenient (since the Northwestern Hospital is basically located across the street from the hotel). I will definately stay here again & will certainly recommend the hotel to my friends."
"Clean and modern with a nice bar, decent restaurant (or if you want pizza, it's next door to Gino's East ). The rooms are above average in size and are well furnished in a modern mode. The staff was uniformly nice and the location is excellent - it's a block from Michigan Ave, a block from Water Tower Place, and 3 1/2 blocks from the EL. There was nothing to criticize on a recent stay, but nothing to rave about, either."
"This week was my first stay at a Hard Rock hotel property. I am a loyal Marriott customer but couldn't get into any of their properties in Chicago this week. I selected the Hard Rock pretty much by chance. I thoroughly enjoyed my stay. The staff was extremely courteous, the rooms clean and the location is right in the heart of everything. The hotel was fully booked yet I never felt that things were all that hectic or out of control. I recommend the Hard Rock in Chicago to anyone looking for a great hotel experience."
"Hard Rock Hotel in Chicago has a great location on the very South end of the Miracle Mile and about 1 block from Millennium Park. This is right in the heart of downtown Chicago. 2 blocks from the ""L"", 2 blocks from Intelligence Coffee, 1 block from the Chicago river, 2 blocks from awesome shopping and restaurants....can't really ask for a more convenient location.The people who work there are FRIENDLY! Very! The price is very reasonable and the building is a famous structure out side and very modern inside.My only complaint this from this trip is that the shower needed some slight mildew removal and could use a better shower head in the shower.I've stayed here many times now and as before...it ROCKED me once again!


Room Tip: NE and NW facing rooms may have river view

"We stayed here over a weekend in April and found the location perfect. Staff were great and the standard rooms are very big. Hotel decor is very cool, even the outside is green terra cotta and gold! We went for a walk and bumped into 'the bean' just around the corner. We bought a hop on hop off tour pass and one of the stops is just a block away from the hotel. Very convenient. Walking distance to great shopping on magnificent mile."
"We stayed at the Hard Rock this past weekend for our wedding anniversary. I have to say the very best thing about this hotel is the location. I really do not think you can do better on location for this price.The outside of the hotel is beautiful and easy to identify when you are walking around. The lobby is small but very cool and has a great energy to it. The ping pong table was in use nearly every time we went by it. It seemed like a weird thing to have in a hotel lobby, but was really fun to see people laughing and having a good time with it! The furniture in the lobby is super cool and comfortable. The check-in staff was efficient, friendly and when we arrived about an hour early had no problem getting us in to our room. We really appreciated that!The bar was nice, the drinks were pricey but strong and the DJ playing really made it enjoyable to hang out in there. The service was hit or miss on friendliness, it was never over the top great but never horrible either. It was kind of bummer when trying to order a Cucumber martini from the specialty cocktail menu that they didn't have the supplies to make it. Find a new recipe or remove it from the menu, it sounded like this drink had been unavailable for quite a while, not just this weekend.Now...the room. Ugh! We were really excited to be spending our anniversary weekend at the Hard Rock, but the room was in a condition that I can't imagine they are willing to put their brand on. The colorful touches you see in the pictures on the website were totally missing. The lamp was stained. I can't even imagine how the lampshade was stained in this way, but it did not give me a feeling of cleanliness. It wasn't even plugged in, maybe in hopes we wouldn't turn it on and notice? The bathroom door was water damaged. The bathroom grout was dingy and gray. I feel like (hope) that this was more of a worn out issue than a cleanliness issue, but it evoked a feeling of not wanting to go in to the shower barefoot for sure. I thought it was great that they had a magnification mirror installed, but the light on it wasn't in working order. The mini-fridge was empty of any snacks or drinks, this was okay with me though as I then avoided the temptation to pay $7 dollars for a Snickers bar and that gave us a small fridge to use instead. A decorative decal on the wall was starting to peel off on the edges. This was DEF not the cool/hip Hard Rock experience we were hoping for. The beds and pillows were comfortable and provided a good nights sleep. The linens were clean and comfortable and we were happy for that.If you are in Chicago to see the city and want a truly excellent location for a great price and don't care about the room, this might be the hotel for you! We got a great deal on the room and I think it was the least expensive in this prime area for site-seeing. We could walk to 'The Bean' easily and never had a taxi ride that cost over 10 dollars (pre-tip) to anywhere we wanted to go. IF you are in Chicago for a romantic getaway and DO care about the condition of the room, you may want to skip the Hard Rock."
"I would not pay over 200 for this hotel! I got an extremely amazing deal through groupon, otherwise I would not have stayed here! I saw in reviews it was run down but I didn't think so... My room was very spacious and it didn't look worn out at all! The check in was 3 but we got there early and got to check in at 10 am, that was a huge plus in my book. The room definitely could've been cleaner. I found ""skid"" marks on my sheets and the furniture was greasy. And one thing that really made me upset was a man working at the hotel with a foreign accent came knocking on our door at 9:00 am and yelling something we could not make out and then just let himself in!!! I personally thought it was very rude! The bartender did not know much about making drinks. The atmosphere of this hotel is amazing ,the staff were really friendly, the room was really nice, like I said could've been cleaner and the location was good. I would probably stay again if I got a good deal!"
"My husband, daughter and myself stayed here for a family vacation. We stayed for five nights it was incredible. The location was amazing we only took a taxi one time otherwise we were able to walk everywhere we even walked to shedds about 2 miles but a lot to look at! There are a lot of closer thing s too only about 2 blocks from mellinium park which is incredible!! The staff was wonderful smiling faces and always pleasant. Defiantly going to stay here every trip to Chicago room was awesome. Every aspect of the hotel from the service to the different things to look at made our vacation wonderful. They also do guitar rentals but the kicker is you have to have a 500 dollar deposit which they refund when you return the guitar but still have to have the deposit. Loved it!!!"
"My husband and I stayed here for two nights with our two children (one being an infant). We were upgraded (twice) and wound up with a Platinum Queen room, which we were very grateful for. There was a building being constructed outside our window. We enjoyed watching the construction, but it may have bothered couples, or other families that don't have construction enthusiasts. We liked the location of the hotel. There were many restaurants nearby and we could see Millennium Park from our window. We used the transit system while in town and the concierge was very helpful in getting us on the right bus, which wasn't that difficult from the hotel.Overall, the room was clean, the staff was outstanding, and we were very happy that we chose the Hard Rock for our family vacation."
"Extremely well located for walking around the best parts of Chicago. From this hotel, we were able to easily walk up to the Water Tower, over to Navy Pier, Millennium Park and into the South Loop district for deep dish pizza!Only drawback is the high parking rates for storing your vehicle.The hotel was clean, the atmosphere funky and the staff was very hospitable.Overall, a very enjoyable weekend stay. Highly recommended!"
"I can't give it five stars because it didn't meet expectations. A name like Hard rock should inspire perfection. Why not perfect? First what was good: people. Very friendly and helpful staff. Concierge directed us to great breakfast, desk staff recommended using ell to get to midway rather than a cab (good call), room service delivered a glass of wine one evening very happily, room service breakfast was awesome (eggs Benedict for son, scrambled eggs for me) neat memorabilia throughout. Room good sized, bed comfortable, room quiet. Ideal location. ..steps from millenium park, state street, public transport to major attractions. Ping pong in lobby. South water kitchen around corner. Just loved location. Here is my criticism: they're was no room service menu nor hotel amenities binder in room and we asked four separate times. Asked concierge on way out, nothing. Asked front desk about it, as well as mini bar restock, mini bar was restocked but no binder. Called room service and got copy of breakfast menu delivered, finally called again and got full menu delivered. But never got hotel directory binder. 2nd criticism: strong sulfurous/rotten egg odor when we came back after shopping first day, which dissapated but horrible smell (like stale poop) lingered. We febreezed bathroom every time we walked in but never solved it. Didn't complain because didn't figure it mattered as room was fine. 3rd minor thing: only 2 towels left last day. Would I stay again? Yes if price was right . But more than $130/night I'm going somewhere else."
"We stayed here the other evening for a quick get away. We arrived an hour before check-in and they didn't hassle us at all. We got a room and were able to go right up. The room was large, and so was the bathroom. Beds were comfy and they were very clean. The hotel was very quiet for being a holiday weekend with lots of stuff going on in Chicago that weekend. It's in a great location to be able to get taxi's or within a quick walking distance to pretty much anything you would want."
"My husband and I stayed here for three nights! Its in a good location, lots of places to eat close by and we enjoyed the short walk to the main places. We had a room with a king size bed, it was very clean, but the room was pretty small. The bed was comfortable and you have a coffee pot in the room. There is no refrigerator that you can use or microwave. The bathroom was very small! There is no way two people can try and get ready at the same time...which was a problem for us! There is also a safe in the room! The staff was very nice and the hotel was very modern! All in all, we would stay here again!"
"The Hard Rock has proved to be an excellent choice for a father soon trip to Chicago. The location is great, on Michigan Avenue just between the Loop and the Magnificent Mile.The hotel is a beautiful historic sky scraper but it is just starting to show tiredness following its 2004 opening, a refurbishment (at least of the standard rooms) is needed. Front desk and housekeeping were good and non intrusive and because we were here for so long we were offered free internet access. Overall the Hard Rock Hotel is very good and if you can get a good rate then it is recommended but be aware there are better choices out there."
"My boyfriend and I wanted a place to stay for a weekend get away and thought this place would be different yet perfect for the location and just for the experience. I have to say, it was not worth it. Our room wasn't ready for 3 hours. Yes they gave us complimentary drinks at chucks (which is a great restaurant by the way), but we had reservations for dinner to go to later on the night which we had to change. They also offered us another room, but for 2 queen size beds when I paid for a king size bed room, I didn't accept. But when we finally got to ours room, it was still not worth the stay. The lampshade was damaged in our room and fridge had missing beverages, which I mentioned to the front desk just so I wasn't charged, which he said I won't be. While checking my balances on my statements after staying there, I was charged. I still haven't gotten my money back. It was frustrating and definitely not worth my money. While calling I was also handed over to 3 different associates and all gave me different stories about why I was charged. While I thought the workers were friendly, I didn't think they were very professional. I recommend staying somewhere else in the city of Chicago."
"I had several problems:1. I was not asked if I needed help with my luggage.2. The dresser in my room was damaged on both sides.3. The tile on my bathroom floor was loose.4. Room Service was closed on a Friday night and when I asked front desk about it, I was told to walk to 7/11 to get something to eat.5. I was locked out of my room at least 30 minutes prior to check out and had to wait several minutes causing me to check out 20 minutes late. -As a result of being locked out, I missed my train and was delayed 5 hours. I also had to pay a $45 charge when I traded my ticket in after missing my original train.-When I called and complained, Will was not apologetic. He blamed me for the key not working. He said that I must have had it with my credit cards.-After getting no where with Will, I asked for the corporate number, he told me that I could call corporate but they are not going to do anything to help me, so I should just talk to him."
"The Hard Rock in Chicago is an excellent location. Just south of the Chicago river and one block away from the magnificent mile makes this hotel the perfect location. There are many restaurants and shopping within a short walking distance. The hotel itself is clean, comfortable and the staff is friendly. I would recommend booking parking ahead of time as the hotel does offer parking however, it is 60 dollars per day and you can find better rates if you are willing to walk a few blocks. Wifi is available however there is a charge per night per device. I asked and the front desk gave me complimentary Wifi for two devices. I would definitely recommend this hotel."
"For the second portion of our trip, I decided to stay at the Hard Rock Hotel Chicago for a third time. As you may know, many of the floors of this hotel have a musician theme. The first time, I stayed on the AC/DC floor. The second was the Elvis floor. This time, we ended up on the B.B. King floor. (I'm still holding out for the Cheap Trick floor, having seen them in concert back home in Fort Wayne last summer.)Much of what I mentioned from my previous review two years ago still stands. The service is still excellent, and I have to give a nod to Zack at the front desk for checking us out in a fast manner so we could make our train back to Indiana on-time. The rooms are still very clean and spacious, and there's now some new fun touches like a shag pillow. The beds are still some of the best that I have slept on in a hotel. The shower experience was still great, with good water pressure, great toiletries, and thick towels. There's still a Keurig in the room - remember, if you have a certain kind of K-Cups that you like, you can use them.But I'd like to touch on three new subjects. The first one is Chuck's at breakfast. Last time I was here, I had lunch there, and I decided to try them for breakfast. I had an amazing melt-in-your-mouth waffle, and my father had the Red Velvet Pancakes that he loved, too. The second is their on-site gym, which I used for the first time on this visit. It's small, but it makes up for the size with really good equipment like high-tech treadmills and Nautilus systems. Spa services are also available, but I didn't use them. The third is Verizon reception. Last time I was here, I had AT&T, and Ma Bell's reception was perfect, while my mother had good results with Sprint as well. But Verizon's reception here requires you to be near a window to get good call quality. I just wanted to give this as a public service announcement for all the Verizon users.Overall, this was another great visit to the Hard Rock Hotel. Will I be back for a fourth time? You can bet on it."
"This was my first time staying at a Hard Rock Hotel and it was an awesome experience. Friendly staff, clean rooms, and a great location for tourists. The concierge were great at filling us in with all of the local places to go and things to do. Parking was confusing if you didn't use the valet service but, it was still a great distance from the hotel. I will definitely be staying again.


Room Tip: If you need help with finding your way around ask the concierge ! They were great !

"By the photos you'd assume it was close to immaculate but it is not. I booked a King Tower room, which is a king size bed in a bi-level room I suppose but the one I was given was not impressive. The bed was a full/queen and it was less than 2ft from the door. There were 3 steps down into an area with a couch and a table (?), just a poor design all around yet the hotel staff, with big bright smiles assured me I'd love it. I didn't love it and they kindly changed me to another room immediately. Although the bathrooms in both rooms were just fantastic, the wear and tear on the hotel is noticeable. Expected better from the Hard Rock but I guess 4 star ratings don't mean much anymore. Staff and location was excellent by the way, close to many restaurants and just steps away from the shops on Michigan ave.


Room Tip: Don't fall for the Tower rooms, especially on the 36th floor.

"My boyfriend and I stayed there for St. Patrick's weekend. It was abnormally warm so we tried to turn the AC on. To our surprise, they had not turned their coolers on so there was no AC. We had to crack the window. Then at night it gets cold so we turn the heat on, but the electric heat had not been on in about a year, per the engineer, and it was burning the dust off which caused a horrible smell and the fire alarm to go off. Needless to say, do not stay there during this time of the year. Not worth what we paid."
"My fiance and I stayed here for a date night. We arrived Saturday afternoon, went up to the room and then went to dinner. The floors each have a theme. We were on the Elvis floor in a corner room. When we got off the elevator, it smelled like pot a little, but we are young so that didn't bother us. We were able to take 5 minute cabs every where because it was chilly this weekend! It is in a great location. We went down to the bar for a drink and also went to the gift shop to get some stuff for our family. The rooms are smaller, but cozy! We loved the theme of our room and our king size bed was perfect for us! We took a cab to RPM and to the beach to go watch the Polar Plunge. It was fun!"
"Went to Chicago for a couple of days with my 10 year old daughter. We really enjoyed this hotel! It is in a great location off of Michigan Ave, we walked to everything. The staff was very helpful and friendly. The housekeeper on the 7th floor was so nice to my daughter and greeted us in the hallway overtime we went to our room. We had a corner room with a great view of the water and street. The room was nice and spacious for Chicago and clean. We also loved that you could have an electric guitar delivered to the room for free and play ping pong in the lobby.


Room Tip: There is construction going on across the street. Starting at 7:30am. Had a corner room and never...

"My husband and I stayed in room 1104 the weekend before Christmas. BEAUTIFUL corner room! We were celebrating my 40th birthday that weekend and had an amazing time. Room was clean. The first night I was woken up by the person next door blasting music, after two hours ( Don't want to be the old woman next door complaining) but I called down to front desk and with in a few minutes someone was up to our floor knocking on their door. So why do I give a one star rating when everything was great? I brought my VERY EXPENSIVE leather jacket that weekend. When I unpacked I hung it in the closet. The day we were checking out we woke up late and rushed to get packed so we could check out on time. Now...I used to be in the hotel business, so it's really important to have guests check out on time because of the time it takes to clean rooms. Well, I rushed so fast to be a good guest that I had totally forgot to grab my leather jacket out of the closet. I called a few days later AND WOULD YOU BELIEVE housekeeping hadn't found anything.....gee. I used to find gold watches and jewelry way more expensive then my jacket and I always turned it in. I will never stay at this hotel or any other Hard Rock. If this is the staff you hire and trust then I want NO PART OF IT.Happy friggen 40th birthday to me! Had that jacket for years! GONE! In one failed attempt to be on time. Lesson learned."
"We booked one night at this hotel to follow an event in Chicago. We had to valet the car- it was pricey at 60.00- but good till 5pm the next day. Super helpful concierge, desk guys and car, baggage guys. The room was sparse but comfortable. Looked a little worn out. Great view of the river though. If you are a Hard Rock Rewards member you get points and later check out which was a plus. The hotel in Chicago does not have a Hard Rock restaurant attached but does have a nice shop."
"last weekend we had a stay at the hard rock hotel chicago and i would like to say it was good. the room was comfortable with comfy beds, but found a few glitches (didn't really bother me)...lights sconces between the beds were loose and and the fridge was not stocked with pop...didn't feel like getting tipsy that night. the bathroom was nice and well appointed with lots of towels and toiletries by rock spa. the lobby was small and nicely furnished with groovy chairs and even a ping pong table while you wait. the angel and king bar was dark...a bit dark and felt it was more of a cougar bar (no offense) and found it was not a place for hip younger people to hang out in (i think it was the sub-freezing temperatures outside keeping them away)...the history of the building is unique and the black granite tiles on the outside were all pulled off and replaced in better condition after an expensive refurbishment. the 1929 built tower top has the crown covered in a thin layer of 24 karat gold leaf and looks, as popular legend says (from the book in the room)...connects the design of the building to a champagne bottle, with the terra cotta exterior corresponding to the green glass bottle and the golden tower alluding to the shiny foil top. each floor of the hotel represents each rock star we have and do know of...some floors, like ours were left in its original 1930's condition feeling like an office worker when we walked out onto the 13th floor for our room

"I stayed here for a weekend getaway with my sisters and mother in-law. Julie upgraded us since we were celebrating a special occasion and we were on the 19th floor with an amazing city view. I love that this hotel offers two queen beds instead of two double beds- it's helpful when you're sleeping next to friends and not your spouse! It was also very clean which is very important. We used a Groupon for this weekend and it was an amazing deal for the type of hotel we were looking for. Fantastic location right on Michigan Ave and the front desk staff were friendly and down to earth. I liked it so much that I'm coming back with my husband next weekend. Thanks, Julie!"
"During this past weekend I had the pleasure of staying two nights at the Hard Rock Hotel in Chicago, IL. I enjoyed it very much. The atmosphere is amazing along with the architecture and style of the whole hotel. I would suggest this hotel for anyone staying in Chicago for even one night. The rooms are awesome, the views are great, the staff is friendly and the hotel is in a perfect location. Not to mention the bar is great! Don't think twice about it, rock out and book your stay if you want a night to Remer remember."
"Stayed between Aug 8 & 11, 2014. Couple.Flew in from Toronto and ended up being quite early (10am) for check in (3pm). We checked in and left our bags with the hotel and they advised they would give us a call when a room was ready. Toured around and grabbed lunch (deep dish pizza) and received a call around 11:30am advising our room was ready. Our room was on the 18th floor (Lenny Kravitz). Room wasn't anything spectacular. Typical hotel room layout. Bed was large and comfortable. Washroom could be larger, but no real complaints. Only real thing to watch is on the dresser there is a weight sensitive tray with snacks that when items removed, are charged to your credit card. Same goes with the fridge. I knocked over something and called downstairs to inform them I didn't eat anything and they told me you have approx. 10 seconds to put it back with no charge. I was charged and they made note of my call and I didn't see the charge upon checkout. There is wifi in the room which was nice. We used the business center to surf online and print our return flight details. There is a lounge/bar downstairs that we went to once, it was ok. It wasn't busy when we went though. Only issue (if you would call it that) was that our floor's ice machine didn't work and neither did the one below or above. We had to go two floors down or up. Not a biggie, just annoying. We advised the front desk and they ended up sending up ice in a bucket and told us to call when we needed it, which was nice. You can't beat the location of the hotel. Right smack in the middle of downtown Chicago, easy access to transit, stadiums and tourist attractions. Overall, if we went to Chicago again, we would definitely stay at the Hard Rock again. Great place to stay."
"DO NOT GO HERE FOR NEW YEAR'S EVE! Do NOT buy a party ticket and do NOT stay in a room for the night! The rooms are outdated and the staff was completely overwhelmed. Our safety was in jeopardy.To start the night, my group of eight friends and I were forced to wait outside for 25 minutes at 9:30 in order to 'check in' to the event; a ridiculous notion, considering an email from your promotional organization was sent the day before advising women to ""only bring a coat if you really need one"", and the temperature outside was below 15 degrees. Why did you not suggest all guests bring a warm winter jacket, as they would be required to stand outside in the freezing cold for 20-30 minutes?When we entered the hotel for the party, the venue was a logistical nightmare. There were no easily visible signs pointing us where to go, mobs of people everywhere, and no staff members to help regulate traffic and answer questions. Why was there such little direction for patrons? Why was is that you did not have knowledgeable personnel or large signs to help party goers?The alcoholic drinks were absolutely unacceptable. The drinks were made by inexperienced bartenders (one had to ask me what was in the drink I ordered), made with watered down ingredients, and were served in extremely small plastic ""shooter"" cups that were barely filled 3/4 of the way. Why were drinks not made a priority for your staff? Why did we need to wait in line for 5-10 minutes EACH TIME we wanted a drink? Why was there a lack of mixers for cocktails (no orange juice at a $150/ticket event???)?The ""lavish pasta dinner buffet"", as described by the event flyer, was abysmal. The food immediately gave our group stomachaches, and was dry, overcooked, and quite frankly, inedible. Why was more attention not paid towards the food? Why were there not more food stations available? Is cold rigatoni heated by a lamp truly considered ""lavish pasta"" by your organization?The bathrooms were a nightmare. The lines wrapped around the outside of the bathroom, various stalls ran out of toilet paper, there were no attendants, and I witnessed two separate physical fights break out due to the lack of staff around and in the restroom. Why was there no attendant in the bathroom to ensure that women had enough utilities to feel fresh and happy throughout the night? Why was the safety of the patrons not put first and foremost??The final occurrence that made me regret my decision to spend New Year's Eve at the Hard Rock is the fact that the promotional team CLEARLY OVERSOLD tickets for this event and the DJ quite literally forced patrons in the main dance room at 11:00 to leave the room or else the party would be shut down. The amount of people in the room exceeded the fire code, and somehow this was made to be OUR fault, and the music was continuously interrupted so the manager could THREATEN us to go downstairs or the party would be shut down. It was completely absurd. The language and tone he used was absolutely unacceptable for party goers who paid a whopping $150 to be present at this understaffed, poorly thought-out event. Why were the rooms not more appropriately monitored so there would not be a problem with the fire code? Why was this addressed so harshly and despicably by the event coordinator??At 12:09, a mere NINE MINUTES after celebrating a new year beginning, the music was shut off, bars were closed, and patrons were forced out of the upstairs rooms and corralled downstairs. We then discovered that once we went downstairs to the other party (we were promised that the event continued until 2:00 am), we would not be permitted to return upstairs to retrieve our coats. This caused complete pandemonium. Individuals began chanting angrily, protesting against these ridiculous restrictions, and staff members were completely overwhelmed. Why not plan for a better system in place for patrons to get their coats, many of which are expensive and personal? Why force patrons to leave the most exciting of the rooms less than ten minutes after midnight, after the promotional flyer promised a ""4.5 hour premium package""?????Patrons were furious, myself included. I left angry, confused, and wholeheartedly regretting my decision to buy a ridiculously overpriced $150 ticket to the most over hyped and disappointing New Year's party event I had ever attended. We ended up using points to go stay at the Marriott down the road. BEWARE!!!!"
"We had 3 rooms at the Hard Rock; 2 platinum doubles and 1standard king. Though the platinum doubles are advertised having 500 square feet which is true the configuration of the room has about half that in usable space. This is due to the fact that there is hallway behind the living area, and the bathroom is like another hallway. The king was back in the corner of the hotel. The cool factor is a plus and is evident throughout the building. Should I return I would book a room in the Tower and go for a room with a view in lieu of a bigger room. The staff was cordial and made good on our TravelZoo voucher for drinks after we called TravelZoo to complain."
"Stayed at the Hard Rock Hotel Chicago during my recent visit (Nov. 13-15) and enjoyed it very much. My flight out of California was delayed several times which delayed my check in for the day, but it was still a breeze to check in when I finally got there. Room was large & the bed was comfortable, pillows were super fluffy and amazing as well (especially after a long day of traveling). Bathroom was decently sized as well! TV has good channels and the room came with complimentary wifi (which I believe is only available complimentary if you book directly through their website, but I could be wrong)Housekeeping did a good job making sure the room was clean & restocked the following day. LOCATION LOCATION LOCATION!!! Couldn't have asked for a better location, right by Millennium Park & right down the street from Magnificent Mile where you can go shop your heart out (which I did). I should have stopped by Millennium Park as it was the same weekend that the outdoor ice skating rink opened up but because I've been there before, it wasn't first on my to-do list, I quickly regretted that the moment I found out that it was the first weekend the ice rink was open! Oh well, I will be making a stop there the next time I'm in Chicago (next month). Anyway, sidetracked for a second, there are also of plenty of good eats within the area, and if it's too cold & you'd prefer to order some delivery food, some places within the area can deliver to your room & the hotel allows this, which is awesome. They do also provide room service, but didn't take advantage of it.My last evening there, I did stop and have dinner at Chuck's: A Kerry Simon Kitchen, which was AMAZING. I'm almost glad it wasn't a Hard Rock Cafe! The food was delicious and the service (Kerianne took care of us, I did also write a review for this restaurant and mentioned her as well, so go and read my review on the food & service!) was even better. Couldn't have asked for a better last evening at my stay here. I know staying on Michigan Ave. is a little expensive, however, I did get this room on a KILLER DEAL!! So that's definitely a PLUS. Would stay here if the chance arises & the price point is right!Enjoy."
"This hotel is centrally located in Chicago - the loop and the magnificent mile are all within walking distance of the hotel is also extremely close to quite a few parks and opposite the hotel is in very handy bus station that will take you to most parts of ChicagoThe staff are extremely friendly and the hotel is very clean, The rooms are of average size for a hotel but if you ask to stay in the tower upon checking in and make a donation you get to stay on the higher floors.The higher floors mean you get a bit more wind noise, the plus side is though that you get spectacular views of Chicago which ever side of the hotel your room happens to be on.The restaurant in the hotel is also really good for breakfast and evening meal as the proportions are quite normal for British people because usually I find USA portions a little bit large.The concierge in this hotel is amazing they don't mind taking a couple of minutes to explain things to do in the best way to get there.Nothing bad against the hotel but if you do go in January February expected to be extremely cold."
"I had a great weekend getaway, and overall had no complaints. The hotel and hotel rooms were clean. It has a modern minimalistic design, however it is an older hotel and the wear is visible. All hotel staff were welcoming, friendly and eager to help. Checking was really fast, I asked for a quiet room and they were able to accommodate me. Although I booked the room through Hotwire secret rate, I got a room on the 23rd floor with a view. The rooms are average size, there are 4 star hotels in the area with smaller rooms. It has the best location, right in the center of downtown with plenty of good restaurants and bars. It is also 5 min away from magnificent mile and if you want to do any shopping.I Wouldn't recommend it for a business trip.

"I stayed here 3 nights. I thought the corner room King was nice. The two queens I saw looked like any other room in a average hotel. The lobby was sparse and small. I thought the employees were helpful and friendly. . Breakfast restaurant was understaffed and very slow. I ate there once and the next two mornings went across the street to the Bagel shop. The internet was slow and didn't seem to work that great on the 13th floor. This is in the Carbide building which is very beautiful from the outside but not much on the inside. It is short walking distance to several great restaurants and shops (Magnificent Mile). The beds were comfortable but the temperature in the room was difficult to get right. I did not like the TV it was very slow and constantly had images referring.


Room Tip: Try a higher floor for a better view. Probably above the 22nd floor would have been better.

"My wife and I drove to Chicago recently for a shopping trip on Michigan Avenue and decided to stay at the Hard Rock Hotel. It was awesome! Great location, reasonable rates and outstanding service (the concierge directed us to two different restaurants which were excellent choices). We will return!


Room Tip: If possible, get a room high up and facing Michigan Avenue. Those rooms have the best views!

"Spent two nights recently to watch the US/NZ rugby match at Soldier Field. The hotel is very conveniently located to many cultural and nightlife spots in the city. It was a very short walk (4 blocks maybe) from the blue line train to the hotel which saved a considerable amount on transportation. The concierge gave excellent advice on restaurants and bars as well as nearby touristy attractions. The rooms were clean, housekeeping was attentive. We were missing a television remote and maintenance replaced it within minutes. All downtown hotels are pricey, but I would choose this again if I wanted to be downtown.

"I was staying at the hotel to babysit the infant of one of the attendants standing up for a wedding hosted at the hotel. Desk staff, check in and location were great, loved the room but I was pretty much a captive in it with a young infant. I called room service 3 times over the course of about 90 minutes trying to order something for me and the baby. Each time the call was answered by Guest Services who said my call to In-Room Dining would be returned shortly. My calls were never returned. Clearly the hotel was under-staffed and I wish they'd just stepped up to the plate and said ""it's not gonna happen"" and told me (from out of town) where to call for pizza or something."
"I've never felt like a hotel was out to take my money more than this hotel. From the miscommunication and inconsistent pricing of the group rate vs the extra nights we stayed, to the motion-sensor mini-bar (make sure you check your bill if you store your own stuff in the small mini-fridge ... you move a Miller Lite, and you're auto-charged even if you didn't remove it from the fridge!) to the emails about getting upgrades, the Hard Rock Hotel seemed to want my money more than to make my stay really rock. The communication was awful. Mostly, the bride was so disappointed with the lack of communication & the royal screw ups! The service in Chuck's, the restaurant at the lobby, was awful -- so slow, so miserable. The bathrooms are dark and make it hard to prep for a wedding -- unless you want to look like Courtney Love's bad years. Hard Rock needs to clean up its act in order to be a really great place -- like it has the potential to be. There are good parts about the hotel -- it's in a beautiful and historic building. Each floor is dedicated to a rock star. You can rent a Fender and take lessons from a video played on an in-room TV channel. The pillows and mattresses are super comfy. But if you book a room, prepare to be asked a week before your trip if you want to upgrade to an even better room for $20 more a night (appx.). Could be worth it, but I was so sick of their inconsistencies when I booked, that the last thing I wanted to do was to give them more of my cash."
"My wife and I just spent 3 nights here. It was partially business / partially a tacked-on vacation day. The hotel itself is in a very nice, historic art deco building...The Carbon and Carbide Building. It's at a good location on Michigan and Wacker, right near the river. It's an incredibly easy walk to the Magnificent Mile, very close to Millenium Park (You can be at Cloud Gate in less than 10 minutes), close to the ""theater district"", etc. When you walk into the lobby, you are greated by fairly loud rock music throughout. I like rock, but I have to admit, when I got off the elevator at 7am and stepped into loud Pat Benetar, it was a bit abrupt. We stayed in a Tower room...I highly recommend the slight upgrade. The views are spectacular. The room itself was of modest size. We had two queen beds. The bathroom is a shower only, but it was a large shower, at least. The beds were comfortable. I also appreciated that the window had both a blackout curtain and translucent blinds that pulled down...so if you didn't want to be plunged into complete darkness just to get privacy, you could do it. We never used the blackouts, but enjoyed the city lights coming through the blinds...and in the morning, gentle sunlight.We got good service at the concierge desk and the front desk (and bell desk) were friendly and helpful. Just the right balance of friendly without being overbearing. The staff is fairly young, but they were well trained and did a good job.My only complaint was with housekeeping. The first day there, I had some conference calls, so couldn't let housekeeping come up until early afternoon. When I returned to the room in the evening, the beds were made and the towels on the floor picked up. But the towels were not replaced, nor was the nearly used up soap. The next day, we got a few new towels, but never got any new shampoo, soap, etc. One day, they forgot a new floormat. They didn't give us new plastic bags for the ice bucket. Very little straightening of the room occured. I'm not a very needy traveler, and I never complained...but I wasn't entirely satisfied.Other than this, we did enjoy ourselves, and on balance, I'd stay here again. It's expensive, but it was still less than many of the nearby hotels, and I thought the historic nature of the building was also an added bonus...as my wife and I are art and architecture afficionados.


Room Tip: We got ""free wifi"" because we booked online. Otherwise, it's like $13.50 per day.

"Your money can be better spent at another Chicago Inner Loop hotel. I've been to Chicago Inner Loop for business several times and have stayed at several other hotels. This trip, all other hotels were booked and Hard Rock was the only available hotel. So the poor service started by the kid at front desk at check-in. He was very inexperienced and after traveling from across country, all you want to do is get your key, have some questions answered and get to your room. Not only was it difficult to hear him due to the loud music blasting at the front office from the bar (which is to be expected since, after all, this is the Hard Rock), but he insisted on practically whispering. There are no bellboys to help with luggage. And the room, although large and roomy, had a bathroom where the tiles were practically coming off the floor, the makeup mirror was falling off the wall, and the whole vanity was loose and moveable along with the plumbing. The building is very old, and the place is just unimpressive. But what's funny is that three AM's in a row I tried going to the hotel restaurant at 7 AM before heading out and each time waited to be sat. Although there were two people each AM eating, there was no sign of a host or a waiter. Each AM I gave it a 2 to 3 minute chance waiting there but each time I eventually left. When I ordered room service one night due to a late night working, the food came up in a timely fashion, but the meal plate was not covered. So, who knows who breathed on it, sneezed on it, or what may have gotten onto it on its way up the elevator. Pretty ghetto as far as I'm concerned. And as for price? Very similar to the other places I've stayed around town. The crowd that stays at this hotel is pretty rude, too. Definitely not geared to a business clientele as each night there were people partying and yelling thru the halls of my floor. And as for the gym downstairs, don't believe the smoke and mirrors of their website picture. The gym is very small and not impressive, either. You're better off getting a pass to LA Fitness a block away or LifeFitness that is 2 blocks away (that also has a basketball court). And as for wifi in the room? Don't bother paying for your iPhone. The wifi is not compatible to iPhones and although I paid a fortune to have my laptop and iPhone connected, I had to keep turning off the wifi on my iPhone because it was just not working. In any event, your money is better spent elsewhere. Hope this helps..."
"I wanted to surprise a friend for his birthday and booked a suite at the Hard Rock Hotel Chicago. It was the first time either of us stated at the hotel.LOCATION: The hotel is ideally situated on Michigan Avenue between all the big shopping, The Loop, and many ""L"" stations and bus stops. It's super easy to get around from the Hard Rock.CHECK-IN: I have been traveling for more than 45 years and I have NEVER had a check-in so quick as the one at the Hard Rock. Literally, less than two minutes at the desk and we were on our way to the room. When we arrived at approximately 3:45 pm, there was no line at the desk. Thirty minutes later as we were on our way out to enjoy the city, I noticed a line had begun to form, though. It did appear that everyone was being processed quickly. THE ROOM: I elected to upgrade us to a Tower Suite. Booking through the Hard Rock Chicago's website can give you the opportunity to take advantage of discounts and upgrades that booking on third-party websites does not. When we got to the room, I was a little disappointed. The room seemed almost devoid of decor and the furnishings were rather worn. The carpets had seen better days and should be replaced. There was a light grey sectional sofa in the room that looked like it was ordered from an office furniture and it had a number of unfortunate stains on it. The room had a pool table, which is sort of cool; but, it, too, had seen better days. The bathroom was huge and had really nice fixtures including a shower the size of which could host a catered party. However, the linens were very low quality. My friend said the bed was very comfortable (since there was only a king bed in the room and seeing as it was his birthday, he got the bed and I slept on the couch). THE VIEW: Our room was on the 15th floor and faced south with a fantastic view from the living room and the bathroom (there was a gigantic picture window over the soaker bathtub). Had I not been so tired from a day of travel and walking through Chicago, I would have probably stayed up into the wee hours just watching out the windows.VALUE: The room for one night was a little more than $300 -- easily more than I've ever paid for a room for a personal trip. Even being a suite, I'm not sure I felt like we got as much bang for the buck as I would have thought. I felt like we were in a big, blank room. The suites come with free Wi-Fi in the room, which was a bonus.ODDITY: The odd thing I found disappointing was a lack of music at the Hard Rock Hotel. The room had one standard iPod dock in the bedroom and no other music at all in the room. I figured we'd have some sort of in-room music channels, etc. The decor was bland and definitely didn't give you a ""living like a rock star"" feel. SUMMARY: Aside from stained, worn furnishings and cheap linens, there was nothing really wrong with the Hard Rock Hotel Chicago. But there wasn't anything overwhelmingly right with it, either. If I got an outstanding deal on a room, I'd probably consider staying there again, but it will not be my first choice of properties in Chicago."
"I go back to Fats Domino and Elvis. Music brings the generations together just as baseball has been credited with doing here in America. No better place than the Hard Rock where floors are dedicated to rock stars and music is always playing in the lobby. The club was rocking as well. The staff was terrific. We were given an upgrade, the concierge helped with local travel and bags were stowed after a late check out. We always had the feeling that the staff would do whatever they could forus. The room was on a high floor which was delightful and most importantly, clean, roomy and well stocked with morning coffee, towels and extra drinks and snacks (at a cost).I try to keep a lid on hotel prices but with this hotel, in the center of everything, there is great value; the hotel is close to the station coming from the airport/other city lines. The Art Institute is down the street as was the Cloud Gate sculpture that you must see. Also,the well knownboat tours leave from the closest point to the river from the hotel.It is all there for you. Get to know your children, grandchildren, mothers and fathers, aunts and uncles, even your brothers and sisters by starting with ""so who is your favorite artist""? That artist may just have floor 33 dedicated to him - Bono!

"This was a perfect hotel for our son's wedding group. Great location. Everyone from out of town could walk to the city's attractions - parks museums, boat trips. They raved about how easy it all was. The staff was outstanding - planning, execution of the events, rooms. Couldn't have asked for anything better. Didn't know much about them to begin with other than they had occupied the old Union Carbide building. Now, can't say enough about them. A well rounded experience.

Location couldn't be better. Great shopping and restaurants are all walkable! Saved a lot of $ with no cabs. It was surprisingly quiet and the service was perfect. Room was clean and comfortable. A few special requests for more towels and more in-room coffees were fulfilled quickly. Nightlife in the bar was fun with post wedding party dancing. Close enough to the finish of the marathon as well. Nice surprise!

"First I will start out by saying the service at front desk is amazing. My issue is more with the rooms themselves. Bought a groupon and also belong to hard rock VIP club so I expected a bit of an upgraded room (paid for 2queens with city views). Room was very small, sink was broken, picture missing off wall with hooks still attached and bathroom door wouldn't latch or close. Mentioned to staff who happily moved us to a huge corner room (same style with 2 queens) and view is great however- woke this morning at 7:30am to jackhammers and pounding on building directly next door. I realize the construction is not the HR problem but even with windows closed and tv on, it's so loud and disturbing. Better insulation or warning would've been nice. Even on Sat am, pounding continues. Have stayed in Chicago many times at other hotels...Palmer Hilton is where I'll be going back. Really disappointed with the hard rock...sad because I expected to be blown away. Usually their properties are awesome but even with the amazing service, not sure unless they do major remodel, I'd come back.

"Stayed the night in one of the suites with the groom and a few of the groomsmen. My friend was having his wedding there. Room was nice, I guess I has higher expectations for a suite, floor seemed a little worn. It did include a pool table which was cool. Asked the front desk to bring us a fridge which they did, but the fridge did not work. Didn't bother asking for another fridge. Staff was friendly and prompt with our requests. It was a hectic weekend and the staff helped keep things running as smooth as possible. We had a nice view from the room and a great time. The wedding venue at the Hard Rock was great! Great location in downtown Chicago.

"Had my flight(s) canceled on Friday, could only get out at 2am. Decided to stay in town and thought the Hard Rock might be a good place to stay.Checked in, room keys didn't work.

Got into the room and it was a big disappointment.Bathroom countertop had ""stuff"" on it, coffee cups were dusty, spilled/dried coffee on the remaining k-cups, room just felt dirty.Called front desk and they gave is another room, which was much cleaner.Service was OK. One thing I didn't know until I went to the bar is there is no live music at the hotel.... Only a DJ in the bar at night. That was a real surprise, would have thought the hard rock hotel would have a band at night. Location is OK but most live music appears to he across the river. If you're into shopping the magic mile the location is OK.Would I go back? There are many hotels in the price range downtown, would look for another place next time...."
This hotel has a great location and isn't too badly priced for the area. We were here for two nights/three days. We did valet parking with the room and didn't need our vehicle until we went home due to the fact that everything was within walking distance. The hotel hallways are a little dark and seem like they need more light but it might just be an after effect of the building the hotel is in. We would stay here again when visiting Chicago.
"I stayed here on the Tina Turner floor, as we called it, during a business conference. The hotel is in a good location for wandering the river front or checking out the Magnificent Mile; an easy walk (in nice weather) to the parks and a quick cab or bus ride away from other attractions like Navy Pier, Shedd Aquarium, Wrigley Field, etc.The room was furnished and decorated in a pleasing, modern style with comfortable furnishings. We had no problems with the staff, room service, or any other amenities. A bit pricey, as I recall, but I would stay there again!"
"We had a pair of rooms over the weekend, and had an enjoyable time. The hotel was nice, the service was really good, and the price was quite reasonable given the prices in the area. Parts of our room were a bit dated, the remote control for the TV seemed to work only with some convincing, and the air conditioning was far from forceful, but there was nothing that was a huge deal. Room sizes were a bit on the smallish size, but definitely not EU sized. The service was very friendly, and the vibe in the hotel was energetic and lively. I didn't get a chance to try out room service, but the menu looked decent. I would definitely return, although I would check out my other options.

"Got a great rate from third party website for the time that we were traveling. We got to the hotel earlier that check in time but they were able to check us in, which was great because we could freshen up before going out to town. The housekeeping crew was great, they lined up our personal bath products in a neat row and tidied up the beds, but what made it really special was the fact that they put my son's stuffed animal in the middle of the bed along with my son's personal blankie...that totally made him so happy :)I was curious about the late check out policy, so I called the front desk, and was surprised to be greeted with Mrs. .... (last name) instead of the generic greeting. The front desk gave me complimentary check out, which we didn't end up needing but it was appreciated.After check out, they held our luggage too so we could go around town until it was time to go. Very satisfied and definitely recommended."
"A really nice hotel. Despite the ""Hard Rock"" name, there is not rock music blaring anywhere in the hotel. Exterior and elevator lobby are nicely understated art deco. Rooms are spacious and modern. Nice touches everywhere. Two examples: Individual pull-down reading lights on both sides of the bed so that the non-reading partner is not disturbed. A separate vanity area with a back-lit makeup mirror. Staff are friendly, helpful, and knowledgeable. The location on Michigan Ave., just two blocks south of the Chicago River (the beginning of the Magnificent Mile) is a great. It's also two blocks from Millennium Park and one of the best breakfasts (Wildberry on E. Randolph). Not inexpensive, but a really fair price given it's location and amenities. Note that actual entrance is on E. Wacker Pl. (around the corner) even though it lists a Michigan Ave. address."
"This was a ""splurge"" stay for us, trip from Ontario to Louisiana stopping in Chicago and Nashville along the way. We had looked online for hotels before we left and had selected a few pet friendly hotels as options. Based on past experiences , the ""pet friendly"" rooms are the dingy, back corner, rarely serviced rooms in need of repair. This was the opposite, downright amazing! We felt like guests of honor, and so did our dog. Everyone was very friendly throughout the hotel. The concierge let us know where to walk the dog (those stairs down to the riverside 5-6 times /day are a workout!!) very pleased to have the park & stay package as an option"
"A very nice stay. All the staff were especially friendly. They were very knowledgable of where to go, how to get there and what to expect. All was wonderful BUT watch your bill we were billed for 5 drinks from the refrig. bar in the room that we did not have. In fact we discussed the bar use with staff who came to our room at our request as we had touched a bottle while putting a sandwich in and then read the fine print that said, motion sensitive you may be billed. We were assured we would NOT be billed, but we were. Others in our party were also including one whose room refrigerator was empty and remained empty throughout there 4 day stay."
"If you are a music fan like I am, all genres, you will appreciate this hotel the minute you walk in the door, walk the red carpet and here the music playing. The decor is modern and luxurious, but with a fun, trendy, rock edge!Each floor is themed after a music legend and you'll know who as soon as you exit the elevator, to your right you'll see a huge mural representing the icon and to your right some memorabilia from the artist...I was on the Rolling Stones floor!Once you enter your room you'll see a luxurious bed and mirror with a quote from your music legend etched in the mirror along with other music-inspired artwork. I found the room clean, spacious and with adequate closet space, I had a fun city view. It's very convenient to everything right off of Michigan avenue, there's even a Walgreens next store.I loved the Angels & Kings bar on Friday night, friendly hostesses and great mixture of music from all genres, I had in-room breakfast that was timely and delicious and before my flight the 2nd day, I had drinks and appetizers at Chuck's both were excellent.

"We've stayed in a handful of different hotels around Michigan Ave over the years. We used to love the old Wyndham before it got bought out and prices went up/service down. Decided to book a Labor Day weekend in Chicago and the Hard Rock Hotel was one of, if not the best, priced hotels in the area, so we thought we'd give it a shot.Really liked the place. Service is excellent, the rooms are amazing for a hotel of this price/location/age. We expected tiny rooms, but they are a very nice size, and well appointed and maintained. We got to the hotel at 9:30AM after taking an early train, and our room was ready for us, so we were able to unpack immediately. I don't think I've ever arrived at a hotel that early and had the room ready.Overall, we really liked HRH, and it's now at the top of our list to stay in the area.


Room Tip: Save money, and sleep quiet by taking the rooms facing the ""back"" of the hotel. Not much...

"The Hard Rock Hotel is the historic art-deco Carbide and Carbon Building-- a dark beauty of 1920s Chicago architecture. Stay for that reason alone. As you would expect, rooms are appointed with portraits of rock gods loosely based on a theme (mine had both Robert Plant and Joan Jett?) and the overall feel is modern and minimalist. Staff is helpful and friendly. A special thanks to Sheila the concierge for steering me to Lou Malnati's for dinner. Morning showers were hot. I was worried about cold water as some have mentioned in their reviews, but it was not a problem during my stay. Location is superb (close to trains and major attractions) and the atmosphere is swank-- a hipster heaven in the heart of the Loop.


Room Tip: Ask for a wi-fi voucher at the desk if you didn't book through Hard Rock. Higher floors are quie...

"The HRH in Chicago is a great place to stay, if you're there for a nightlife visit. The bar downstairs seems to always have live music and is always busy so what ever time you get in from your Chicago adventures, you can have a last drink before bed.The rooms are big and spacious and up to date. In fact the whole hotel is in great condition with a good style as well as keeping a hint of its history. The memorabilia on the walls is like most Hard Rock Cafe's but less of it and the cool merch shop is there to remind you that its a brand first and foremost.The staff are all friendly and cool, ties undone, jeans and shirt for the doormen. Its deliberate, to try and give that sort of casual vibe, as though a suit is too stuffy but you're cool enough to not get worked up over it. Its as much a uniform as anything but hey, its a Hard Rock hotel not the Four Seasons.Its in a great location to get around and see stuff and the building itself is impressive. Plenty of places to eat and drink near by, all within walking distance and so I'd highly recommend it as a place to 'crash' which is kind of the attitude they are sort of trying to make you think they're going for.Downsides, no free wifi but hey what else is new in the US.Didn't get to try the restaurant either so can't comment


Room Tip: Get a corner room, you get a bit more space and extra views.

"Room was comfortable, clean, and bright. The furniture was nice and modern, and the bed was very comfortable. The washroom was clean as well, albeit the sink/counter was a little small. The only negative thing was that the mini-fridge was charged by the weight removed from it. If you so much as moved a drink around, you could be charged automatically. Too bad, because the hotel is literally right next to a Walgreens where you can pick up snacks and whatnot. Location is the best feature of this hotel. It's right on Michigan Ave- Millennium park is across the street, Magnificent Mile is across the bridge, and there are several train stations close by. And as previously mentioned, there is a Walgreens right next to the hotel. No free wifi unless you book directly through the hotel itself. Not a huge complaint though, because the hotel is close to several Starbucks. However, you are free to use the business centre that provides internet access and printing."
"I was in Chicago for a conference which put me up at the Hard Rock and I was pleasantly surprised. My room had a view of the lake, was quiet large and very quite. The hotel services were all great - the business center had free printing, and the dry cleaning service was very good. The only big disappointment was that the wifi was unexpectedly expensive. The location is convenient if you are going to be downtown, or have pre-arranged transportation. A number of good restaurants within a block, and the Chicago river is close by."
"We spent two nights here in April and I must say, the room was rough. Stains on the walls, curtains, burns in the couch, the bathroom shower needed a good scrubbing, and the window howled all night long. There are nicer places to stay for the same price. I emailed the hotel upon returning from my stay and I got a general response about helping them understand my experience. The ""night club"" was awful and the drinks are very acidic."
"The hotel is ok, rooms are nothing to brag about but bed was comfortable which is very important. Unfortunately our room faced a construction so when we were in the room the background noise wasn't nice. There is a lobby bar so if you like that scene they had live music every evening. Location is great, right near the Millenial Park... We actually only took a cab once later at night, other than that we did the whole tourist trip walking. The other bummer is that wifi is only free in common areas, in room there is a daily fee...Watch out when you check out since we had a mini bar charge that did not apply (it has sensors so you can easily get charged for something by mistake)."
"The rooms could stand a little updating. I wish I had of known that booking a suite would mean being near the elevator and hearing the elevator shaft bang all night. When we called the front desk to complain, we were basically told it would eventually get quiet. Yea, it did about 5am but only for a few. I'm not sure I'd stay here again despite the great deal we got on Expedia. I didn't find the hotel staff very friendly or over accommodating either. I asked the concierge about a couple restaurants his answer was to hand me a map and say find what you need on there."
"Our experience at this hotel was great. The gym had every equipment you could think of. The staff was very friendly. The room was very spacious and modern. If this is your first time going to Chicago I would definitely recommend this hotel. The location is in the heart of downtown. Right across the street from great restaurants and the millennium park where the bean and the art museum are located. Close to the train rails. Chicago rails are so easy to navigate through, definitely recommend it. We had an awesome view of the skyline and the river."
"We stayed in the Hard Rock Hotel at the end of April. Its in a fantastic location, in the heart of Chicago and within walking distance to all the major attractions. The hotel is in a fabulous art deco building and our room was spacious. It was a bit noisy, being beside the elevator and there was also a lot of early morning construction going on nearby. There was no breakfast included but the major negative is that there was no free wifi. It was free in the lobby but there was a charge in the room. These days I think nearly every hotel offers free wifi so this seemed to be an unnecessary money-grabbing ploy. Overall I would recommend the hotel due to its great location and we had also gotten a great deal online.


Room Tip: Ask for a room on a higher floor and away from the elevator

"Recently visited Chicago for a week end get away and stayed at this hotel. Staff was very nice. Concierge was very helpful and knowledgable. Hotel is in a great central location and is located within easy walking distance of Lake Michigan and the Miraculous Mile shopping section. Hotel is starting to show its age but all in all a really nice experience. Chicago is a gorgeous city and we will be back soon!


Room Tip: Construction of a new skyscraper on the North side of the building. Can get a little noisy.

"I read some of the reviews before we booked, and was wondering what kind of experience we would have. I was totally impressed with our room, and service. We booked through Hotels.com, and got a beautiful corner room on the 23rd floor, right over the river, and at an extremely great price. It was clean, bright, and spectacular view of the river, Trump Tower, Allerton Hotel ( lighted at night ), Marina Towers, and more. Room was made up at our convenience. We did not have much contact with the front desk, but they were cordial when we checked in and out. One issue was the toilet which did not always flush unless you held down the handle, but the bed and pillows were very comfortable. The bar service downstairs was very good. We were able to walk to many places, the location is fantastic, near Eately, the Art Institute, Millenium Park, and more.


Room Tip: City view, corner rooms are spacious, bright, with spectacular views

"The hotel was in a great location. The hotel staff was very helpful and friendly.I was running late in the morning, so I ordered room service breakfast 2 days in a row, and I must say that it was terrible! If possible try to go outside to grab a bite to eat. There is a really good breakfast place about 3 blocks away.The hotel has a small restaurant/bar where food is served.There is also a really neat bar/ lounge in the ground floor of the same building. I did not like that the entire hotel lacked light. It was very dark in the hallways, which was kind of scary.Overall the hotel had good customer service, good location, was clean and comfortable.However, it is not one of my favorites :(


Room Tip: Choose a higher room for a view. All I could see in the 5th floor was the side of another building.

"Stayed here as part of a mini tour of the eastern side of the states & loved every minute. Whilst Chicago was caked in snow we were still able to get out & about with the help of the wonderful Hard Rock staff & they made us feel like rock stars for the whole of our stay. The rooms are big & the beds massive, clean & just proper the way a high end hotel should be. Love it and would stay again. Party on dudes!!!"
"Recently spent two nights at this hotel at a reasonable rate for the location. Rooms were contemporary, not large, but comfortable. Only negative - no view. Right on Michigan Ave, it's close to Millenium Park and North Michigan Ave. for shopping. Chucks restaurant had a variety of choices for all meals, and won the Iron Chef Burger contest on the Food Network. Two bars, one late-night offer choice for imbibing. Younger clientele, lots of tattoos, but friendly staff.


Room Tip: No views unless facing Michigan Ave.

"The hotel is a great location for getting all over the main area of Chicago, lots of places of interest near by within walking distance. The hotel itself is nice enough but very dark and a bit dismal and missing something. We stayed in August 2013, a room on the 23rd floor. The room wasn't any better than most travel lodges etc, an additional print in most areas of a rock star, we had Sting and John Lennon. It wasn't over the top expensive but it was not to cheap either. Don't know what we expected from The Hard Rock Chicago, but it didn't feel special to us for our 4 night stay their last year. However I am not knocking it either as it just lacked 'that something special!'


Room Tip: Get a room as high up in the building as possible, great views!

"2 simple things - we asked for extra towels when we checked in and had to call again that night to make the same request.Our shower was cold - we called the front desk and they said something about checking a boiler on our floor. We knew of people staying on 2 other floors who also had cold showers -Hook on the back of the bathroom door was missing.


Room Tip: Be sure shower is hot or call right away - if unfix-able I would ask for an adjustment to rate

Problem with door was stated from initial visit check-in and was never fixed. Water in room was cold. Called and complained but was never fixed. Upon exit staff was very unfriendly and we called for a yellow taxi an hour before. When they called us to come down from our room we came outside to the doorman escorting someone into our cab and the bellman said they were there first even though we called the company and the cab driver confirmed it was our reservation. We watched the bellman take a tip from the person he escorted into the cab and when he was asked for his name he ignored us and went inside. My wife and I travel and stay in hotels all across the nation as we are consultants. We have stayed in many Hard Rock Hotels and never had these problems. The only reason we came to this location is because we had VIP reservations for the Plaboy NYE Party. The cleanliness of the room was good and the staff for room service was good as well though.We will never stay at a Hard Rock Hotel again.
"I hate writing bad reviews, but this stay warrants one. Arrived to check in, unpleasant front desk..okay, not the end of the world. Until we got to our room. The very corner room with awful, let me rephrase, NO view. Ridiculous. Dirty floor. Dirty hallways smelling of urine mixed with some cover-up scent. Bathroom faucet was about to fall off, I was so nervous to use it. Bathroom was outdated and not clean, and, upon walking in, the stench of sewage permeated our noses...as if someone had just used it before we checked in. Disgusting. Shower was COLD and the mini bar was WARM. Sheet was ripped. House keeping was supposed to be back at 9:30 and our room wasn't even touched when we returned at 1...got extra towels from the cart instead. Oh, and extra towels? One had nasty remnants of a big blood stain...Seriously? Gross. Also...got charged 6 internet connection fees totaling close to $90. So much more to be said, but I ranted enough. Never have I given a bad review...so you know it was awful. Even if we were given a credit to stay here again, no way in heck we would. Don't stay here!!!!


Room Tip: Just DON'T stay here.

"From the minute we pulled up valet was horrible ! We unloaded own bags and was pointed to luggage cart! Greeted with a frown and employee who would rather argue than listen. Hallways were filthy ! Floors dirty, entire hotel reeked of cigarette smoke although it claims ""No Smoking"" , bathroom faucet was about to fall off vanity. View WAS HORRIBLE ! Overlooking roof top of air conditioning units and smoke stacks ! Sadly we paid ""Extra"" for so called ""City View"". Would not refer will not be back ! Was never able to speak to management."
"Stayed here with my 7 year old son. We chose this place because of price break for after holidays and my sin was hyped about anything Hard Rock! Friendly staff upon check in. House keeping not overly attentive to detail. Same dirty glass in hallway since we've checked in and this is night 2!! Room is ok. Do not pick this hotel if you like supportive furniture!! It is like a mix of old hotel feel meets modern furniture. Cool but not comfy or ergonomically correct! Location decent -In between shopping on Michigan, shopping on State Street, Millennium Park and museums. We will not stay again, but it still rates average compared to other places I've stayed."
"I don't know where to start because there was so much wrong with our stay here! The in-room WiFi was horribly slow and cost $18.50. We had to call their InnFlux 800 # in order to get connected and they had a hard time getting it to work. The hotel billed us for each time the customer support rep tried to connect us, so our internet bill was $148. My husband thought he had it corrected with the front desk through a revised invoice, but we were billed the $148 anyway. Then they didn't invoice us for the outrageously-priced $60 valet parking service. So we had to tell them about that.The bed was horribly hard and the temperature control in the room didn't work so we were hot all evening and they could not get it fixed. Our drapes were all frayed and torn on the edges.The TV remote didn't work right.The door to the room would not shut properly unless you really leaned on it. Loud and obnoxious music was playing almost constantly in the lobby.The elevators were horribly slow.The maids started knocking on doors at 8 am Sunday morning trying to find rooms that they could start cleaning.I'm certain that I've forgotten something!!"
"Stayed in a platinum king room on the fourteenth floor (Elton John floor). Bought the stay on Groupon and it was so worth it! This was a surprise birthday trip for my girlfriend and I went ahead a threw in a proposal just to make it really special! I had been in contact with the concierge, Josh, before I traveled to set up some things for the night and he came through. The hotel is immaculate, full of history, and in a perfect location on Michigan Avenue, right between the shopping and Millennium Park. I took advantage of the hotel's Picks program which allows you to jam on a Fender guitar in your room for free. Very nice! Make sure you have dinner at Chuck's in the hotel. It's been reimagined by Iron Chef Kerry Simon and the pork chop and mashed potatoes were the best I'd ever had. My whole experience was perfect!"
"I was a little nervous when I read some of the reviews. They talked about the noise and dirty bathrooms etc. However, I must say that my experience was anything but negative. We stayed on the 17th floor. The room was right by the employee office and the ice machine. I was a little nervous about that, even though I packed ear plugs. However, I did not want to change the room, as we had a great view of the Michigan Avenue and the Cloud Gate (""Bean""). I did not hear any noises, but I did have my earplugs in. The room itself is very spacious, TV is great. The bathroom was big and clean. Yes, there were some cosmetic issues (a missing hook on one of the curtains, one of the light bulbs didn't work), but who doesn't have those? The staff at the reception, concierge and cleaning were very friendly. Location of the hotel is unbeatable. Everything is withing walking distance, Millennium Park is about a 5 minute walk. I would definitely want to stay here again!"
"We stayed two weeks ago for Thanksgiving and we had the most comfortable stay at Hard Rock in Chicago. I am a big fan of all Hard Rock Hotels Cafes and Casinos, we couldn't be more satisfied with the service from all that work at this hotel. The people are always willing to give 200% to make your stay the best. The rooms are spacious, clean and fun with all the memorabilia. The food is wonderful if you want to stay in and have a bite at Chuck's or if you decide to go to Angel's and Kings. Angels and Kings always have a live band rockn or you may have their wonderful breakfast in the morning. We were treated with the upmost fantabulous service. To be staying right on the magnificent mile has been the best experience ever for my family, the train station is not far at all and of course walking to the shopping area or to see a play was so close to everything. We would reccommend to all and we will definetely be back. Pam from Indiana

"I stayed at the Hard Rock Chicago in October 2013. The hotel is modern and funky. Rock themes on each floor and in your room. I was on the 4th floor in a standard room. The view was of the Walgreens across the street. Nothing too exciting. Bed was comfortable and the bath products are exceptional. I was traveling for work so my company picked up the tab. If this would have been on my nickel, I would have said it was not worth it. There was no bottled water in the room and the two attached restaurants were very expensive. If I have to travel again for work, I would probably try a different hotel just to mix it up.


Room Tip: Higher floor better view

"Superbly attentive staff, cool, friendly attitude! We were upgraded before they even knew we were reward members, sent a comp bottle of wine to the room when we told the bell boy that we were on our anniversary, and also a couple of days later a bucket with beers and popcorn (Garretts... do not leave Chicago without getting some). Room could use a bit more lightning and a lot more decor, but it was huge and with great views. Overall a great experience, would definitely go back. Oh and the location is simply perfect."
"The Hard Rock Hotel's location is perfect for anyone wanting to walk the great city of Chicago! We have stayed all over the downtown area and I have to admit that we will remember this stay as one of our best. We had won a two-night stay at a fundraiser in Kalamazoo, Michigan and called into see if we could upgrade to a Tower Suite. For a reasonable fee, we were able to upgrade and the tower suites deliver a commanding view of the city. We had an east facing (like the whole east half of the tower) where we could easily see north all the way up Michigan Avenue to the Hancock Building, below us was the Chicago River, to the South, Grant Park, Millennium Plaza, Art Institute were in clear view, to our Southwest, we could see the Willis (Sears) Tower and Theater District. You can easily walk into the best shopping on Michigan Avenue as the hotel is on Michigan Avenue! The museums are a two mile walk to Field or Shedd or Adler, but Science and Industry requires a 6 mile trip - too far to walk. The staff was very helpful and asked our sons if they wanted to play Fender guitars in our room - we picked out a nice red Fender strat and they delivered a guitar, effect pedal, and headphones so we could rock in the nice living room - and that part was FREE - nice fringe benefit. This is our first stay at a Hard Rock property and we liked it! If you know anything about architecture, then you will appreciate the building too. You can see it in the skyline for the last 80 years or more - way before the Sears Tower appeared. We hope to visit again within the next year or so!


Room Tip: Tower Suites are the way to rock the house!

"I stayed here, and it was truly in the perfect location. My best friend and I were able to walk around the corner to get lunch at a local restaurant with great eats and find a popular breakfast spot steps away the next morning. We also found a local shuttle at a nearby hotel that took us to a casino in Hammond, Indiana which was a nice surprise.The concierge was super nice and accommodating. They always had recommendations and suggestions and made all of our agenda happen with ease.The hotel is also close to shops and the center of it all in Magnificent Mile whether you prefer to walk or take a taxi.We definitely recommend it!


Room Tip: Upgrade to a suite. We did and the difference was minimal!

Fantastic stay at the HRH in Chicago. Staff were all very friendly and helpful. The hotel is located at the top of Miracle mile so it's an ideal location for shopping and seeing the sights. The building itself is a fantastic building with lots of history (notice how it looks like a champagne bottle?)Having stopped in numerous Hard Rock hotels around the world this one did not disappoint and we would definitely visit again if we find ourselves in Chicago
"The Hard Rock Hotel in Chicago is in the historic Carbide and Carbon building from the 1930's. Each floor's theme ties with a band, I stayed on the Elton John floor. Great views of the city and a convenient walk to many great Chicago eating and shopping locations.Staff was great and the room was plenty big (sometimes old converted office buildings have small rooms). I will stay there again when I go back to Chicago.


Room Tip: The higher floors with room numbers ending in 04 or 05 have great views

"Hotel is very central for doing most of the tourist things in Central Chicago, being only a few hundred meters form the river and on the main avenue. We had a corner room on the 15th floor , which gave a great view. The Room was quite spacious and comfortable , but it didn't wow us, the theming in the public areas was more interesting and we ended up taking the lift to different floors and walking up/down each time we returned to see the different exhibits. The period architecture of the public space on the lower floors is also very interesting. We took breakfast there for the 3 days we stayed and Lila was a most friendly waitress , who gave us some great advice on how to do things in the city."
"Everything was satisfactory. The room was clean and the bed fairly comfortable but almost every thing was gray. So, the decor was kind of drab. The bathroom fixtures looked a little dated. The hotel is in a nice location on Michigan Ave just off the river. My only real complaint is that valllet parking was $60, which was a third of the cost of the room. I know I'm in downtown Chicago, but that just seems ridiculous."
"We recently hosted our wedding at the Hard Rock Hotel Chicago and could not have asked for anything better! This hotel is in such a unique building and a fantastic location. The inside is very cool with lots of rock and roll memorabilia and cool lighting and finishing. Then you have the fabulous Michigan Ave. right at your doorstep for fantastic photos outside! The staff there is so friendly. Everyone is willing to help you and make sure your stay is perfect. I would highly recommend this venue for anyone who is looking for a fun, unique but elegant wedding."
"Recently attended a wedding at the Hard Rock and decided to stay overnight rather than make the long drive back north to the suburbs. Could not have been more pleased with the hotel. Check-in was extremely easy, room amenities and decor were great, pre-wedding drinks and snacks at Chuck's were delicious and wedding was amazing. Great reception room, drinks and food! Highly recommend Hard Rock for an overnight stay in the city -- great location and staff!"
"Service is everything you would expect from a top-end hotel. Staff are pleasant and willing to help. Breakfast room is quite small, but adequate. All rooms and the hotel in general have the usual hard rock touches making it a great experience. The hotel also has its own hard rock gift shop offering unique chicago hotel souvenirs, but as usual with hard rock these are quite expensive. Hotel location is excellent - within ten minutes walk of the golden mile."
"I stayed at the hotel for three nights over a weekend recently. Customer service was great, rooms were very clean, the whole hotel was clean and is nicely appointed. That being said, I'll agree with other reviewers that the halls/neighbors were loud and woke me up consistently throughout the stay. There were several broken items in my room, including a couple of lamps and the curtain rod. For the location, the price was great and I am willing to overlook a few imperfections, especially since they did not relate to cleanliness. Pack a pair of earplugs though!"
"I was supposed to stay here 5 nights for business. This is clearly not a business hotel but the company I was visiting made the reservation at the Hard Rock due to its location. This hotel is desperately in need to maintenance. The hallways look old, dusty and run down. I complained that the ice maker in the hallway was making terribly loud noises but nothing was done. It was when I got into the shower and saw all the black mold and mildew that I decided this was it. I'm posting a photo because this is not to be believed. The bathroom floor had dust and hair in one corner. The bathroom door was de-laminating due to moisture...I cannot recommend this hotel. Needless to say, the company is no longer putting guests here either after I showed the photos."
"Awesome stay at this hotel right in the heart of Chicago! The hotel is located perfectly on Michicgan Avenue halfway between Millenium Park and the main shopping area so you can enjoy walks each way depending on where you want to go.The hotel is in a beautiful art deco building with some of the orginal features still remaining. Our room was of ample size, very clean and that free guitar makes it fun!Staff are cool, prices are reasonable but its the location that is the celebrity of this hotel."
Stayed here for our third and final lap of our US tour. We came from Orlando and had to deal with an old hotel. So Hard Rock was a pleasant stay. Booked 3 rooms and the staff was very helpful. My sister had a problem with their small room and they upgraded that to a bigger room at the higher floors with the best view. The room was clean and updated. My wife didn't like an old Iggy Pop hanging on the wall half naked but I didn't mind. Toilets were clean and very comfortable. NO free WIFI though. Bar downstairs offers food and drinks. But closes a bit early. Very welcoming waitress who tipped us a great bar which closes at later with open kitchen. You could even play a fender if you wish to.
"Stayed for two nights on the 22nd floor, King bed room. Check-in was fast and every staff member we dealt with the whole weekend were very courteous. Room was clean and comfortable. Can't beat the location. Ate dinner at Chuck's Manufacturing and was very happy with our food/service. Also wined & dined at the attached Angels & Kings bar/club, and again was pleased. Overall, I left satisfied, and would stay here again."
"We booked a room thru Priceline and paid what we thought was a good rate for a room within a short walk of the Art Institute. The room was still not cheap, but we were thrilled with the location. When we arrived, we were given a room on one of the higher floors. This room had a faucet that was not completely attached to the countertop or sink, and looked a little worn in other ways. The view was unremarkable at best, looking out over some air conditioning units. The worst part was a loud squeaking noise that probably came from one of the units and was clearly audible in the room. We stayed in the room for less than 5 minutes before asking for a different room. We were told there were only 5 empty rooms in the hotel. They put us in a room on one of the ""tower floors"". We noticed that the curtains were frayed with torn edges, and they looked like someone had vomited on them as there were gross spots all over them. They needed to be burned and replaced. The view was better, and the squeaking noise was absent. My partner picked up a funky little pillow with a yarn cover off of the bed, and a piece of the yarn fell out. Cheap or else just warn out? Worst of all, the room was apparently right above at least two elevator shafts. Every time one of the elevators beneath the room moved, we heard a loud thud. After trying to sleep (unsuccessfully) for about 10 minutes, we again went to the front desk and asked for a new room. They moved us to yet another floor and this time, no elevator noise and no squeaking air conditioners could be heard. The worst thing we can say about our present room is that the bath mat is frayed. For all of our troubles, the management gave us free drinks. We appreciated the drinks, but feel like the property has seen better days. We know we did not pay full price for a hotel, but we do expect to have a room suitable for sleeping regardless of where we might stay or what we might pay. The noise levels were completely unacceptable in our first two rooms. We have to believe we are not the first guests to express concerns about them and are a little peeved that we would be assigned to them in the first place. If we had paid full price and had had the experience that we have had, we would have been furious. As it is, we just won't come back to this property. We think they are not investing money in the basic infrastructure and will probably dump this property at some point in the near future.

"Was just hear for a work trip and had a great experience. The hotel has a great location at the corner of Michigan and Wacker in this absolutely gorgeous old building. It's a bit hard to tell the location because they couldn't up huge signage that would spoil the historical, old signage.The service was great with everyone being extremely friendly and efficient. The check-in process was great and my room was gorgeous. i was up on the 20th floor with a beautiful view of the city including some landmarks. Frankly my only issue was getting to the hotel. Because it's impossible to make a u-turn on Michigan, we somehow ended up on a lower level of the city that seemed kind of scary. Apparently, it's used for parking and such, and thankfully it's used by the homeless as a racket to make money by guiding out tourists who get lost.


Room Tip: Ask for a higher floor. The view is worth it.

"Everyone was top notch. Our stay was perfect. The whole staff was very professional and polite. If you want a more private floor, stay in one of the Tower floors. We stayed on the 34th floor and it was unique from the rest of the hotel. The location is perfect. We were walking distance from most everywhere we wanted to go. The building across from the hotel on Michigan Avenue had several places to grab quick breakfast and lunch in it. While unloading my car I dropped my tickets to a White Sox game in the street. A few minutes later I got a call in my room, they had been found by Kevin. He could have kept them and gone to the game himself but he did the right thing. My wife and I did a lot of research before booking a hotel in Chicago and we are so glad we chose Hard Rock Hotel.


Room Tip: NO POOL, NO SPA. Stay in the Tower if you can. Corner rooms with a terrific view!

"Not only was the room not what was described in internet: a suite studio for 4 people. It only had a king bed and a small sofa -not a sleeping sofa- when i asked to have another room they said this one was the one i had booked and there was no other. i had to ""beg"" literally to have a couple of pillows and a couple of towels to have one for each of us. We were 4.but that was nothing compared to being awaken by a very violent man knocking on our room door wanting to get in at 4.10 am. we called security and when security came the guy was gone but he came back twice more. the third time he said he would take the door down!!!as security was not there, i had to call 911 the Chicago Police Department!!!my husband, my 2 kids and i were very very scared!!!the hotel never appologised they just gave us another room but the service the rest of the time was very bad. we payed for a 5 star hotel and received a 1 star hotel service."
"I was very excited to stay at the Hard Rock for my 5 days in Chicago. I have to say I may have had too high of standards for the Hard Rock so I want to make sure I am fair in what I say. I was able to check in early which was great, but I was only on the 8th floor. While I had a corner room, I could see into the building next to me. Literally a guy working at his desk. So, I had to make sure blinds were closed etc which made the room really dark. The hallway and rooms were a little dark as well, lots of grays and I think I was expecting more, brighter colors - a little more rock and roll and a little less blues. All of the staff was wonderful, very nice. The rooms was a great size for one person or a couple, comfortable, clean - and thank god for the alarm clock that played nature sounds so that us light sleepers can have white noise. No problem getting cabs, directions, anything I needed. The highlight was the Angels and Kings bar area. Great drinks, good food, great service! The location was AMAZING. On Michigan Avenue, walk to most places. I would stay again, if I could get a room that was a bit higher level - but to be fair, that is what happens when you check in early AND you are in Chicago - they have tall buildings!


Room Tip: Get a high level room especially if you are a light sleeper. Very close to the busy road and you can...

This was my first time in chicago and was expecting the hotel to be a high standard one... well i was surprised...the rooms are definitely not what I would call high end and not worth the price paid at that time... the service was terrible I was late to attend a wedding because the laundry service could not deliver my shirts on time...had to go buy a shirt and iron it and when you call the hotel guest service they lie to you and tell you the guy is on his Waaayy but god knows when he will reach... a friendly advise to all travelers dont go there....everr
"Fabulous experience at Hard Rock Hotel with teenage boys. Staff was friendly and extremely helpful. Staff allowed us to check in early upon arrival. Our boys favorite part was using Fender guitars in room. Beds were the most comfortable of any hotel beds we have experienced. Location was great for our activities- Magnificent Mile, Navy Pier, ""L"" to White Sox game, great restaurants and near walking path along Lake Michigan. Would highly recommend this hotel!"
"We had a two day work event at the hotel. Picked for the fun atmosphere and location. Meeting room, food, catering staff were wonderful to deal with. Hotel rooms were clean and had fun Rock'n Roll themes. Only compliant we as a group had, was that the internet was not good. At times very easy to get on, other times could not get on at all. If I was on vacation it would not have mattered but since we were there for work it was annoying. Would I hold another event at this hotel OR another Hard Rock Hotel yes! Thanks Chicago staff for a great time."
"We arrived at Hard Rock Hotel in Chicago a couple of hours before check-in and were pleased to find out that we could check into our upgraded room immediately. I was traveling with my teenage children and they loved the hotel. We had a great view, comfy beds, a spacious room, and my son loved that he could hook up his iphone to the speaker bar in the room. We also enjoyed seeing the music memorabilia on each floor.The hotel was very convenient for the river cruises, Magnificent Mile, Navy Pier (trolley access nearby), Millenium Park, The Art Institute, etc. - all were an easy walk from the hotel.Walgreens was across the street and several quick-service restaurants were nearby.The only flaw to the entire stay was that we didn't find out about the guitar program until too late!"
"After travelling for 10 hours we arrived at the front desk of the Hard Rock Chicago 3 hours before our scheduled check in and were thrilled to hear they could get us in a room right away, originally booked in a room on the fifth floor I asked the girl at check in if it would be possible to have a room a higher floor for a better view and less noise, again we were pleased when re- booked to room 2202, the highest level of the main building before the tower rooms.We didn't need baggage service but were still warmly greeted by the bell hop in the elevator as he was delivering luggage to another room, he was very personable and talked to us of his Canadian girlfriend and had even visited our hometown.Our room was cool in it's vibe but a little warm in temperature I believe the thermostats are on program we were unable to set them to cool in the heat of the afternoon so we just kept the curtains drawn and the sun out, the bathroom was modern, the tub was clean, the water pressure was good, the sheets were soft and the TV reception was clear. I believe the decor and ambiance worked for the theme of the Hard Rock, but I would have liked it to be more brightly lit especially in the bathroom, even with both ceiling pot lights and the glow of the magnifying mirror I found it dim for getting ready in the morning.We loved the location of The Hard Rock right on Michigan Ave close to the river, a moment to high end shopping, around the corner from great restaurants, and across the street from Grant/Millennium park. We found on the Hard Rock facebook page that the city shows movies at the Pritzker pavillion in the park on Tuesday evenings it was a highlight of our trip and we were glad to be so close that we could enjoy the movie. We found all the staff we came in contact with to be great and helpful it's a gift to be both ""Chill"" and efficient but they seem to have it down pat. Kudos to the front desk staff, concierge team and bellmen.We really enjoyed our visit to Chicago and our experience at the Hard Rock hotel and have already recommended that our friends and family look into booking there if they find themselves visiting the windy city."
"The hotel is really beautiful, well accommodated, but the staff's attention to customer service was just horrible. Management needs to take some serious customer service centered training. I arrived at 12:35 in the middle of the night. The ticket was bought by the company I was consulting for. It was done through Orbiitz. Who also shares some fault here too. I was told I could not check in because the person's name who made the reservation was listed. Despite all the reservation materials were sent to me, as the primary traveler, and my name was listed on the reservation. Despite all this, I was told by the clerk I had to call the person and ask permission to use the room. Seriously, I have the home phone number of a secretary to call past midnight to ask permission? I looked at him and asked ""are you really asking me to call a person past midnight, as if I even have their personal phone number. Then he said that there was no other way,.sorry, nothing else I can do. I looked at him and told him that I had a 7:30 meeting and I am not going to stand here and debate the issue, just find a way.So he called Orbitz, and said to me, this might take a while, so have a seat and relax. Really? Its 1am by now, I just worked a long day at the office, and then was travelling for 6 hours and, had to wake up at 6am, no, I said, I am not going to relax and it cannot ""take a while"". I decided just to give him 10 more mins to figure it out. At which time, it is now closer to 1:15am, and I said, sorry, time is up, this is a nice hotel, you cater to business travelers, find out a better solution, hold the room under my credit card, whatever, I don't care, just get me in a room. 10 more minutes and he finally contacted Orbitz and they resolved the issue. Nicely, he upgraded the room, but I didnt really care, all I wanted was a bed to sleep. The loss of the hour of sleep really trashed my next day.So no, I am not happy at all. This is not the clerk's fault, it is clear he was ""just following orders"" and was not given sufficient authority to use the ""Nordstrom philosophy"", customer is always right, care for the customer first. They failed at this. Michael Hatzakis"
"I loved the location!!!!! I would stay there again, no doubt.It is located in my favorite part of the city 2 blocks from Michigan Ave.and Rush street.Everything about this hotel was great from the friendly greetings as we came and left,to the delicious breakfast we enjoyed at the restaurant located in the hotel.We also enjoyed a glass of wine in the comfortable bar area.The hotel was kept up with interior decor and was nice and clean"
"We were very pleased with every aspect of our stay at The Talbott. It was very convenient to shopping and restaurants, as well as to public transportation. There were so many little amenities from the extended shampoo and soap offerings to umbrellas for the rain and even chocolates at turn down. The room was quiet and we never heard noise from other rooms. The staff were all extremely friendly and greeted us each time we walked by them."
"My 11-yr-old son and I came to town as part of his Spring Break and wanted to see and do as much as we could. The Talbott was perfectly located and the price for the quality was outstanding. Traveling with a kid did mean that it was nice to have a Chic-Fil-A within easy walking distance, but we found several other mid-range eateries that served the less sophisticated palate. We also ate in the hotel restaurant and enjoyed it. We were able to walk to many sites and activities or take a very quick Uber or even the ""L"" or a bus. A park and library just 2 blocks away, walkable streets and sidewalks and, of course, my son loved seeing all of the high priced exotic cars valet parked for the shoppers on the ""Magnificent Mile."""
"The Talbott has for years been one of our favorite hotels and the location is perfect for us. It's always clean, comfortable, and very quiet. However, the past couple of stays have lacked a bit in late night room service (re: kitchen). During the most recent visit some items were forgotten at delivery, though the kitchen did make good on it. The note, chocolates, and room category upgrade were very much appreciated for my birthday weekend. This hotel has very friendly & helpful staff, especially the doormen and concierge.


Room Tip: Street-view rooms in this hotel typically allow for more light.

"I stayed here for four nights on business. This is a great hotel. A+ and 10 out of 10 on all levels:Welcoming and friendly staff. Cannot stress how pleasant and accommodating the staff all were. Great rooms with overflowing amenities (Molten Brown toiletries, Keurig, Apple TV, etc.)The towels are amazing - seriously. Room service was great. Food was handled by Mercadito the restaurant attached. It is a Mexican restaurant. Guacamole was incredibleReally a top-notch place hidden on Delaware Street near the John Hancock bldg. Not pretentious like some of the bigger-name brand hotels and not so hip I felt old walking in (i.e. no club music pumping on the speakers). And no nickel and diming customers here (free wifi, no ""resort"" fee, coffee in room, and great concierge)Great location too. Two blocks from the Red Line subway. Took that in from O'Hare and door to door was 45 minutes (and $5).I will definitely stay here again when I return to Chicago. This is a well run property on top of its game."
We have just returned from a two night stay at Talbott. what a great hotel! It is very well located and the staff are super friendly. We had booked a king room which wasn't ready when we arrived. Once the manager realized that the room won't be ready by 3 he upgraded us to a 1 bedroom suite instead of asking us to wait. Really enjoyed our stay and wouldn't hesitate to book our next stay in Chicago with them.
"Stayed at the Talbott House for our very first trip to Chicago. Found a great price for it and the location was excellent. Our king sized bed was very comfortable and the housekeeping outstanding. At the front desk, Brian Smith greeted us warmly and sincerely each time we left/returned. He made us feel like friends, not guests, and I hope he gets recognized for his wonderful demeanor.I have already recommended to a friend this wonderful establishment."
"I cannot say enough positive things about The Talbott hotel. This was our first time staying here and found it via TA and other online reviews. We also got a great rate because they had a promotion with a discount for 3 or more nights. The staff here is super professional and very polite and helpful. We had a room with two queen beds and the room was large and spacious. Everything is impeccably clean and well maintained. It felt rather luxurious and the location is fantastic -- on a very quiet street but with good access to downtown Chicago. We did not try the hotel restaurant but there is a Starbucks on the corner near the hotel for morning coffee and a Pain Quotidien next to the hotel. One of the best things about this hotel is the staff who are always so polite and pleasant. The only negative thing at all I can say is that the valet and parking charges are steep at $60 per day, and on one occasion when I called down for the car they forgot to tell the valet and therefore we had to wait about 20 more minutes to get the car when we were already on a tight timetable. They were very apologetic. I really like this place and would make it a priority to stay here again when in Chicago."
"This won't be a long review, but it will be very accurate based on the stay my wife and I just completed. We had a 2-night stay in room 504 for our wedding anniversary, and the folks at the Talbott NAILED it for us!Before our visit I e-mailed the hotel letting them know of our occasion. When we arrived, we'd been automatically upgraded to a suite at no additional cost. On top of this we had a hand-signed card from management and a box with 4 red-wine and chocolate truffles...yum!As for the room.....perfect! GREAT bed, nice robes and complimentary slippers, beautiful bathrooms with luxurious amenities, Kuerig coffee maker, and a quiet, peaceful, magnificently appointed room that made it an A+ in my book.Yes, parking over $60 per night plus tips in silly, but it IS downtown Chicago and nearly everywhere is a gigantic rip-off. We loved our stay and would do it again in a heartbeat! BRAVO TALBOTT!!"
"Honestly I will preface by saying I am more of a big chain hotel than a boutique hotel guy, mostly due to predictability and getting certain ammenities due to my status, so I wasn't super excited when my meeting was booked at this hotel, however everything about this hotel was excellent. Staff from the doorman to the cleaning staff were super friendly and always took the time to say hello, the in room ammenities were very good, with the one possible addition being complementary bottled water in the rooms, but honestly other than that there is nothing more I could ask for."
"I'm so glad I read through the reviews on Tripadvisor and selected The Talbott Hotel. We enjoyed a wonderful stay at this charming boutique hotel. Location is superb and the service was exceptional. Our room was a nice size, well appointed & very clean. I appreciated the free wifi service and enjoyed being able to use the apple keyboard w/TV as personal computer. We did not have a ""room with a view"" but it certainly didn't matter with all the other fine amenities. Don't think I would want to ever stay anyplace else in Chicago!"
"This hotel is a nice place to stay in a great location. It is well managed and the staff is very nice. Our room was large and the bed was good. We booked the least expensive room, which I do not recommend doing. These rooms either have a view of a brick wall, which I suppose is not so bad if you are out all day...or worse the back of the Waldorf Astoria. The problem is that you will wake up 6:30 am to the sound of deliveries and garbage trucks. This noise continues all morning, even on the weekends. We moved to a higher room, and it was better, but still not restful. We would stay here again, but we would pay for a room with a view of the street, which is quiet. On our last visit to Chicago we stayed at the Thompson (eat at the restaurant, Nico), which was great but more than twice the price. Also take into consideration that Chicago hotel taxes are in the neighborhood of 17%-- causing sticker shock when the bill comes.

We stayed in Chicago for part of our honeymoon and when we told the front desk we were upgraded to a gorgeous suite! Bigger than our first apartment and the staff was stunningly helpful! They gave us fabulous recommendations for food and it's in walking distance of the magnificent mile and everything else. They have a great special if you stay with Amex through the website you get a night free which was lovely. Fabulous stay and would love to come again
"Nestled in between the big name player hotels on Chicgo's Gold Coast is the little hotel that could. The Talbott is an absolute pleasure to stay in! Large, spacious rooms, newly updated bathrooms with separate shower and deep soaking tubs, free internet and staff that absolutely bend over backward to be helpful, this is just a wonderful place to stay smack dab in the center of the action. Possibly because of all the chain hotel competition each way you look, the Talbott has to try really hard to get noticed, and try it does... Great prices...and great comfort make this place the only one I will ever stay in when returning to Chicago!"
"We always stay at the Talbot and have been for years.The Talbot is a unique experience. It removes you from the hustle and bustle of the big name hotels in the area. It is literally 60 paces from the Sofitel and a few more steps to designer shopping, restaurants etc. To me It is the best location you could have in Chicago. You are a a couple of blocks from Michigan Avenue and great shopping to east. To the north you are a couple of blocks from Lou Malnati's Pizza, the best deep dish in Chicago, or Gibson's Steak House to name a few. The shopping in the area is boutique based with Department stores thrown in the mix down the Miracle Mile. If you are or have a doll collector in the family, American Girl is just a few steps away. Whether you are here in the summer of winter it is a great place. Peaceful, quiet and relaxing. When you walk into the hotel it is an instant calm unlike the hustle and bustle of the loud convention style hotels. The staff is extremely personable. The doormen are polite courteous and respectful and just plain friendly. The atmosphere is a throw back to the elegance offered in premium hotels in past decades. Two Fireplaces flank the entrance and are as inviting as their sitting area is warm. Quality furniture and detail in each and every room. 42"" televisions and in the Suites you have access to a Mac Mini which runs TV and Internet. Regular rooms are well appointed. King Suites include a beautiful Bedroom, Separate TV Lounge/Meeting room with Desk and pull out couch. Bathroom has both a tub and separate shower with his and hers makeup/shaving sink or vanity areas. A feature i really enjoy is the separate heating unit that can be turned on in the very large bathroom to make it more comfortable when getting out of the shower. All totaled I am guessing you have about 800 square feet including the main foyer entrance area. Very comfortable. It has been recently upgraded. I prefer the old decor, but honestly this new decor is equally as nice. The in suite decor is far from dull with room accents and appointments in every room adding the decorators touch and feel to each room. The Beds and pillows are not worn. They are plush, comfortable, clean and always refreshed.Bottom Line Great Hotel, Great Value, Great Location and Great people. Do yourself a favor and stay at the Talbot.

"My wife and I spent the weekend here for a little getaway after the holidays. The hotel and staff exceeded our expectations! This is the best hotel experience we have had in recent memory. The attention to detail and the helpfulness of all the staff during our stay was great. The room was very comfortable and well maintained. We where really impressed, and that's not an easy thing to do. The location is also very good, away from the crowds on Michigan Ave. but within easy walking distance. There is a good choice of restaurants within walking distance, along with things to do. We also used the Chicago bus system and taxis. Had no problem getting where we wanted to go. We definitely plan on returning soon."
"This is a great hotel!! My husband and I stayed last May for a long weekend and we thoroughly enjoyed our stay! The location was wonderful and easy to walk to everything that we did. The bed was comfortable and the room was cozy, but not too small. Everyone was happy and the feeling in the hotel was very welcoming, even though it was unseasonably chilly outside. I can't wait to schedule our next trip and stay at The Talbott!"
"Super stay during a cold freeze. From the moment you pull up Dwayne and Charles welcome you and offer a lively, inviting and incredible atmosphere. The hotel is classic but well maintained. Rooms are nice and well appointed. The bathroom in the King Parlor room was quite large along with the room. Beds are nice and comfortable. The internet was acceptable. The location is great. The hotel is located in a good spot right near Michigan avenue. It is within walking distance of lots of shop, restaurants and the subway. This hotel is a gem in Chicago and you will absolutely enjoy the stay. On top of it all we were given the latest check-out we have ever experienced. This is clearly one of the best hotels in Chicago.

"My spouse and I spent 16 nights at the Talbott Hotel over the Christmas holidays. From the door staff, to the front desk, cleaning staff and concierge, the service was outstanding! We always received a warm welcome every time we returned from a day or evening out. Gene, the concierge, was excellent and gave us great tips on things to do and places to eat. We always made a point of stopping in and chatting about our experiences... he was so much fun! All of his recommendations were top notch. Tim was also great and very helpful when we had questions. Dwayne, the door staff, warmly greeted us every day and always had time to chat and help us out with anything we needed, especially when we first arrived. This was definitely one of the best service experiences I have had staying at a hotel. The rooms were clean and spacious with lots of little amenities, and the location close to everything... just a few blocks from the redline and buses. I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone, and it will be the place I book when I come back to Chicago. Thank you to everyone at the Talbott... you helped make our first trip to Chicago an amazing experience!

"Visited Chicago and stayed 3 nights at this wonderful hotel. Hotel is well-located and central to many places to visit and shop. Walking distance to major sights, including the Art Institute and downtown ""Loop"" in good weather for those who like to walk. Hotel staff - concierges, desk and door - were all friendly, competent, well-versed in answering questions and providing suggestions. They go out of their way to make you comfortable and address any need. Rooms were very nice with comfortable beds, lots of space for 2 of us, enough dressers for unpacking and bathroom had big tub. Hotel was very quiet at all times. Adjoining bar was terrific. Regrettably, we missed trying the restaurant. This was one of finest hotels I have ever stayed at. It is perfect for those wanting to sight-see, visit friends or family or just escape. (There isn't a pool or fitness room, but nearby privileges are made available.) Will definitely stay there again for any future visits!"
"This is our second visit to The Talbot hotel in Chicago. This hotel has a beautiful and quaint lobby featuring two sitting areas each with a fire place; beautifully decorated for the holidays. It is on Delaware which is a unique street off the beaten path not too far from great shopping and dining on Rush, State or Michicgan Avenue and other side streets which off some unique boutiques, antiques and cafes. Their staff, from the doormen to the concierge, are always pleasant and personable without being intrusive. The rooms are reasonably priced featuring some ornate and appealing European decor and each room is quite spacious and very quiet. Once you check in, you do not need your vehicle to enjoy the shopping, dining or people watching of some of the unique shops, cafes and nite life -- or stay in your room, visit the lobby and people watch or enjoy dinner at their in new restaurant located on the main level. We did not eat at their restaurant this time but would not hesitate to try it on our next visit. The restaurant name and style did change from our prior visit in 2013 -- and it was an enjoyable experience --- so I have no doubt the new restaurant is a unique and enjoyable experience with the convenience of being in the hotel.

"We've stayed at the Talbott the last several years for a winter weekend getaway to Chicago. The Talbott is a charming, intimate boutique hotel. The experience begins with the doormen, who greet you with a warm smile - Charles always greets us with a friendly ""welcome back."" The bellman are accommodating and prompt - Perry always makes sure our bags are in our room within minutes of our arrival. The desk staff and concierge ensure all your needs are met. The same staff have been at the Talbott over the years we've been coming, a testament to the stability of the management.The rooms are warmly decorated and recently renovated. We've stayed in king room and one-bedroom king suites. We prefer the space of the suite, which has a large bathroom with tub, shower, and two sinks (one with a dressing table). The living room has plenty of space for the large sofa, two stuffed chairs, and a large desk. The Talbott is a short walk from Michigan Avenue and Oak Street shopping, Rush Street restaurants, and many other Chicago amenities. Yet, the Talbott is just off the main streets in a (relatively) quite location.

"The weekend after Christmas, my wife and I stayed at the Hotel Talbott in Chicago. The hotel was clean and elegant, with a great location with a very quick walk of Rush Street and Michigan Avenue, but what really set the hotel apart was the incredible staff. From the moment we were dropped off at the curb, every employee of the hotel was friendly and willing to go beyond what I would consider the call of duty. I mentioned in passing that it was my wife's birthday, and they sent up a card and a box of truffles thanking us for spending the special occasion with them. I do not have a single complaint about the hotel, and I do not hesitate to give it my strongest recommendation."
"For our long weekend trip to Chicago, I was hoping to find a hotel that I wouldn't have to pay $300-$400/night and would be close enough to walk to most of the sights along Michigan Ave. We had a great stay at The Talbott. The staff was very friendly and helpful, the location was perfect, and the rooms were just right for our needs. We spend very little time in our rooms when we travel, so it is just a matter of a good jumping-off point and comfortable accommodations. We were traveling with our nearly-adult children, so I booked two rooms (a king and double queen), and they conveniently located us around the corner from each other. I had seen so many review comments about Dwayne, and now I see why. Gave us great ideas on places to eat for breakfast and lunch. The location is 2 blocks from the John Hancock Building and 360 Chicago, and is perfect for Michigan Ave. shopping. You won't go wrong by staying here. Highly recommended.

"My wife and I stayed at the Talbot the weekend of 12/26/14-12/18/14. Overall, it was a positive experience. The doorman quickly helped my wife out of our cab and had our luggage on a cart before I paid the driver. He welcomed us with a warm, enthusiastic greeting and ushered us to the front desk. We arrived appx. two hours before check in but this was not a problem at all. This was when things interesting.  The bellhop took our luggage from the doorman and said he would be happy to take our things to our room once check in was complete. We had reserved a standard king room and decided against the $60 per night upgrade that was offered to us. We were handed our room keys and told where our room was by the very friendly and efficient receptionist but the bellhop had vanished. Not spending for the upgrade so not worthy of bellhop service? I picked up our luggage from the cart and headed up to our room. When we opened the room we decided that the upgrade would be worth it. The room was small and the view was of a wall and fire escapes of the property next door. We called down to the front desk and requested the upgrade after all which was handled easily and our new room keys were waiting for us by the time we reached the lobby. So to was the previously elusive bellhop. Hmmm. Everyone else at the Talbott was wonderful. The front desk people always said hello when we were coming or going and the doorman was quick to hale a cab or assist with directions if we were walking. We did not eat in the restaurant, but I did have coffee there this morning and again I was met with warm greetings. The lobby has rich wood decor and two fireplaces surrounded by furniture that beckon you to sit, relax, and enjoy the space.  The Talbott is closely surrounded by taller building so if you want a room with a view, this would be a poor choice. The rooms are quiet though and kept very clean by an attentive housekeeping staff.

"Needed a break from our routine, so we took the kids (14 & 17) for an overnight stay in downtown Chicago. Used Trip Advisor to aide in hotel selection and as usual we were not disappointed! The Talbott was warm and cozy. The staff was friendly and welcoming. Dwayne was particularly charming and helpful. Very clean, quiet, and comfortable. Easy access to tons of shops and restaurants. Able to park a block away for $41.00 after validation from the hotel (parking not my favorite part of visiting downtown Chicago as we spent over $100.00 for parking over 2 days between the Shedd, Navy Pier, and the hotel). We would definitely stay there again next time!"
"The Talbott is home away from home. From the minute you walk in there is an inviting atmosphere that makes you feel like you never want to leave. The hotel was decorated for be Christmas holidays, with two fireplaces. The fireplaces and lounge area around them were great to warm up with a glass of wine. The staff is superb, very accommodating. They were able to accommodate my very early check in. Gene the concierge was excellent, was extremely nice and had great suggestions on places to go.The hotel has an old worlds charm, loved all the wood finishes and the vintage decor. The rooms are cozy, and very comfortable. They have Apple TV and also control the in room computer. I found this very helpful. The Keurig machine was an added plus, very easy to use and convenient. Overall a great experience and great hotel. Can't wait to come back. Definitely my home away from home when I visit Chicago."
"We were in Chicago for three days and chose this hotel because of the previous reviews and the fact we like smaller hotels. This hotel was wonderful! Every employee was friendly and helpful. There was some confusion about the parking charges and because of that, they adjusted our bill. To be clear, as of the date of this review, the valet parking is $58 a day. The self parking is $41 a day. The garage is around the corner from the hotel and is probably a three minute walk. We were offered an upgrade to a suite but decided not to take advantage of it because we were only going to be there another day. The turn down service was a special little treat - especially the chocolate on the pillow. The room was large and nicely decorated. The hotel was close to everything. We didn't drive our car during our stay since there were great restaurants within walking distance and sightseeing was within a mile or so. We love Chicago and we'll definitely stay here on our next visit. And kudos to whoever is in charge of customer service training! Whatever they're doing is working."
"We stayed here during our first visit to Chicago last month. It suited our purposes to a tee. The location is perfect for exploring all the ""must do"" sites. It is withing walking distance of the waterfront, shopping, tours, restaurants, and major museums. The neighbourhood is quiet, yet busy and near all the amenities you need. As a boutique hotel, The Talbott doesn't have the conference and meeting facilities larger properties do, it compensates for this with superior service, excellent accommodation, and delivers great value. The concierge and front desk personnel are particularly effective, but all staff are excellent."

"Unbeatable value in the heart of Chicago, 2 blocks from Michigan Ave close to great bars and restaurants. Friends stayed at the Four Seasons down the street and didn't feel as pampered as we did at The Talbott. Everyone who crossed our paths in this hotel was super friendly and helpful, it was obvious they enjoyed and took pride in their work. If you want a high end experience without sticker shock this is the place to stay in Chicago in my opinion. We will return! On as side note, my husband left his jean jacket over a chair at the restaurant the morning we left and they mailed it to us in Canada, how nice is that?


Room Tip: we stayed on the 10th floor near the elevators facing E. Delaware Ave. it was very quiet

"Everything was excellent, from the fantastic valet service when I first checked in, to the final departure. The staff is superb: friendly, concerned and efficient. The room was an absolutely stellar suite: large living room with wet bar and separate desk area, a large foyer, a huge bathroom (separate tub, shower and commode room with two separate vanity areas) plus a large bedroom. Just a block and a half from the Mag Mile, it's right at the heart of it all!"
"GREAT boutique hotel. We have been looking for alternative accommodations for our annual trek to Chi-town and Duane, Gene and the ladies at the Reception area wow'ed us. For this special occasion, our SUITE was one of the best we have EVER stayed in; clean, neat, sleek, quiet and refreshing. The location is fabulous, walking distance to shopping, dining and live music. No question, we'll be back, so save us a place!


Room Tip: We were on 12, facing the street, and had no problems.

"Look no further for the best hotel in Chicago! The staff was wonderful --friendly , yet professional. They even allowed us an early check in. The double queen room was the perfect size with room for 2 chairs to view the television. The location is what I loved. It felt like a neighborhood hotel. It is close enough to walk to Michigan Avenue and be in the hustle and bustle of the big city, but turn in a different direction and you can be in a charming neighborhood in 2 blocks. I can't imagine staying any where else . Well done!"
"After deciding on a whim to go to Chicago for the night, we booked the Talbott based on the great reviews on Trip Advisor and the reasonable price for a quality hotel and couldn't have been more pleased with our decision. The decor is on the traditional side, but very elegant and comfortable, not stuffy. The staff are incredibly friendly; when checking in we mentioned that this was our first stay at the Talbott and received an upgrade to a one bedroom suite! The room was 700 square feet with a huge, luxurious bathroom and very comfortable bed and pillows. The toiletries were also wonderful (and smelled awesome). Very central location as well with fabulous shopping and restaurants within walking distance. Would highly recommend the Talbott."
"My husband surprised me with a 50th birthday extravaganza in downtown Chicago. He chose the Talbott as our lodging destination. The recent renovation provided exquisite, yet comfortable accommodations. The staff was friendly & helpful in planning an eventful weekend. The location is within walking distance of fine dining, shopping & the lakefront. Having stayed in several of Chicago's 5 star...

"We visited Chicago for the first time for our anniversary and stayed at the Talbott on the recommendation of a friend for three nights. What a find! This is truly a fantastic boutique hotel situated in the Magnificent Mile area which offers excellent sightseeing, shopping and walking tours. The staff was friendly and accommodating, the concierge service first class, Mercadito restaurant dining very good, the rooms clean and well appointed and the location perfect.We will stay at the Talbott on our next trip to Chicago and will definitely recommend it to our friends."
"I took my goddaughter (14 yrs old) to Chicago for one of our city tours we choose each year as we explore great cities in the US. The Talbott met all my expectations and more. The rooms were larger than most you will find. We had a double queen room that was spacious and well appointment with WiFi on the television so we didn't even have to pull out our computer. The bed was just right with lovely comfortable bedding and pillows that were not too soft and just enough support and dust mite free (not pink eyes in the morning). The location was wonderful with easy access to within walking distance of two major restaurant neighborhoods, weekend outdoor market, an awesome little grocery store and the magnificient mile and the hop on hop off bus. My goddaughter particularly like the near by outdoor gelato and juice bar near Carne's restaurant just 2 blocks away. The staff were very friendly, personable and accomodating. The concierge made all our reservations and even got our boarding passes in the middle of the night and printed and delivered them under our door. We had showers on our last day and though it was wonderful trying several great restaurants in the area, we popped into the seafood restaurant in the hotel and had a very good meal before heading to the airport. Enjoy, eat and relax."
"I picked the Talbott on the basis of the reviews I read here, and we couldn't have been happier. Our room was spacious, nicely appointed and immaculately clean, with very comfortable beds. My daughter and I liked the make-up mirror in the bathroom, and we all appreciated the plush towels and bathrobes. We were on the top floor but we did not have a view. That was not a major concern as we didn't spend a lot of time in the room. The concierge was very helpful in providing advice; we particularly appreciated her tip to visit the top of the nearby John Hancock building rather than stand in line at the Sears Tower. Somehow it came up in our conversation that I'd had a birthday recently, and soon a card and some chocolates were delivered to our room. Each time we entered the hotel the desk staff welcomed us back and asked how our day had been - and they were sincere about it! The location of the hotel is very convenient. We would most definitely stay there again."
"I booked a trip to Chicago for my husband's 40th birthday. I chose the Talbott based on Trip Advisor reviews, and was not disappointed. The staff was lovely, they recognized my husband's birthday with an upgrade to a beautiful suite, a birthday card, and a small gift of chocolates. The front desk staff, bellmen and housekeepers were uniformly kind, friendly and helpful. The room was incredibly clean and comfortable, provided robes were thick and comfy, and the TV even included a linked computer for web browsing. The location was great--only a couple of short blocks to shopping on the Magnificent Mile, the John Hancock Building, and the American Girl Place (if that is your thing). There is also a CTA Red Line stop a few blocks in the other direction. Easy access to the Loop, it is walkable in nice weather.I highly recommend a stay here. My only suggestion is that the hotel improve their website--it was hard to tell what the amenities were from the website only."
"Dwayne and the rest of the team at The Talbott Hotel were fabulous! We traveled to Chicago to celebrate my dad's 60th birthday, and we could have asked for a better place, staff or suggestions from concierge and other staff members. We were walking distance to the metro and fun activities. We received recommendations on great restaurants, blues clubs, and other activities (besides baseball, because we already had tickets to both Chicago teams' games). Thanks so much to the staff at The Talbott, and especially Dwayne!"
"I stayed here for nine nights in July 2014 as part of two months' travelling in the USA. It has to be the best hotel I've ever stayed in. Great location. I walked happily to most places I wanted to visit, feeling safe even at night. Good public transport took me further out of the city. You really don't need a car here.My room (at the back) was quiet and extremely comfortable. Everything worked. The service was up to old world standards for the serious traveller - no do-it-yourself technology here; while the internet, television and office technology were bang up-to-date. My plaudits to all the staff - who seemed to enjoy working here - and especially to the concierge who ensured I missed nothing I would enjoy. I left here to go camping in the deserts of Utah and Arizona, well-prepared and rested before the trek. I wish I could have found somewhere as perfect to recover afterwards.I arranged the stay at a bargain price at the last minute, and felt guilty that I had paid so little for so much."
Had a wonderful stay at the Talbott. The Hotel is charming and the room very well appointed down to the Molton Brown lotions and soaps which were yummy. Everyone was helpful and friendly. The location is perfect for strolling the tree lined streets and looking at Chicago's architecture. I hated to leave. This will be my go to place whenever I am in Chicago.My only suggestion would be more plugs near the bed for charging devices. Can't wait to go back!
"We stayed a full week in Chicago and couldn't have been more happy staying at The Talbott. Our deluxe king suite on the 14th floor was very well appointed; we particularly liked the large flat panel T.V. which included a fully operational Mac computer; this gave us access to anything we wanted on the internet, even our Netflix account! The furniture was a bit dated but the king bed was very comfortable and the bathroom had two sinks with a shaving mirror which my husband really liked! The staff at the front desk and elsewhere were just so friendly and helpful. We didn't eat at the adjoining restaurant but did have some drinks there; the rates were typical Chicago downtown rates...quite expensive. We enjoyed breakfast at the newly opened ""Le Pain Quotidien"" just down the street at the corner of State Street or at the Tempo restaurant just over on the next street on Chestnut. What we enjoyed the most about the Talbot is its location being so central to everything. Close to the magnificent mile, Oak Street Beach and then to the Red ""EL"" line and buses which can lead you to the Chicago River south or to Wriggly Stadium north...We thoroughly enjoyed our stay.

"I cannot say enough about this hotel and its staff. I came to Chicago to celebrate my son's twenty-first birthday. I had spoken to Tim, the concierge, during the prior week to make some birthday arrangements and he also set up car service from the airport.. The lobby is warm and beautifully furnished. The room and bathroom were elegant and impeccable. The overall feel of the hotel is European right down to the charming and welcoming sidewalk cafe with colorful flower boxes. But the service was all-American in the best sense - warm, friendly, client-focused and 1st class!! I arrived very early and went out to shop but I received a text to let me know that my room was ready by 11:30 and was given an upgrade to a lovely 1 bedroom suite -- quite wonderful! When my son arrived from work everyone knew his name and did every thing they could to make our time and celebration special. And it was. The staff was outstanding - I actually had the feeling that they enjoy working there and enjoy people! They seemed to treat every person with attention and concern for their comfort. Special thanks to Tim, Dominique, Perry, Jamil to name a few but all were superb. A word about the location -- we loved it. Took great walks everywhere and it is right around the corner from Gibsons and the Magnificent Mile. At the end of the stay my son and I agreed that it had been one of our nicest times ever and that the Talbott atmosphere and hospitality was a big part of it. I look forward to another stay."
"We stayed 3 nights this past weekend in celebration of my 40th Birthday. All I can say is ""wow!"" From the minute we checked in until the minute we left, our stay was PERFECT. I have never stayed at a hotel and NOT found something wrong so this hotel does EVERYTHING right. I wanted for nothing.....everything I needed was already in my room. All of the staff were friendly and personable. Special thanks to Kenneth Wells for handling my reservations."
"The hotel has the feel of a different era. Wood paneled walls and elevator. Old fashioned charm. Very comfy beds. Quiet location but very close to world class shopping and great restaurants. Also, close to Chicago's red line for easy commute. Concierge and front desk were super helpful with suggestions for sightseeing and directions. This is minor but I had a hard time keeping the floor dry with the terry cloth curtain on the outside of the shower curtain.


Room Tip: I always try to get a room away from the elevator.

"My husband and I celebrated our 20th Wedding Anniversary in Chicago at the Talbott. Tim, Gene, the front desk staff, guest services, and the restaurant staff treated us like a king and queen. We had such a fabulous time, we've decided to make this a yearly trip. We loved our stay and experience at the Talbott. It's walking distance to all the main attractions, which was great. We will always remember the Talbott, and the invaluable food, sight seeing, and other suggestions made by their staff. It made our vacation one of a kind. I will definitely stay at the Talbott every time I visit Chicago."

Wonderful and helpful staff ,would stay again, clean, friendly, star bucks on corner and lovely breakfast and lunch opposite corner, walk to 900 shops, state street, taxi cabs abundant, so extremely happy.

The surroundings and fit out were very classy and everything was presented beautifully. The in room Apple control centre (including full computer facility with wireless keyboard) is a great addition to any room was very welcome to travellers who wanted to research their itinerary each day. The room, a king luxury deluxe, was very well appointed had very comfortable furnishings all in very good condition.

"I had never been to Chicago before I went to a conference there in July. The attendees were all booked into The Talbott. I had a very large room on the top (16th) floor. View not great, but the room had a very comfortable king bed, a couch and matching chair, TV (never turned it on), writing desk and chair, large bathroom with great big Egyptian cotton towels, a large closet and small personal safe. I hurt my knee while at the conference (in another location), and the helpful staff provided me with a mound of ice and extra bags so I could ice it. As usual, I lost my keys, and they were very graceful about it. There was a very nice-looking fish restaurant on the first floor, but I didn't try it. It would have been nice if there were a few more outlets close to the bed so I could plug in both my CPAP machine and my phone within reach of the bed. It was an easy walk to the lakeshore from the hotel, and less than a mile to the Chicago River for the architectural cruise that we fit in around our meetings."
"Thank you to the Talbott Hotel Staff. From our curb-side experience to luggage handing to consierge through the entire stay, we had an excellent experience. At the north end of the Magnificent Mile, food and entertainment choices were excellent. Our family had touch-points with the staff and each touch-point was very positive. Thank you Talbott Hotel staff for your wonderful service on our stay this weekend!"
"Visiting Chicago to see my son for the 2nd time in as many months, we decided to move to another part of town. My parents recommended the Talbott and were they ""spot"" on. The front desk staff were very pleasant and upgraded us to a 1 br suite (maybe because my wife's a travel agent, not sure). This boutique hotel was gorgeous, well maintained, quiet and excellent value. Beautiful lobby, restaurant, bar and the rooms are ""sweet"". All staff were very friendly and helpful with any questions. Bellman Dwayne, exceptional. It's in the middle of the nicest part of Chicago with restaurants and shopping, the beach and all within walking distance. They also give you day passes to one of the nicest gyms/spa Equinox, right around the block. Try it, you'll like it! I'd go back here in a heartbeat and will recommend this to anyone who asks. 5 star.

"My family and I recently visited Chicago and stayed at the Talbott hotel because of its wonderful reviews on Trip Advisor. We certainly were not disappointed. The location was great, one block from the hop-on-hop-off bus, 3 blocks from the Red Line ""L"", and within walking distance of many wonderful restaurants. The staff was top notch. They were helpful, friendly and efficient. The room was very clean and very comfortable and the bed and pillows provided a good nights sleep. The value was very good and we would not hesitate to stay there again. Thank you to the Talbott for a great mini-vacation."
"This is our second trip to the Talbott Hotel, a return visit. We first came in December when the weather was fierce, but returned In August because we liked it so much. Great location, a few blocks from North Michigan Avenue and Oak Street Beach. We always like to get a run or stroll along the bike path and the hotel is perfectly located for access to the lake. The doormen and front desk folks are helpful and friendly. We want to give a special shout out to Terievis, who was working the front desk and found us the most amazing room. We were frustrated after a very long drive in from O'hare but he settled us in beautiful suite. The hotel has an excellent restaurant connected with an awesome bar serving creative and delicious cocktails - super convenient. You don't have to worry about this boutique hotel having a small fitness center, Tallbott guests can use the Equinox gym just down the block. The rooms are well appointed with good water pressure, nice furnishings, and get dark and quiet at night. Rates are reasonable too. I give this 5 stars!"

"This was a surprise trip to Chicago for my wife's Birthday. Stayed two nights the first weekend in June at the Talbott. The Front staff was very friendly on our arrival. The hotel is located within walking distance to plenty of shops and restaurants. The room was a bit of a disappointment, as when opening up the curtains, our view was of a water pipe and the roof of the building next door. I decide to book a room with Talbott because of the number of great reviews it received on TripAdvisor. This is a small and older hotel. I would say that this place is a good choice overall, but not as great as the other reviews I've read. Considering the room rates and number of other hotels in the area, we'd probably stay at another hotel for our next trip."

"Beautiful facility, great service and perfect location. Great coffee and delicious breakfast. I absolutely LOOOOOVED this hotel. The room was fantastic with a large, clean, crisp and insanely comfortable bed. The check-in took a while because there was only one associate working the desk. While the hotel was pleasant the service from one particular front desk clerk was amazing. Kurtis greeted my group like we were old friends. He knew we were coming in for a corporate meeting and recognized our company. I am in the hospitality industry and by far he is one if not the BEST of the best. The next morning he was back at work again and recognized me by name. I even told him if he ever wanted to relocate to TX he was welcome to come on down. This is a wonderful place to stay for business. The staff is very friendly and efficient. The rooms are always clean and comfortable."
"The Talbot is an olde-world hotel, a step back in time; the interior lobby is very traditional. The staff are great, very professional and helpful, easily getting taxis and advising on where to go in town. The only thing is the room we were in was very dark and there was no view at all. We didn't really want to spend much time in it (even though it was very comfortable and spotlessly clean) - just a tad depressing in terms of lack of light. Would stay here again as its very handy for all attractions, shopping and eating out but would ask for a brighter room with a view.

"From the moment we checked in, the Talbott staff went above and beyond to make sure our week-long stay was top-notch. We arrived almost 3 hours early due to our flight and they handled our schedule with extreme ease and the finest hospitality. The hotel has a great location and service in Chicago's CBD, but the where it shines is in the details; turn down service with chocolates, ice delivered to your room, Apple TV and genuine staff."
"Checked in July3 until July 6. Great location one block from Michigan Ave. Excellent service from the chamber maids, front desk staff and Chef Concierge Gene Murray. Gene recommended and made a dinner reservation at an excellent French restaurant. His recommendation for breakfast and a Chinese restaurant was also good. He checked us on United and printed boarding passes. The room was very inviting, clean, large, and well stocked. Our room faced Delaware Street which is quite and pleasant. Although, there are hand rails in the shower stall I will recommend a rubber bath mat to prevent falling when showering.  I will definitely stay at Talbot in the future and recommend it to friends and family.Patrick Ayoung"
"From the time you step out of your car and are up to your room, you are greeted by the most friendly attentive staff I have seen. The neighborhood the hotel is in is beautiful and so is the hotel itself. The hotel is always spotless and the rooms are fantastic. The beds/ pillows are soft and there's a MacMini in every room for the best in room entertainment suite I've ever seen. The concierge is amazing and always helps us to discover a new fun place to visit. The Talbott hotel is fantastic and I would highly recommend it to anyone. I spent my 21st birthday here with my Mother and wouldn't rather have been anywhere else. Every worker there from the front desk to housekeeping knew it was my birthday and they really made me feel special. They are family at the Talbott and I can not wait to visit again. I have stayed at many nice hotels in Chicago and not one comes close to the Talbott's classy design, rooms, service, and full package of hospitality. Also the hotel restaurant Little Market Brasserie is great and they offer an amazing room service menu too."
"We were on a recent girls trip to Chicago and chose the Talbott Hotel based on TA reviews.Prior to arrival we asked the concierge for restaurants suggestions and provide us with a driver to meet us at Midway. They were very helpful with our requests. The hotel was lovely inside and out. They have door man service. A great restaurant and bar. The rooms were very nice. The beds were awesome! Comfy, comfy for sure. We had to have our AC adjusted because it was not cool enough. Once that was handled we were happy campers. You can not beat the location, walking distance (just blocks) from Magnificent Mile, the Hancock building, shopping, dining and more. With that being said this was a quiet hotel in the evening, no street noise, we had a room near the elevator and we never heard it. The front desk staff was awesome, especially Cameron he was a doll and so helpful.Would definitely stay here again on my next visit."
"My husband and I recently spent three nights at the Talbott Hotel and wish we could have stayed longer. The hotel is elegant and warm, with charm and character. Located just off Michigan Ave, you couldn't pick a better location. I actually left some clothes in the room and realized it after we checked out. We called the hotel and they immediately shipped my clothes to me free of charge. I'm so impressed with their customer service that this is the number one hotel I would recommend to travelers to Chicago."
"You will not find a more friendly staff anywhere in the world. Even though I might never make it back to Chicago. I feel I have friends there. From the doormen to the maids. So professional. The restaurant is also very good and priced right. The only negative was my view of a brick wall. Next time I'll request a higher room with a view.

"Following the reviews on Trip Advisor we booked this hotel and it certainly lived up to all expectations. Perfectly located for walking through Chicago, fabulous room and really helpful staff. We spent 4 nights here and enjoyed every minute. My only criticism was there was no teabags in the room and after 3 phone calls in 2 days I managed to get a couple. Bought my own box and carried them through the rest of my USA trip!!"
"Stopped here for a few nights and enjoyed our stay.Staff were as lovely as has been mentioned in many other reviews. We had a complimentary upgrade to a lovely spacious room with everything we required: safe, iron and board, sofa and easy chair, writing desk, alarm clock with lead for MP3/iPod, free wifi.The bed was heavenly - I defy anyone not to sleep well. Our room was slightly gloomy as we were facing the Waldorf which dwarfed the Talbott, so even though our room was on the top floor, the sky was completely blotted out.The location was in the north of the city, but within walking distance of many restaurants, Michigan Avenue and the John Hancock Tower for those with a head for heights.Recommended."
"My wife and I took a short vacation to Chicago and stumbled on this hotel accidentally. It was part of an airfare-hotel package booked through Orbitz at an unbelievably low price. Upon arrival we were greeted like family and treated like royalty. The hotel upgraded our room without asking, quickly issued us our keys and transported our baggage to the room in matter of minutes. The room was way beyond our expectations. I have stayed in some five star hotels in Asia that do not compare. The bed was extremely comfortable and the decor was refined and tasteful. The concierge service was wonderful as well. They were able to get us into a sold-out restaurant for Easter Sunday brunch-- no problems. The location is great as well just off the Miracle Mile. Overall, I would recommend this hotel unconditionally."
"I chose the hotel because it was in a central location and because amex had a good discount. I imagined an old school hotel from early 20th century - and having never been to chicago before it was a great introduction. The staff downstairs was very friendly and got me a wake up call and a taxi to get me on time to my 6am flight from o'hare. Unfortunately, i did not get to spend much time in the room as i only got back from dinner/club at 2:30AM and had to get at least a couple hours of sleep. I had a key card for the door, but i'm still not sure what the actual metal key was for... bathroom was very nice, but i couldn't find a toothbrush or toothpaste. overall a very pleasant experience, in a good location for a decent price."
"We have recently returned from a one week stay at the Talbott.What a fantastic hotel-great comfortable spacious bedroom, prime location not far from Michigan Avenue and the lake.Staff were excellent from the minute we arrived until we left,had a free upgrade to an executive king room and had a late check out due to our flight time.Gene the concierge was very helpful and friendly.If you want an excellent quality hotel in the centre of Chicago choose the Talbott!Thanks to all staff for such an enjoyable holiday!"
"We stayed at the Talbott on a Saturday night when meeting up with some friends in Chicago. The hotel is in a nice location, near the shops. The staff were very nice and went out of their way to help us out. The room was nicely appointed and clean. The bathroom had a separate heater (not headlamp) for warming it up when you take a shower, which was nice. Best pillows I've had at a hotel in a long time. The room was pretty expensive, but at least they automatically upgraded us to a nicer room even though I didn't even ask. No views from windows other than another building about 15 feet away."
"Every few years we go to Chicago over Thanksgiving weekend and we always stay at the Talbott. We love the location (2 blocks from Michigan Ave and close to great shopping), and always find the accommodations comfortable and the staff friendly and welcoming. Dwayne, one of the doormen, was a wonderful ambassador for both the Talbott and Chicago on this trip. He made a point to greet us each time he saw us and shared information about the area to enhance our visit. The concierge staff at the Talbott is also very helpful with suggestions, restaurant reservations and general information. The restaurant associated with the hotel was just okay, but the bar was nice and we had fun with the bartender as he suggested interesting drinks based on our particular tastes. There was also a great ""happy hour"" special that included drinks and small bites. I don't think you can ever go wrong staying at the Talbott. It's a really nice boutique hotel in a great part of town."
"My husband and I came here for our 7th wedding anniversary. Our first time in Chicago and this was a beautiful hotel. We were pleasantly greeted at the door and the front desk was very nice. They surprised us and upgraded our room, it was amazing. Everyone was very helpful and the concierge Gene was extremely helpful and made us reservations for a boat tour and helped us pick where to eat. We loved Chicago and The Talbot was a perfect match for us, great location, romantic and overall great staff. We will be back for sure!"
"The Talbott is a very nice hotel - beautiful lobby areas and well-decorated, comfortable, good-size rooms. The location is excellent. My only gripe is with the desk clerk, who directed us to Happy Hour at the adjoining Little Market, where we discovered too late that Happy Hour in Chicago doesn't mean half-price drinks, but rather half-price appetizers. I think the clerk should have made this clear to guests who are clearly tourists."

That was not a issue for me because checking in was effortless, exteremely professional & Friendly at the same time. I was very please with the customer service Kurtis provided. Wow factor. He was very apologetic and sincere about the issue. Spacious room, Comfy bed, Nice street view. The Talbott Hotel really succeed at being a hidden gem. I will return with my family in the summer."
"I love love loved this hotel. The rooms were small, but they were laid out really well. I loved that you could get online on your television and watch netflix AND they had a DVR too. We have been saying how hotels need to get DVR capabilities and to our surprise here it was. The bed was super comfortable too.The hotel was so clean and nicely decorated. All the staff were so nice and we were greeted every time we returned to the hotel. It made me feel really special. If you need a cab they will hail you one right outside the door and when you return they open the cab door and remind you to get all your possessions from the cab. This hotel thought of everything to make our stay amazing. They even provided umbrellas in the lobby if it rained, but we had amazing weather and never had to use one, thankfully. I was sad when we had to check out. We will definitely be returning to this hotel next time we are in Chicago!!


Room Tip: We had a room on the top floor and it was super quiet.

"We stayed at the Talbott Hotel nearly seven years ago, but it still sticks in my mind as being the most fantastic boutique hotel I have ever had the pleasure to stay in. It felt as though you' were staying in someone's elegantly decorated country house, with brilliant attention to detail. The rooms could not have been more comfortable. The staff could not have been more helpful (we ate at some of the best restaurants we had ever experienced thanks to the wonderful concierge's recommendation). It definitely deserves the high TripAdvisor marks and I look forward to visiting again!"
"I spent 3 nights here in May when visiting Chicago with my wife. We took a suite so this review is not for standard rooms. Hotel is very well located, close to lake Michigan, Water Tower & Magnificient Mile. If you look for a fancy design hotel, not the place you look for however all the rest is perfect. Great suite with a nice living room (including Apple Tv), comfy beds, good bathroom, low priced mini bar and very friendly staff. The hotel also has a restaurant. Try the Parfait during breakfast, very good.Nice bar to end the day with a good drink. All of this at an excellent price (compared to other hotels in the same Chicago area). I would recommend this hotel and probably come back too!"
"My wife and I spent two nights here over the Memorial Day weekend. This was our fourth stay at this lovely property and we will continue to return. We stayed in room 702 facing Delaware Place. The room was large and the restroom even larger. The towels are super sized and soft. I generally find pillows at hotels to be too hard, these were perfect for me. There is a nice little coffee setup on a table by the front door. There really should be a trash can under the table to throw the empty coffee pods away. A highlight of any stay here is the staff. This time Dwayne the doorman and Gene the concierge stood out. The location can't be beat. Michigan Ave. is just a short walk away. State St. And Rush St. are basically outside the front door. You will not regret staying here."
"The Talbott is one of the nicest independent boutique hotels I have stayed in. The service is superior to many chain or flag hotels. The location is simply fantastic and the hotel is beautiful in all areas (common space and rooms). The staff is very friendly and attentive. This is surely a small luxury hotel and a five star/diamond property. I think it is great for the business traveler, couples and families."
"We just stayed at the Talbott. It was outstanding in every respect.: the room was very attractive, the location ideal (a block from Rush and two from Michigan), the service that of a five-star hotel. The hotel is not large so that everyone identifies you by name adding a personal touch. The adjacent Little Market serves a very good breakfast.This hotel also represents very good value for the money."
"Excellent service with attention to detail. The people at the desk know you by name, and really want to make you feel comfortable. The location is perfect, with only a block and a half from N Michigan Ave. The Deluxe King room was very comfortable. We also loved the restaurant's outdoor sitting area which is perfect for enjoying a sunny May afternoon and people watching. I did that with my daughter, 10, and she loved the banana split. We were impressed by the connection to American Girl, although our daughter is too old for that."
We had the most perfect stay at the hotel. Everyone we encountered was warm and friendly. The room was one of largest of any inner city I have ever stayed at and most definitely the cleanest. One night we called the hotel at 10pm after a show we went to and they called and made dinner reservations for us. Most impressive was on our way to the show we had gotten into the cab they had waiting for us we pulled up 5 feet when we realized we forgot the tickets in the room. When my friend went back into the hotel to get them the bellman had the elevator held for her when he noticed her coming back and knew we were in a hurry! Who still does that? I worked at 2 different hotels in Chicago and have never seen such attention to detail. Hope to return soon!
"What a wonderful hotel with a great staff. We decided to spend Easter Weekend in Chicago to visit our daughter who is away at college. We definitely made the right choice in choosing to stay at the Talbot. The only thing tough about writing this review, is that everything was great so it is impossible to single out one above another. The staff was exceptional, treating us like pampered guests from the get-go, advising us on things to do, and hailing taxis for us whenever we needed one. The room was perfect and the apple mac in the room was very well received/used. Location was great too, a quick walk to the magnificent mile and aforementioned taxis picking you up right outside the door if you wished to travel further. I cannot recommend this hotel enough and will definitely consider it again whenever I am in the Chicago area."
"There is good service, great service and outstanding service....The Talbott and in particular, Terievis provided outstanding service. I showed up a day early-I hadn't changed my reservation when my plans changed. It was the week of the national restaurant show, when rooms where scarce. Trevievs not only arranged for my room, but got me the upgrade I was hoping for....For those of you who haven't stayed at this upscale boutique hotel, give it a try. You will be overwhelmed by the curtious staff who all know your name and old world charm. Truly an outstanding stay!


Room Tip: Ask for a room ending in 01 or 03, a little more expensive, but worth the money

"We travelled to Chicago with our two young adult daughters, and we all loved the Talbott, thought it was one of the best hotels we stayed in on our 7 week holiday in the US, and we stayed in some doozies. It's a lovely old lady, elegant and refined, but so comfortable, and the staff are charming. We were here for about 4 nights in January, in the middle of the polar vortex, so Chicago was FREEZING, even the locals were complaining about the cold, and the Talbott was our cosy, warm respite. It's in a brilliant location, many great restaurants in easy walking distance, and of course our girls loved the proximity to the Magnificent Mile shopping strip. We will definitely be back, Chicago is amazing and we want to see it when our eyeballs don't feel like they have frozen in our heads, and we will most certainly stay at the Talbott. It's just lovely."
"Loved this hotel. Close to Michigan Avenue -- walked everywhere (Wendella Architecture Tour, Joe's Steakhouse and Seafood, chicago q, shopping galore...).

"The location was perfect; just 2 blocks from Michigan and a short distance from very high end shopping/Gold Coast. The Little Market restaurant attached was a great place to start the day, and enjoy some refreshing beverages! We had an executive king close to the elevator (which I typically abhor) and facing the street. I thought it was going to be very noisy, but hallway noise was worse than either of those and, luckily, we had mostly thoughtful neighbors that didn't keep the conversation going too long. Our room was really big and comfortable, and the Mac mini was a great addition. I would definitely recommend this hotel."
"What a fantastic hotel! Everyone, from the doormen to the front desk employees to the concierge to the housecleaners, are very professional, efficient and friendly.

All-in-all, this hotel deserves a FIVE star rating, not four. WIll definitely stay here again if I'm ever back in Chcago... which I plan on being.... wonderful city!!"
I was in Chicago for a reunion weekend and chose the Talbott for its location. It is a charming old world hotel that has been recently renovated. I booked the B&B package which offered me a wonderful breakfast at the restaurant attached to the hotel. I was upgraded to a two queen room which is larger than the standard king. The beds were very comfortable with turn down service. The bathroom was a bit small as compared to the room but nicely appointed and a great shower! Everyone at the hotel was so friendly and accommodating. A special shout out to Dwayne the doorman - he was always smiling and greeting everyone by their name. Parking is valet and expensive - but you can't beat the location and it is Chicago. I'm sure I will stay there again.
"We stayed at the Talbott after spending a tiring couple of weeks driving across Route 66 from L.A. We were tired and cold until we pulled up out front where we were greeted by Dwayne. Dwayne had so much energy and excitement about him that we were quickly re-energised! The hotel was warm as were all the staff. It was exceptionally clean and well located. We stayed for 5 nights and made use of the gym facilities each day. Every time we returned to the hotel, whether from a workout or a day's outing we were warmly greeted and asked about our day. It felt like we were coming home each time. Dwayne really added to the vibe of Chicago for us and Gene the concierge also provided some good ideas and advice. I would definitely stay here again and would highly recommend it to others. We believe it helped make our Chicago stay very special!"
"Took my husband to Chicago for three nights for his birthday. The Talbott Hotel was the PERFECT choice. Friendly staff, especially appreciated doorman Perry's friendly advice and information. Large very clean rooms. Nice restaurant on the premises. Try the salmon breakfast! This hotel is an easy walk to restaurants and Michigan Avenue. I want to add that we travel about three months of the year, so we stay in many hotels during this time. The Talbott is a notch or maybe two above most other hotel choices. Oh, and the price is reasonable too considering the city and the location.

"This place is a winner on all levels. The location is perfect, in a nice, clean area of Chicago right near the Hancock Centre and the Miracle Mile. It is walking distance to these great attractions and the variety of restaurants nearby. The rooms are immaculately clean with a beautiful interior. We stayed on level 9 and our room was very spacious and well appointed. BUT, the real winner is Dwayne. Dwayne works at the hotel and made it his personal mission to ensure we had a great time. He was exceptionally helpful in providing us with great recommendations to eat out and always greeted us with a smile and upbeat personality. This was worth the reservation alone! Thanks to the hotel for an amazing stay in Chicago. We would highly recommend this hotel to anyone and would certainly stay here again."
"The Talbott Hotel is a lovely boutique hotel, spacious rooms, very helpful staff, attractive lobby in a wonderful location in Chicago, especially if you want to be close to Trader Joe's, Whole Foods, Barnes & Noble and within 30 or so walk to downtown Loop to theatres. My husband and I both have special, limited diets and the hotel even brought in a microwave and refrigerator to our room at no extra charge. It was enormously helpful. Having Barnes & Noble a 5minute walk from the hotel was great since it was rainy and cold and windy end of April/May1, maybe hit a record for low temps. Safe walking at night too. All in all, I'd recommend The Talbott to anyone coming to downtown Chicago, at a much better rate than the more conventional big hotels."
"There are not enough words to say how much I loved this hotel. First the basics, the bathroom was sparkling clean, the air conditioning worked perfectly, the beds were very comfortable, every lamp in the room worked (oddly enough this is something that always seems to be an issue in other hotels!). The staff is above par. They really enjoy working there, and welcome each guest like their own family. We were traveling with our two daughters and the concierge Tim, and doorman Dwayne went out of their way to make them feel welcomed! The housekeeping that was in the elevator with us was even cheerful and friendly! The location is tucked away, yet so close to everything. My husband travels very frequently for business and stays at many hotels all over the world, he said he has never had service like he has at the Talbott. Thank you and we will be back!!!"
"We stayed at the Talbott on a short visit to Chicago recently. For a hotel so close to the Magnificent Mile, the prices are very reasonable.Dwayne, who greeted us, helped with our bags, and gave us numerous recommendations, was the perfect host, and made us both feel very welcome.The hotel itself is gorgeous, the rooms lovely and comfortable, and the restaurant in the hotel (Little Market) was so good we ate there numerous times. Everything (including the cocktails) was deliciousWe've stayed at plenty of very nice hotels, and the Talbott is definitely our new go-to in Chicago. Can't recommend it highly enough."
"I have stayed at The Talbott numerous times over the years and it has become my favorite Chicago hotel. I recently stayed 3 nights and what a treat. I heard my favorite words at check-in, ""Welcome back. We've upgraded you to a suite."" The 1-bedroom suite was beautiful and exceptionally large in size. Talbott beds/bedding are some of the best I've experienced anywhere. The Talbott's location is exceptional, providing easy access to great restaurants, shops and Chicago's landmarks. Service is always high. Everything about this property makes it a great place to stay."
"We spent 10 days in Chicago on holiday. I had chosen the Talbott hotel based on reviews I had read on Trip Advisor and other websites. The hotel did not disappoint, we arrived earlier than the check in time but were given a room straight away. The hotel is located near John Hancock centre (360 Chicago) and the Magnificent Mile. This was very convenient for shopping and some restaurants. The hotel is also a couple of blocks from the CTA Red Line, which allows easier travel downtown and we used this line to travel to Wrigley Field for the baseball.The room was very spacious and very very clean. All of the staff members we spoke to and sas during our stay were friendly and always said hello and welcome back. I would highly recommend this hotel if you are traveling to Chicago."
"We thoroughly enjoys our stay at The Talbott Hotel, every time we stay. The staff is always great, awesome location, comfortable rooms, however this last stay was a bit disappointing. The issues had nothing to do with the hotel itself or it's direct staff but with the staff from the restaurant/bar little Market that is connected to the hotel. We have spent numerous stays here in Chicago visiting family and love having drinks and brunch at Little Market. I'm not sure who this gentlemen (if that's how you would like to address him) was or what his job position was with the hotel or restaurant. I have never been spoken to or disrespected by someone in my entire life. We would like to think the The Talbot Hotel would not accept this behavior in any of their establishments, especially when it is known that their guests will be taking advantage of the surrounding places. Please do not let this review sway your opinion on the hotel, but please be mindful of the service from the surrounding establishments."
"We really enjoyed our stay at the Talbott. It is located less than two blocks away from Michigan Avenue and was therefor a great jumping off point for walks down to the Bean. Our room was very large, clean and had beautiful furnishings.To top it all off, my wife left a hat in the room, which we did not discover until we got home. She called and not only did they find the hat, they sent it back at no charge! This is really going above and beyond."
"A really delightful hotel that gives excellent value for the price. It is a relatively small hotel, an older building (1940s?) that has been thoroughly renovated and modernized. Great location, a block from the 'Magnificent Mile' and close to the restaurant district.
Very gracious and helpful staff. Well equipped rooms, free Wi-Fi, very comfortable beds.

"this was my second visit to the ""Windy City"" but my first visit to the Omni. On arrival the staff were very welcoming. The rooms in the hotel are all suites, which is quite nice.The beds (queen size in my room) are comfortable and the room was kept very clean. However I did discover a pair of designer sunglasses under the couch, obviously mislaid by a previous guest!! I would prefer to have had slightly brighter lighting in the room The bar/restaurant is efficient with friendly staff. The breakfast buffet is certainly adequate.The location on the corner of W.Huron and N.Michigan Avenue is brilliant.Yes, I would recommend this hotel."
"The hotel is a great place if you want to shop. Walking distance to The Art Institute The King suite needed a few upgrades but was fine. We ate at the restuarant for one night and it was ok. There is a great breakfast place e.leaven just about a block away if you want a good bagel. There is a great Italian deli with bakery about a block away.

"The hotel was clean and very spacious. Great location, walking distance to almost everything. The bed was not very comfortable but the hotel itself was good. The staff was friendly and helpful.I would definately stay here again. The only thing I didn't like was the overnight parking rates. I know it's downtown Chicago and most things are a little pricey but when you're staying at the hotel, parking shouldn't be so expensive. It would have been cheaper to park in private lot."
"First of all; remember this is an ""expensive"" city & not your hometown hotel; expect a little ambient noise of fire engines etc--get over it. Or don't come to any metropolitan area...Overall I give this Omni high grades (not perfect-nearly so though). I want clean; it was. I want courtesy & not fawning or obsequious service; got this too. This is near luxury with reasonable rates.The Sunday morning brunch is a reasonable $30 & an extremely reasonable $14 for our grandsons too. Restaurant has expansive view of Michigan Ave from the 4 th floor perspective. We also had some nice drinks & Cognac the evening prior with nice price point."
"This is our first time at the Omni Chicago but we always enjoy our experience at an Omni. Top notch service and you should definitely become a preferred guest. You can't beat the location right in the middle of the magnificent mile, we walked to the American girl doll store and other stores several times throughout the trip. I would have definitely given it five stars except I booked the room for two adults and one six year old child yet there was only one bed in the room. We had to pay an extra $20 for the roll away bed for my daughter. It seems if they ask the number of people and ages when you book they should include the accommodations in the price of the room. Also, I had been watching the price on the Omni website as I wanted to book the American girl package but when I went to actually book the price had been raised over a hundred dollars for all the rooms. I was able to go back to Expedia and get it for much cheaper. I would expect to be able to get the cheapest price on the Omni website when logged in as a preferred member."
"Stayed at the Omni Chicago from December 19th thru the 21st and it was the best stay in Chicago I have encountered. I have been to Chicago many times, but this is my first stay at the Omni and I look forward to many more stays. The hotel and staff are wonderful. I un-expectedly received a tray with 4 delicious cake samples for my birthday free of charge and it was just so special. When in Chicago...by all means stay at the Omni. Thank you."
"This Omni continues to lack good management. Fortunately, the staff is wonderful (especially in the 626 restaurant & bar, and Mirham the doorman) which is why we return. The food & beverage is very good. The rooms are a bit weary & dreary but I understand that renovations are underway. Unfortunately, on our recent visit my request for a renovated room was ignored even though I am at the highest level of their loyalty program. The Select Guest loyalty program is no enticement to stay at an Omni."
"Hotel room was showing wear. Carpeting in poor condition. Furniture beat. TVs old. Room needs to be updated. I really like Omni Chicago. Staff is always friendly. Great location. We were initially given a 9th floor room and our reservations were for an upper floor. We changed rooms to the 18th floor. This was OK, but still not an upper floor. It was really difficult to raise and lower the window shade for the window over the bed (we had a corner room). I am 6'2"" and my wife would not be able to raise and lower without standing on the bed."
"Just finished a 3 might stay at the Omni Chicago, I chose the hotel for the location close to Michigan Avenue (Christmas shopping time), River North for the restaurants, and still accessible to the loop for my meetings. Excellent customer service, nice room, furnishings, the on-site restaurant for breakfast was excellent, used the fitness center and it was big with high quality machines. So the two problems were the internet service (I had to change rooms to get connected, and then it was slow and somewhat intermittent.) The other challenge was that the windows were drafty, and the furnace ran almost full time trying to heat the room. I finally figured out to pile the pillows against the curtains to keep the draft off the bed. Not sure if this is a problem in all the rooms, or just my King Suite, which was on the corner (what I had.) I would stay again, but maybe not in the winter.


Room Tip: My room faced south, and despite being on a low floor was quiet.

"Found a great deal through Travelzoo that includes room, parking and $30 voucher for $189. Considering the normal rate of over $250/night just for the room, I was lucky to have found this awesome deal! Being my first time in Chicago, I had no idea what to expect in the windy city. After searching through many hotel choices, I liked the Omni because it was one of the few hotels that offer a room with living area and a spacious bathroom. Most of the hotels in Chicago only had very tiny rooms with rates over $200/night. Omni hotel is located close to Miracle mile where you can also find lots of popular wine bars, restaurants and tourist attractions. If you plan on going to Chicago for business, this is a great hotel for ease of public transportation and location. The bar inside the hotel offered one of the best cocktails and desserts you can enjoy after a long day of walking around the city or after work. Service is top notch and overall everything was clean, well kept and quiet. The only downside was having to deal with small TV's in both the living area and the bedroom."
"This was my second time staying at the Omni Chicago. All the rooms are suites which I like & the staff is always pleasant. The recently upgraded the furniture in the lobby & my only suggestion would be to upgrade the rooms. The carpet was coming up in ours. The room was clean & beds were comfortable so that made up for it a little. Also, just thought the quality of the food didn't meet the price but hotel food is usually overpriced everywhere you go."
"We were greeted by the most friendly doorman! A great way to start your vacation. The bellman inside was really nice, as well. Gentleman at reception wasn't very friendly, but the woman on the phone when inquiring about wifi was so kind and helpful. Concierge was knowledgeable and enjoyed the pub he recommended. Our room is very comfortable and roomy, too. Beds were amazing, slept so good. Room clean, no view for us, but spent little time in room. Would definitely come back!


Room Tip: Ask for Michigan Avenue view!

"It has the best location just in the middle of Michigan Avenue and that was my principal reason for staying there. Rooms are very comfortable since they have a separate living room with TV. We had a bad situation when checked in since they assigned us a room on the side of the building where they did some maintenance work that day and we had no water in the bathroom and if some water came out, it was sooo dirty. After some time trying solve the problem, we had to move to another room and gave us that night free of charge. I will never understand why assign rooms where they know may have some problems and make guests go thru all this when they had empty rooms in other areas where maintenance did not affect them. It was my birthday and my husband pre-ordered a bottle of champagne to our original room for that night and by the time this ordeal finished, it was too late and we just went to sleep and had to celebrate the next day. After this, everything continued fine during our stay."
I've stayed here several times and am always impressed. The rooms are large with great views. The staff is professional and friendly. Service is spot on and the property is clean with attention to detail. Excellent location on Michigan Ave. What more can I say. Great fitness center although it was pretty warm for my run this morning. I really like this hotel and will continue to make it my first choice when staying in the city.
"We stayed here for two nights for a ""stay cation"". We had a fabulous experience. Immediately on our arrival, the bell staff presented our 4 & 6 year olds with complementary backpacks filled with crayons, activities, a few other surprises. Our kids were ecstatic! On our first night there, our kids were presented with milk & cookies before bed. What a fun treat! The room was very spacious and clean and we had more than enough room for all of us. The pool was fun and our kids loved it. Room service was excellent and the quality of the food was very good. The location is great - we made it easily here from OTC and loved being in the center of everything. We were very pleased with every hotel employee we came into contact with and loved feeling like they were happy to have our family as guests. We will definitely be staying here again!"
"Not what I'd hoped for esp since Oprah's guests used to stay here. The bedroom in our suite was freezing no matter how high we set the thermostat in the sitting room. There was old toothpaste on the sink bowl from previous guest & the sink water ran rust colored due to previous issues w/the mini fridges on that side of the bldg. Mini fridge was warm....never got cold. Pocket door kept falling off the hinge. This room def needed some new paint. Our room never got refreshed on the 2nd day even after having called to have it done. Had to call for more towels & toiletries. There was an issue w/our gift card upon check in for the room package we chose. Took 24 hours to resolve a piddly $10 gift card changing it from iTunes to a Starbucks. Parking is very expensive, but we used it. Location is perfect & customer service is very good, but will not stay here again or recommend."
"We just returned from a three night weekend stay at the Omni. This was our third visit to this hotel and the first time we brought our two small kids. We like this hotel for the Parking & Breakfast package. The sticker price may seem high at first, however, if you choose a cheaper hotel and pay extra for a full breakfast and overnight parking, the price is very similar. The Omni is located in a great location, offers very nice (suite) accommodations and the breakfast is first class. With an inviting bar as well as a pool, it's a complete experience. Upon arriving at the hotel, the valets quickly unloaded our gear and we were soon checking in and heading to our room with little delay. The kids were also greeted with mini-backpacks filled with activities...a very big deal! As we tried to turn on the lights, one of the bulbs was apparently burned out. My wife called maintenance and within a few minutes, he was there. Earlier in the day, we lost our beloved dog of nine years who was hit by a car in the AM. After dealing with the details and shock, we still headed to Chicago. In striking up a conversation with the maintenance man, we told him of the loss of our dog and our rather emotional day with the kids. That evening, upon return from dinner, we were pleasantly surprised to a tray of goodies in our room including some wine, cookies and milk, as well as a personal hand written note from the staff offering condolences for our loss. It was an absolutely well received gesture and it was heartfelt and appreciated.The Omni has a few quirks such as some maintenance needs on the fitness equipment, but it is a well run and comfortable hotel that we are certain to return to in the future.


Room Tip: We upgraded to a corner room. It isn't any bigger, but it offers a full 180 degree window view...

"The Omni Hotel never disappoints. This is probably our 7th or 8th time staying here. I especially appreciated the nice fitness facility with swimming pool. It was an unseasonably cold weekend and the fitness center was a nice alternative to exercising outdoors. As always, the breakfast offerings were wonderful. I wouldn't go anywhere else for breakfast! This time we also had a great selection of salads for lunch. We will be back!"
"You can't beat this hotel in terms of location or guest services on Michigan Avenue. Love having the suites so that my husband and I, if we are on different sleep/wake cycles, don't bother each other. Always met with a friendly smile from all of the hotel staff. Rooms are clean and maintained nicely. Parking is outrageous (typical of Chicago,) but there is a lot directly across the street for half the price. We moved our vehicle after the first night."
"We enjoyed our 3 day getaway to Chicago very much. Excellent service by all of the employees. We stayed in an Executive Suite which was worth the extra money. The room was comfortable as far as size. I understand from an employee that the rooms will be upgraded which is needed as far as furniture, carpeting, etc. It is much needed. Otherwise the rooms were very clean. Kudos to maids. The only reason I rated the hotel 4 stars is because of the rooms needed an update otherwise it was a perfect stay."
"My husband and myself had the pleasure of staying in the Omni Chicago Hotel for a week. We found the accommodation to be excellent, the bed was so comfortable, lounge and kitchenette more than met our needs. We enjoyed breakfast and found there to be a wide choice and variety. We tried different restaurants in the evening apart from one night and found the menu to be extensive.The hotel was ideally situated for shopping, sight seeing and transport links.We found all the staff to be unbelievable, from the cleaning staff to those on reception. We found them to be very, very pleasant, helpful, informatative and great 'craic'.We would highly recommend this hotel."
"Front desk and door staff were above expectations and each time we entered and exited the hotel, the front desk personnel and doormen kindly greeted us and provided us with immediate and knowledgeable assistance. Location of the hotel and fitness centre were also above expectations. Rooms were small and entertainment equipment was outdated. I have not seen such an old/poor quality TV in a 4.5 star hotel before and was a bit surprised that it would still have tube televisions. The rooms were small and furnishings were outdated."
"Granite the rooms need some updates, old t.v. in the bedroom, sitting room... chairs vs. couch etc. but overall rooms are fine. The views we had in our room were outstanding with a small view of the lake through the buildings.The location and the welcoming staff makes the Omni in Chicago a very good choice in downtown hotels. Sign up for there rewards card and get turn down service, free wifi and a beverage of you choice delivered to your room in the morning,.

"From the first moment we felt welcomed. The staff at the door, front desk, ( Nicky was so very nice), and house keeping, ( yes, we got 15 extra hangars!) made for a great stay. The staff at the door was very good in pointing us out to where we wanted to go. One time they were concerned that we wanted to walk to Second City. We did and it was just fine. On our return, they asked about it!This hotel is in a great location. The suite was well laid out and there was a lot of storage. The bathroom was a good size. Only complaint was the toilet made a weird noise. We were on the 23rd floor and street noise did not bother us at all.


Room Tip: We were on the 23rd floor and close to elevators. I cannot compare it with other rooms but if I got...

Very welcoming staff and helpful concierge. Check-in was very timely the room was very lovely. The turndown service was amazing and the young lady who did the turndown service was just the most friendly and wonderful person ever. I highly recommend this place the location is perfect and the staff goes far and beyond. I shall return and stay here again. They were also very accommodating and was able to put me in a to bed sweet when I booked a king. Just a loss of words for great service.
"When we requested a lake view they said they didn't have many. Needless to say we were delighted with a narrow slice view of Lake Michigan through some buildings! Close to many attractions and the shops on the Magnificent mile. We had the breakfast buffet which was wonderful; omelets, toast, pastries, fruit, etc. Walked to Bobby's bike rentals and the river tour! We found a trader joe's nearby (buy a reusable shopping bag as a Chicago souvenir). There is a swimming pool with two outdoor deck areas with chaise lounges. My only complaint was that the mattress pad felt a little crinkly through the sheets, my husband didn't notice."
"Stayed at Omni 3 nights last weekend. Great location for tourist: close to shopping, attractions, and CTA (train/bus). Spacious suite with 2 double beds, large bathroom, and living room. TV in bedroom and living room. Comfy bed. Would have given 5/5, but decor needs refreshed (our rug was rippled, wallpaper peeling a little).Excellent hotel staff: from check-in (they had a feather free room ready!!!), to complimentary wine in honour of our special celebration, to cleanliness throughout hotel. SPECIAL SHOUT OUT TO CONCIERGE MARCUS, who was so helpful and patient.Would recommend this to couples or families or solo traveller, and will definitely look at Omni hotel in other cities based on this experience. 4.5/5

"I walked by this hotel for 10 yrs and never thought of it as anything other than the ""official hotel of the Oprah Witney show."" I moved away a year ago and was back in town on business. My company put me the Omni and I was pleasantly surprised. (So much so that I've since stayed at another Omni in Houston -which was great!). I had a king room with a separate living area. The bed was comfortable, the pillows soft and abundant. The living area was spacious with 2 club chairs, a desk and a wet bar. The bathroom was large. My only comment to the hotel staff is turn the TVs off. The maid staff turns the TV on, tunes it to the hotel channel and leaves it on after they leave. It's left on for hours until the guest returns to the room and turns it off. Huge waste of electricity."
"This is a well located hotel for those visiting the city as tourists. Possibly not so well located for business travellers as it is two thirds of the way down the Mag Mile and therefore well outside the business district.That said the rooms are large. We had two genuine suites. With TV in both the lounge and bedroom.Staff were friendly and helpful and very easy to get too and from everything we wanted to see and plenty of food options in the area.The only factor holding back the fifth star is that wifi is a chargeable extra, which I think is very out of date, and there are not enough charging points in the room. Ended up unplugging lights to charge up phones, cameras etc. I would certainly use this hotel again."
"I stayed for a week in a deluxe suite (queen size bed). The room was on the 8th floor and thus a bit dim (the photo on the webpage is certainly a bit sugarcoating). However, cleanliness was excellent as was the quality of the matress, so the stay was quite comfy overall. All the staff was very friendly and helpful. The breakfast buffet in the restaurant was excellent. Overall I would certainly recommend the hotel."
"Love this place for traveling with family. Usually we stay at the Drake but being a historic hotel, the rooms are small and the hotel is not extremely family friendly. This place is 100% family friendly. Extra space in the suite was a great perk. Staff were always super helpful- especially the bell hop and the people working downstairs at the entrance. They even gave my children bags with goodies to keep them busy! Beds are comfortable. Bathroom was large. Wet bar as a nice perk! Just wish they had a mini fridge at no extra cost. Will stay with family again!

"Chicago was our first spot on this year's holiday. I chose the Omni because of the overall reviews, its situation right on the Magnificent Mile but mainly because our family of 5 could share a suite; this is relatively rare particularly in big cities where room size is often at a premium.The hotel was in a great spot - we were able to walk to Bobby's Bike Hike and then back from the CAF boat tour which meant that sightseeing was easy and we could also take advantage of the shops that were close by. Yes the bedroom was a little tired in places and the TV in the bedroom was pretty old but hey we were in Chicago in wonderful weather to enjoy this great city and not to sit in our room watching American television. We don't usually eat in our hotels preferring to get out and try smaller restaurants. We had planned to have breakfast in Sunny Side Up before our bike tour but were up so early that it wasn't open. We therefore took breakfast in the Omni in the fabulous 4th floor dining room overlooking the street. It was first class and well worth the money and the staff were delightful. We would definitely stay again if the chance comes up.

"All the good reviews talk about the only good thing about the hotel, the location. It's awful. It takes 10 minutes to catch the 2 different elevators required to go to the room. Broken security locks in the room, awful decorating, and what I think is a 21 inch tube television, which I cannot see from the bed very well. I am checking out today and going to find another hotel. Badly in need of a renovation, I've stayed at many great Omni Hotels."
"We spent 4 nights at the Omni Chicago in July. Hotel was very nice and great location! Staff was very friendly and accommodating. Request a corner room on a higher floor. Lots of windows and great views of the city. Walking distance to Navy Pier, Lou Malnati's pizza, and great shopping everywhere. Taxi to O'Hare was about $40. You can take the train, but it's about a 4 block walk from the train station to the Omni. Rooms were a little on the small side, but we didn't spend a lot of time in the room so it was fine. Sirens are sounding frequently, but that was expected in downtown Chicago. I would stay at this hotel again!"
"Vacationing in Chicago and stayed at the Omni Hotel. The service at this hotel was excellent for us. The front desk staff was extremely courteous and helpful. Checking in only took a matter of minutes. Our room was comfortable and quiet. The front door staff was awesome!!! They were so friendly and always willing to help us with recommendations or directions. Whenever we return to Chicago, we will definitely stay at the Omni again! Thanks for helping to make our vacation a great one!!"
"There is nothing wrong with this place and I enjoyed my stay there. It just seems like for every one thing the place has going for it there is another thing that holds it back. The one exception is probably that it has an excellent location. The rooms are big, which is nice, but they are also dated. The place is clean, but it also lacks any sort of ambiance. You have to take an elevator to the lobby and then you also have to take another elevator to the floor with the bar or to your room. It makes it so that the place really doesn't have an energy to it. It's kind of like being at an airport gate with a check in desk. I wouldn't discourage anyone from staying there but I also wouldn't recommend it. The staff was fine, but that's about it. Nobody was over the top nice or went out of their way, but at the same time nobody was rude or anything. Just dull and dated. They should shell out $20/hour to get a piano player in the lobby and maybe set up a small bar or something to breath some life into the place. It was just kind of like a boring date, where afterwards you think the person was fine and nice and you can't say anything too bad about them but you don't have any burning desire to go out with them again either."
"we stayed for one night in july. we were there for a trade show at the merchandise mart..the location is great! right off Michigan Ave and only a 6 or so block walk to the mart. my room was lovely. although the bathroom was a little disappointing..I expected a nicer tub/shower area, although this is not a deal breaker. I did have a problem with the shower and the front desk had someone at my room in 5 minutes!! and he fixed it immediately!! like mentioned in other reviews, the double elevator thing is a little annoying. it is a little pricey, the location and the service justify the price."
"This is now the third Omni hotel in which I've stayed and this was the best. I had a mini suite, with bedroom, bathroom, and lounge area. It was well equipped with a sink in the lounge area, tea/coffee facilities. Despite being beside the service elevator, I couldn't hear anything from it. Two minor areas of irritation. The lift system would be much better if you Could go straight to your floor, rather than going to floor three or four and then changing elevator. Secondly, the mini bar prices are VERY misleading. I had a snickers, advertised as$3 but in the bill it came to more than $5 when tax and restocking fee were added. I realise there is probably a note buried somewhere about the restocking price but it seems very expensive."
"Stayed in a corner suite with our family of four (2 girls ages 2&4) over July 4th and we loved it. Very family friendly (kids got activity backpacks when we arrived), great kids menu, rooms with bedroom doors that shut and a location close to lots of attractions. It's not super luxurious but nice and when they forgot to clean our room (after 3 phone call reminder / requests) they gave us a generous food credit for the trouble. I would look for other Onmi's for future travel."
"We stayed one night for a concert at Wrigley Field. The location is excellent. Right off of Michigan Avenue. We chose a king suite which was marginal at best. The room is tired. The carpet was buckled as was the wallpaper. There was a flat screen in the outer room but an old small set in the bedroom. The bath was ok. For the price we were expecting something a lot nicer. However, all of the staff went above and beyond. Torrence at the front desk was especially patient."
"The Omni is in an excellent location on Michigan, convenient to nearly everything in downtown Chicago. As others have noted, the rooms are starting to appear somewhat dated compared to all of the new and updated hotels in Chicago. That said, our room was very clean and comfortable. I found that the pictures on Omni's website accurately represented our room - more of a plush luxury style than many of the newer hotels' modern/minimalist style. We experienced service that was second to none. The staff was very welcoming and seemed genuinely friendly. I wouldn't hesitate to stay at the Omni the next time I am in Chicago."
"I was quite pleased with this Omni property, right in the heart of Chicago on the fabulous Magnificent Mile. For an excellent nightly rate of $198 we received a mini suite with living room, bar area, desk and separate bedroom. An incredible value for Memorial Day weekend. The pool/spa area was well appointed and maintained nicely. We found the hotel staff to be very friendly and helpful, and the housekeeping staff superior. The front door/bell staff was always there to help and greeted you with a hello/smile every time you came though the door. Special kudos to Concierge Staff Marcus and Melissa for making our dinner reservations and working out our weekend logistics, they were super!! The only real area for improvement would be the on-site restaurant, we found it under-whelming. Excellent value, nice property, you won't be disappointed with this superior lodging option in a perfect location - great value with superior quality.Restaurant Recommendations:Hugo's Frog House/Gibsons Steakhouse - a Chicago classic steak and seafood house with traditional white coat service. A definite ""old school"" treat, a Chicago institution.The Webber Grille - yes, that's right, the Webber Grille in the garage, they have their own restaurant. Grille fare is outstanding, definitely can taste the grilled goodness, cool place to check out for sure.Table Fifty Two - Run by Oprah's former personal chef (see my separate recommendation), just go there, you will love it, one of the best meals I have ever eaten out!!!!!!!!!!!David Burke's Prime Steakhouse - A prime steak house with some Asian flare to it, meal was delicious, start to finish and it is highly recommended."
"Stayed here May 9th weekend. Pros: Location is the best on Michigan avenue. The hotel is centrally located to everything. Check in was easy and great. The rooms are very spacious. The bathroom is also very nice with a large sink area. Cons: Instead of 2 small uncomfortable chairs in the room, it would be more functional if the rooms had a sofa. The carpet is also old and worn. The mattress was much too soft and I woke up with a achy back. The TV's are old, especially the one in the bedroom. It is a small CRT TV; not a flat screen. Even the living room TV although a flat screen needs to be updated. Overall hotel was great and I think with just a few updates to the rooms this hotel will be fantastic. Will definitely stay there again!


Room Tip: Choose a high floor facing Lake Michigan and the shops

"Excellent hotel, great location, staff was very attentive, rooms were immaculate, food was great, we will definitely stay here again. Location was within walking distance of many great restaurants and shopping locations. We arrived early and our room was ready, we were given a late checkout time which really helped. It was my wife's birthday, the hotel sent us a great dessert and bottle of wine, complimentary. Everything was excellent."
"This hotel is all about location: a walking distance to all the major sites and attractions, access to public transport is extremely easy, main shopping street is under your windows. Moreover, room rates are quite affordable, especially taking into consideration the fact that the smallest room you could get is a suite. The only possible drawback is these rooms are dated, but the hotel is going to renovate in the nearest future, and probably it becomes a hidden gem of Michigan Avenue. Am check out their restaurant. Selections of cheeses and charcuterie meats is the best!"

"The Omni was a marvelous experience. We have had many good experiences in the downtown Chicago areabut this was the best in terms of offering a professional and friendly staff, incredibly convenient location (especially if you are having trouble with an Apple product), lovely, spacious rooms where one can read after midnight without disturbing the others, excellent products, and other conveniences such as as abundance of electrical outlets in which to plug the many devices with which we must travel at this point. We were able to secure a wonderful price; we actually could hardly believe our good fortune."
"The entire staff at the Omni in Chicago was friendly and accommodating. We were tight on time to get to a college open house. The valet listened to our directions and grabbed us a cab. This wonderful valet set the tone for the rest of our very positive experience at the Omni. We made it to our appointment on time. When we returned we were delighted that our belongings were in our room exactly as we had asked. The room was spacious and had a wonderful view of the lake and the city. The room was clean and welcoming. Loved the doors closing off the bedroom area.The view off the pool area was breathtaking. We had breakfast in the morning, and the staff was courteous and took care of all our needs. The views from the restaurant were amazing. We have visited Chicago many times and this is by far the best experience we have had. The Omni will be our first and only choice on future trips to Chicago."
"I had high expectations for Omni. I found cat feces in the room before checking out. The concierge at the front desk offered breakfast as compensation. After finding Feces, I will not be eating their food, and I will not be staying here again. I paid $300 for a suite to find feces. I wonder what the health department will think when I send them the pictures. I will not return to Omni. The Bar staff is boring, and does not care about their guests. We told the bartender It was my girlfriends 21st birthday, she didn't even get a happy birthday, and then we had to pull teeth from the bartender for her to even help us decide on a drink. I will not return to the Omni again. Do not book with the Omni if you expect any regular amenities that you would get from a Hotel that is not as ""Luxurious"" as the Omni. I've attached the photos of the Feces I found in the room. I would like to add that this is not listed as a pet friendly hotel and I expected a little more cleanliness and class when paying so much for a room.

"Another great experience staying at this wonderful all-suite hotel ideally located on Michigan Avenue. We chose the special package ""Shop the Mag Mile"" and for the extra money received great value - a $30 dining voucher per adult per day in hotel restaurant, shopping coupons and area map per stay, a $25 Visa gift card per day, and an Omni tote bag...wonderful value. All aspects of the stay were excellent.


Room Tip: I doubt if any suites (remember it's an all-suite hotel) are less than good, but a corner suite...

All the staff were very friendly and helpful. We got a Travellzoo deal that included $30 per day food and beverage voucher. Overall, very happy with our stay here!!


Room Tip: We had high floor so no issue with noise.

"Omni all suite hotel is well-located and well-priced. I did not need a suite, but the cost was comparable to other hotels in Chicago where I've stayed before, including the Intercontinental and the Knickerbocker. The key attribute is Service. The front desk had all my paperwork ready when I walked in the door. When I got to my room I found that the freight/employee elevator was audible from my room and I requested a change. Within 10 minutes I was whisked away to a new room, and got help with my bag. Checkout was automatic. No need to do anything. I just joined their Special Guest Program and got free wifi and free coffee delivered to my room. Perfect. I will be back!"
"We are just finishing a three night stay. We have really enjoyed the Omni. The suite was spacious with a large bathroom accessible from both the living and bedrooms. The living area has a wet bar, desk, two chairs and flat screen TV. Our bedroom had a super comfortable king bed with nice sheets and comforter. There is a nice size closet and built-in dresser as well as two night stands. Our stay was super quiet. We were on the 24th floor and looked out over Huron St. and had a nice partial view of Lake Michigan. There are wonderful restaurants within walking distance and the Miracle Mile is right outside the front door. The bathroom is marble and quite spacious. Tere was a great shower with curved shower curtain. The amenities were high quality. We only ate at the hotel for breakfast because we had a $30 credit each day. The buffet contains top quality items and has an omelet station. They also make fresh pancakes and waffles. Ask fro a high floor for the view and also a quiet location."
"Great location. The all suite provided plenty of space. Hotel staff wonderful and helpful. Our corner room was dated, drafty and loud. Hospitals nearby, ambulance and honking at night. Restaurants and shopping nearby. We were able to walk to the subway, The Sears Tower, now known as the Willis Tower, The Navy Pier and Millennium Park. The Concierge recommended Absolute Segway, an awesome experience."
"The Omni is a great location to walk Chicago. Close to lots of shopping and dining and easy walk to Navy Pier. The accomodations were very clean and updated. Nice suite with seperate bedroom. Bathroom entrance from sitting area and bedroom both. Nice touch is windows that open to let in the fresh air. Employees were all very pleasant and accomodating.


Room Tip: We stayed on the 7th floor but higher up would probably be better. Chicago is a bit noisy.

The Omni Hotels and Resorts have proven to me on multiple times that it represents excellence personified. Very professional and friendly staff!!! I have stayed at the Omni multiple times and I will always want to come back because it's always an awesome experience for me and my family and I've had business meetings at the Omni as well I highly recommend families and business professionals stay there and conduct business there!!!
"We have a 2 young children that we decided to take the Chicago for a few days. The Omni made what could have been a very stressful trip, very easy. We were very impressed with the valet, front door and bell hop assistance. The room was very clean and quite. The pool was small, but very clean and perfect for our needs. We did the parking package and were very pleased with the services. The hotel is perfectly located in the middle of everything. We only took our car out one time to visit the Museum Campus. We will definitely be returning to the Omni with our family."
"The Omni Chicago is located in the heart of the shopping and restaurants! I didn't spend a lot of time in the hotel, but I can say that it was clean, spacious, and the staff was friendly. This was my first time in Chicago, so there was so much that I wanted to see. This is my boyfriend's neck of the woods, and everything that he wanted to show me was in walking distance from the hotel! Anyone who is looking for a nice place to stay in Chicago, this location is PRIME!"
"My experience at the Omni was very pleasant. Excellent location, close to business appointments, friendly staff, quiet room/suite, everything you need for a good stay. Very close to the Lakeshore, Mag Mile, shopping, restaurants (& had an EXCELLENT massage at Urban Oasis only blocks away, by Terry). Couple of blocks down from Whole Foods & you could request a frig in your suite. I would recommend & would definitely stay here again."
"We stayed at the Omni for a spring break to Chicago. The location was perfect. We got a suite for the 4 of us. The pool was nice and the exercise room had cold water, cold towels, and ear phones for the tvs. Wonderful. The housekeeping, conceraige, and front desk staff were awesome! We loved out experience. The girls loved the cookies and milk at bedtime too. Would stay again in a heart beat!

"I have to admit that when I first walked into the building, the small area that I thought was the lobby had me skeptical. HOWEVER I soon realized that due to the cramped downtown area, the lobby was actually on the 6th floor, and extremely clean and welcoming. The staff and manager were professional and very friendly. The suite was very roomy and comfortable. I wished that I had stumbled upon this place earlier so we could spend the whole weekend there! Truly felt like a vacation...even though I'm a Chicago resident."
"This is a very good location.....just across from Nordstrom's and other shopping as well as close to many good restaurants. Beds are comfortable and it is nice to have a small kitchen area especially when staying for several nights. Rooms and furniture are getting a bit tired. My experience with the staff was less than great, unfortunately. I was surprised when a custodial employee entered my room without knocking to tell me that my credit card was declined and my keys didn't work anymore. No calls, no knock on the door? The front desk staff assumed that my credit card had been declined, when in fact their system went down and lost my information. The manager of the hotel promised to investigate, but never got back to me. This type of service is why the hotel is average at best!However, Amer and his staff at the valet are top notch!"
"First the good things. The location is good within walking distance of city center offices. Rooms are nice.There is a gym with a nice view on the 19th Floor. And the breakfast is fine. Nice valet service at the reception. Not so good: Passages look kind of old and dingy. Bad : I got charged for 3 days more than 1 stayed. I called up 3 times. No one has replied as yet. I am disappointed by this service especially because thus far, I have always liked staying at Homewoods properties."
"I've been coming down to Chicago with my family for the past 8 years and this is the first year we decided to stay the night and make it a two day event. I'm glad I booked at this hotel! Very accomodating and the rooms are spacious, clean and the front desk is very curteous! We were able to stop in early and drop our bags off so we didn't have to carry them around Chicago the whole day while we waited for our rooms to get ready. That was above and beyond of what we expected. One of the rooms needed a baby crib and that was brought up as soon as we got checked into our room. Beds were super comfy! Fluffy pillows and not to mention a really great breakfast the next morning! If you want to have a little getaway in downtown Chicago, then I would gladly recommend this hotel for you. We will definitely be back next year or even this summer for a little trip! Thank you for the hospitality! :-)"
"From the beginning our stay here was very good. ""Sal"", the leader of the valet crew, was so personable and friendly. He introduced himself and called me by name on each interaction. The staff was pleasant. The wifi was a little suspect at times. The ""pent house"" pool was unbelievable. It was truly like swimming with the skyscrapers. The hotel is perfectly situated just a couple blocks from the Magnificent Mile with other shopping and restaurants within blocks. Definitely recommend this hotel. If you're bringing a car make sure and get the Parking special!

"We stayed 3 nights in a 1BR suite on the 12th floor. Got an amazing deal at $120/night which included parking with in/out, so I really wasn't expecting all that much... But everything was great - location was awesome, valets were attentive and prompt, front desk was personable and efficient, online check in was slick, breakfast was plentiful and tasty. Having a full kitchen was nice; we had dinner delivered one night, so it was great to have real dishes, glasses, cutlery, etc. We would totally stay here again!"
"Location is perfect, Old Traditional style hotel with beautiful interior decoration, excellent restaurant, cafes and all other facilities. Staff is friendly and helpful. Breakfast (included for the guests of executive floors) is very good. Rooms are very clean and stuffed with good quality amenities.
I would recommend this hotel for business and casual visitors of Chicago. and, by the way,...

Went on a business trip and stayed here for a little over a week. The room location was great with a view of the Lake and a 2 minute walk to Michigan Ave. Room was comfortable and clean. Hotel is quite large and there are a lot of amenities it has to offer. I normally prefer a smaller quieter hotel in the area. That is my only real disappointment is that it is too busy for me. Restaurant serves good food at hotel prices.
"I searched and searched and searched for a hotel in Chicago having never been. I came upon this hotel by accident as I was researching. I was very surprised and pleased with the value of the hotel. I had no idea what I had found until I arrived. The location is absolutely perfect with so many great things to do within walking distance. Another great surprise was the delicious complementary breakfast. This is not a Holiday Inn breakfast mind you. This is a full hot breakfast buffet. What really sold me on this hotel was the availability of having this suite. In the outer area, the sitting area, my son could stay up and watch TV late and I could go into the other room close the doors and go to bed early if I needed. This was a great set up for our family. I highly recommend this hotel and the next time I come back to Chicago, this is where I'll stay."
"My sister and I stay 3 nights annually to shop and enjoy the city. Awesome location across from Shops at North Bridge. It is surrounded by Eatily, Joe's, Shake Shack, and numerous shops and restaurants. We've never used the valet service, but the doormen are helpful, pleasant and knowledgeable about nearby offerings. The rooms are large and fully stocked; just a call to the front desk has always gotten us quick service with anything extra we need. The beds are SO comfortable! The bedding/bath towels look fresh and new. The housekeeping staff keep the rooms and common areas free of debris and are readily available. We have moved the dates of our annual trip to include more weekdays to take advantage of the complementary dinner. As another reviewer stated, the selection is pre-determined, but I've never been disappointed with the quantity or quality of the items I've eaten. (Certainly, it's a savings of well over $50 for my sister and I to use for shopping instead of eating!) Breakfast is also good to start our day. 4 stars instead of 5 are due to a couple of things: the pool needs a little more regular attention (floating debris the last time we tried swimming), the WiFi is spotty at best, and the rooms, while large enough, are in need of some updating. Carpet & kitchen cabinetry show signs of wear. Some re-grouting wouldn't hurt in the bathrooms, too. Thank you for a dependable place to call home when in Chicago!!"
"We stayed here Thanksgiving weekend to celebrate our 15 yrs together..We were surprised to find a nice bottle of wine, along with a nice note in the room on arrival. We were very impressed.. We found the staff helpful and pleasant.. Check-in was efficient. The rooms were spacious and very clean.. The bedding was extremely comfortable... Breakfast was crowded but with lots of choices. This property is in an excellent location for taking on Chicago by foot or public transportation. We would definitely stay here again.

"Stayed here after a great stay at the Homewood Suites in Harrisburg.We took the Subway / L from Midway Airport so we didn't need to pay for parking.I was happy with my week long stay but there are few issues that we came across. Breakfast & Dinner were busy and at one point there was a wait. We adjusted our routine so that we came early to avoid the busy times. Elevator was also slow and busy every time we went to use it. Everything else was great. The bed & room was great size, WIFI was adequate, all the staff we spoke to were nice. Breakfast & Dinner had a nice varity."
"We stayed here this week and I must say, spend a little more and stay at the Embassy Suites. The rooms are much larger for more than two people.

"The first impression at the ground Floor is somewhat mixed, as you have to take the lift to the 6 Th Floor for the reception. However the personel is very helpfull and the Suites are big with 2 Panasonic flatscreens, a full kitchen and place to work and relax.In the morning there is a free breakfast with varying composition of good quality and fresh ingredients. And there is a good strong coffee, quite exceptional in the US.The rooms are quiet and clean . At the reception drinks and even Bread can be bought, nice service when you are on business in a big city.On one evening I used the free dinner service with free drinks, even beer , and this appeared also of good quality and just what you need on a cold november night in Chicago.

But the front desk is terrible. The space of the breakfast is also small for the size of the hotel.Next year I will come back but this hotel lost my group."
"The Homewood Suites is the place to stay if you are traveling as a family. They offer a full breakfast and dinner many nights. The meals are included for up to 4 in a room. The suites are small, a bit run down, but very comfortable. The staff couldn't be nicer. The location is very convenient to Michigan Avenue, walking to the river and lake and public transportation. The breakfasts were very good, offering lots of choices including hot and cold meal choices. However, due to the large number of families with kids there was a wait, or you had to bring food back to your room. The hotel is very quiet. My husband and I stayed at the Homewood Suites over Thanksgiving which might explain how crowded it was. If you are traveling as a couple, you might consider a different hotel that is a little less hectic, especially during holidays or school vacations.


Room Tip: Ask for a corner room on a higher floor away from the elevator.

"We stayed here recently for. Family Thanksgiving trip. Overall we were happy with the service and rooms. The rooms were definitely no frills, not as nice as some other extended stays that we have stayed at in Chicago, but the location is great. One issue that could be a deal breaker, though, was the breakfast and dinner service. The lines were horrible, which can be hard to deal with when small children are involved. We continued to have this problem no matter what time we tried to eat. Most of the time there was no place to sit and most food items were empty. Still up on the air as to whether we would stay again, as the good piece is very important to us with small children. With that being said, it was a holiday weekend and very busy."
"Two of my grandchildren and I stayed here the weekend following Thanksgiving and it was a truly wonderful experience! Starting with the valet staff at street level to the reception desk to the management to the staff in the eating area, we were always greeted with friendly smiles and kindness. My youngest grandson enjoyed the fact that he shared his name (Alex) with Alejandro at the front desk and the manager (Marcus) gave the kids free snacks when we were rooting around in the snack room. My grandson lost his brand new sunglasses just before we left and Selena helped us locate them in the breakfast room. There are just not enough words to say how wonderful the staff is at this hotel.The hotel itself is in a marvelous location downtown and we were greeted by a welcome fire in the fireplace at check-in. The elevators are a bit slow, but I believe the hotel was probably very crowded as evidenced by the number of people at breakfast. The breakfast selection is enormous by the standards of normal hotel free breakfasts. Eggs, sausage, biscuits, gravy, waffles, cereal, fruit, juices, hot oatmeal, toast on the first day with pancakes instead of waffles on the second day. The rooms aren't very large, but it was plenty of room for the 3 of us! I loved having a kitchen so we could make popcorn or mini pizzas without having to go out and brave the crowds in the restaurants. The rooms have a full-size refrigerator. The kids loved the pool area and the fitness room next door looked well stocked with equipment.This is a place I would stay again and again.


Room Tip: We were far from the elevators and it was nice and quiet.

"I have to begin by mentioning the very friendly, attentive staff. This is a very family-oriented hotel. The breakfasts were crowded with lots of kids. The suites are pretty small and filled with furniture. I'd prefer one big room over three small rooms - very little open space. The location is very convenient to the Miracle Mile and lots of great restaurants. We were traveling as a couple and I would not recommend staying here as a couple - spend a few more bucks on the Hampton Inn or Embassy Suites. But it's a great spot for young families."
Like so many have mentioned the location is great close proximity to shopping and dining tourist attractions if you're interested in that. The rooms were clean and well appointed they had a good breakfast. it's your basic Homewood Suites we're not talking about a five star hotel here but I have to say it felt like more than just a Homewood Suites and I think a lot of that has to do with their staff they were all extremely friendly they really put in effort to make my stay as comfortable as possible.
"Although it was only a 1 night flight thru O'hare, I chose this property because of it's high rating vs. the airport hotels didn't have the same. I wasn't disappointed. It's a good 35 minute commute from airport to the hotel, but as the property is not in the heart of downtown. traffic is a bit less.The lobby is on a higher floor, not the first, and valet parking is mandatory + pricey (over 55$ a day) , but that is Chicago downtown for you. The staff are very friendly and I was upgraded in accord with my Diamond Status.The room was older but very comfortable. It had a living room and bedroom, both very clean but a tad small. The bed was comfortable and I slept well that night.The bathroom had a tub shower and stingy water pressure due to the high floor and those frustrating water conservation shower heads. Some day hotels will measure how much extra water people use to compensate for the reduced water of the ""green"" devices and chuck them. Upon check out the next morning, too early sadly, the staff were also very polite and offered no surprises on the bill.I recommend this property and would gladly stay there the next time I am in Chicago.

"There was a fire in our home, and we needed a place to stay FAST. We booked Homewood Suites Downtown Chicago at 40 E. Grand Close to my office, and they allow dogs! The staff booking over the phone was easy and quick, and they were most empathetic. Everything was made easy, from arrival through arranging a late check out this afternoon. Amer and the rest of the door staff were always prompt in getting my car, handling luggage and boxes as we attempted to rescue stuff from our apartment each day; and they took a real liking to our 17 year old golden retriever. :-)Lorena and the rest of the front desk staff were helpful and kind; as were the housekeeping and maintenance staff who took great care of us.Breakfast included each morning was hot and tasty.We are very grateful to have landed here in our moment of tragedy. These people know the meaning of hospitality!"
"Stayed at the Homewood Suites last weekend and very much enjoy our visit and stay at the hotel is in a great location. Hotel is a few blocks off Miracle Mile but yet near Macys and may and many stores and restaurants. Hotel is easy one mile or less walk from the South Shore train that we took to Chicago from Michigan City, IN. Breakfast was good with more selections than your cheaper chain hotels. We heard almost nothing at night while in our room so the walls are pretty thick and sound proof. Only reason I did not give it a 5 rating was because our room was a corner room and was very small. I looked at other rooms and they were bigger. Avoid room 1505 or corner rooms. Very please with our stay and would stay again. Nice job Homewood.


Room Tip: Avoid corner rooms, smaller than others

"Honestly, we chose this hotel because it was a little cheaper, and offered free breakfast. We were VERY satisfied. The bell station staff were courteous, helpful and very attentive. Breakfast had a good variety and staff were attentive to keeping tables clean. Room was very clean and we were happy with accommodations. We would recommend this hotel, and would choose Homewood again because of the service and value that we received."
"The location can't be beat, shares a building with Eataly, half a block from the red line, excellent neighborhood. The suites are smaller and more run down than the Hampton suites down the street. Our room had a broken kitchen cabinet, sheets that barely covered the mattress, and the bedroom didn't have space for our luggage. Overall it was a tolerable stay but wish we had booked at the Hampton for similar rate but better hotel."
"Stayed here as was in town for a conference. This location gave me a better rate than the conference hotel, which was right next door. Arrived early and the room was ready. (Photos of room 1103 submitted.) While the furniture was a bit worn, the bed was comfortable and it was nice to have a separate living area from the bedroom. Housekeeping did a good job daily. The complimentary breakfasts were good, although the area was consistently busy. Did not try the complimentary dinners. Visited the pool to see it. It looked inviting. No whirlpool/hot tub. Overall, a good value for the money and a great location (near Magnificent Mile)!"
"We booked this hotel because it was a great location and amazing deal for a large suite - which is always high on our wish list when traveling with our 3 kids ages 2, 4 & 5. But, despite the value, I would not recommend this place to anyone. The entire hotel is serviced by two small elevators, and the main lobby/dining room is several floors up, so the elevators get a LOT of use. I honestly can't quite believe that the system is up to code, with so many demands on so few lifts. The TINY street level anteroom is always unbelievably crowded with people waiting for cars and cabs and elevators, it is extremely ungracious. There is a TON of ""free"" food - but it's REALLY bad. Really, really bad. But apparently people like it because the dining room is very crowded, and it's impossible to get a table during peak breakfast hours. Anyway - the location is nice and convenient, and it's definitely a low cost option. But, despite the low price, I wouldn't say it's a good value - it's a very cheap experience."
"This hotel was in a great location, across from high end shops and within walking distance or a short cab ride to many of Chicago's landmark attractions: Navy Pier, Millennium Park. It was easy to get to from the Red Line, so we walked or utilized public transit. The amenities were valuable. We took advantage of the weeknight manager's dinner and daily breakfast buffet. The staff was friendly. Hotel rooms are on the 7th floor and above, which lessens the city noise, and offers skyscraper views. The rooms have the traditional spacious layout, including kitchenette, but finishes are older."
"After canceling a reservation prior to the cut off date (3 days prior to stay) and told that there would be no charge for the room, we were billed on our credit card the full price of the room. We even changed our location to another Hilton hotel for the same nights a few blocks away. When we informed them they said we never cancelled. When we talked to Hilton guest services, they confirmed that it was cancelled, but could do nothing about the charge - that needed to be handled by the site management. We have been trying to contact the site for 3+ weeks and have not heard from them. AVOID THIS HOTEL IF YOU STAY IN CHICAGO! Terrible customer service and criminal behavior is the norm!

"Little worn and dated interior, but comfy bed, and AMAZING Views of the downtown, Wrigley Building, Trump Tower. THREE big windows in the corner king suite of this building. From a person who is not from the city, this was a real treat, the views we had. Pretty quiet and no issues with it other than that the morning of the marathon, there was a strange noise that started around 8:30am. Very loud, like a plumbing or HVAC noise, don't know. We left right after that. If I had been sleeping in, I would've been mad, but we left, so I didn't care anymore. The location was great for the marathon, went right past the building. Included breakfast, hot, but nothing to write home about. I ate it anyway because I am always hungry :) Also, even with only having my mom and I on the trip, it is really nice to have the two room thing, so worth it! fridge, sink, separate room for tv or looking at city, etc. Location very very convenient. If you have money to spend, Joe's seafood/steak place on the corner, excellent! Also, I guess they have dinners during the week. we weren't there then so I can't vouch for it, but nice to have it offered.

"It was a nice hotel in a place where you want to be located. Like a tiny 1 bedroom with a small full kitchen, large bathroom that's separated (sink outside the door). The furnishings were out of the 70s and both loveseat and chair were uncomfortable in the living room. Hard to bend around to see the TV, but being near everything it was nice to have a kitchen with tiny dining table. Lobby is on the 6th floor and the service is lacking. Not that bad, just not there."
"The location is perfect, in the heart of the city at walking distance from all the good stuff that Chicago offers.The room has good space, it is like an one bedroom apartment with a little kitchen and a living room.The windows are sound proof, you can't hear anything from the streets.The only reason for the four stars instead of five was the shower. The water doesn't come with much pressure, but I could live with that."

"The staff members were extremely nice! The beds were comfortable, however, the pull out sofa wasn't acceptable. The sofa and chair were very old, dirty, and uncomfortable. The carpet was actually damp in some places and had a mildew smell. The hot breakfast was excellent but on the weekends, I feel like a 7:00 am start time is too late; 6:00 am would be more appropriate. The location is great but I don't plan on staying at this property again while in Chicago."
"Yes, the rugs are scuffed, but for this business traveler who likes to do her own real cooking, it was awesome. Full refrigerator, knives that cut, stovetop, plates, bowls, even a couple of microwave cooking dishes. One block from a Trader Joes and less from Eataly. The atmosphere in the elevator/dining room/halls was like family camp, kids running everywhere, the staff very helpful. The rooms completely quiet, the views out the window of the neighboring skyscrapers uplifting. Neighborhood is in central downtown near Michigan Ave shopping strip, but it doesn't feel noisy or oppressive. Lovely to have a separate bedroom and a decent-sized living room and kitchen too. Business ctr. for printing out boarding passes. Could have used a desk, but can't have everything. Check in is on the 6th floor. I passed on the meals, they looked like camp food. Not glamorous, but a nice place to hang and met my needs perfectly. Check out the Millennium Park at the Art Institute while you're there. I used Uber to get around and loved it."
"Came into town for a short stay (three nights) but the kitchen came in handy. Traveling with four kids (under 10) can have it's challenges but the pool and ""roomy"" room made it that much easier. The staff were Wonderful. Sal was a great asset. He always made sure we were pointed in the right direction, was a wealth of knowledge and made our family feel welcome. We all enjoyed a plentyful breakfast before heading out for the day. The location was perfect. Lots of great shopping and dining within walking distance. The train was near by as well. Wouldn't think of staying anywhere else."
"The hotel is clean and in the heart of downtown....close to everything. They offer a complimentary breakfast which was below average. They had a waffle bar which was awesome, but the eggs, sausage, potatoes, and other options were subpar. I was also disappointed they didn't offer complimentary wi-fi...or at the very least ethernet ports in the rooms. I consider that a must in this day and age. The staff were extremely friendly and helpful."
"Seriously. I LOVE that the bedroom is separate from the living/sitting room (TVs in each, what a nice amenity). Wonderful king size bed. Fully equipped kitchen including dishwasher. BIG living space. Good free breakfast; excellent service, especially the valet car service. Within walking distance of Art Institute, The Egg, Millenium Park, the Magnificent Mile--truly outstanding experience, especially for the price."

They were always smiling, cheerful and willing to help. I will definitely stay here next time we travel to Chicago and look for other Homewood Suites to stay at in other cities. Their complementary breakfast (Mon-Thurs) was a real breakfast (eggs, meat, toast, bagels, cereal, potatoes, etc.) served as a buffet. They also offer complementary dinner Mon-Thurs, which we were unable to attend. If you are looking for a good restaurant I highly recommend Joe's, right next to the hotel."
"We recently stayed at this hotel and found the location and amenities to be fantastic! Here are a few pros and cons from our visit:Pros-Location, location, location! (right off Michigan Ave in the heart of the city)Room size for family of 3Hot breakfast included (saved some money here)Views from upper floors are lovelyCons-Internet times out every 10 minutes (very frustrating when watching Netflix)TV lost reception on channels periodically (particularly in the upper channels)Parking is valet only and $55 a day (we found cheaper self-parking within a block)Overall, the stay was enjoyable and we will likely rebook at this location in the future.

"Stayed here with my husband and two kids (age 9,7). This hotel was perfect. It was easy to get to by L or bus. Free hot breakfast was actually really good. There was a full kitchen and a grocery store just a few blocks away. The rooms are very nice, comfortable and clean. The indoor pool on the upper floor is surrounded by windows with views of downtown. Price was good too. We'll definitely stay here again."
"I just love this hotel and I keep coming back here every time I come back to Chicago. This hotel represents my kind of town Chicago, great hospitality, friendly staff, and pleasant time. I have never had any unpleasant moment at this hotel. I just have to emphasize that all the hotel staff there are just great, friendly, and helpful, especially Marcus! You are an amazing manager and helped me through the unfortunate accident and made this time stay greater than it can be. It is the people who make your stay more than perfect and give you such wonderful time. I do not own the address in Chicago anymore but this hotel is my home in Chicago. I am sure that you will love the hotel when you once stay there."
This hotel is the best value in Chicago. They were attentive and helpful and you couldn't ask for a better rate in such a fantastic location. We had a sick infant while there and didn't want to go out into the sub zero Chicago weather when he had a fever. We used their grocery service and they brought us back diapers and infant tylenol for no additional up charge. It was a great service and much appreciated! I will definitely stay there again.

"Excellent location, excellent rooms and the most fantastic staff I have ever come across on our holidays to USA. They were exceptional. The breakfasts were are a good start to the day and the pool on the 19th floor was great for either an early morning or late evening swim. It was always empty during our stay Oct/Nov.

"This was my first time staying at this hotel. I loved the location - close to shopping, a choice of restaurants, and even a movie theater - and the staff was great. I had a room on the top floor (19th) and enjoyed the view. The exercise room was also on the top floor and offered a great view of the city while working out. There was also a pool which I'll need to take advantage of next time I stay there. My room was very clean and had a lot of nice amenities in the kitchen. I liked the abundance of plugs for my computer and chargers. The bed was really comfy. I had a little surprise one morning with a window cleaner dangling outside, but that's why you keep your curtains closed! I'm definitely staying here again.

"This hotel is centrally located, just a block off the magnificent mile and a block from the Grand red line stop. You can get anywhere very quickly. The rooms are suites with a kitchen, bedroom and living room. The kitchen which makes it nice for leftovers from the many area restaurants you will want to try. There is a nice breakfast everyday with make your own waffles (this area can sometimes be chaotic with rookie waffle makers!), pastries, bagels. yogurt, fresh fruit, scrambled eggs, a breakfast meat that changes and a potato that changes. They also serve dinner and drinks during the week. It was also nice to have coffee and tea always available in the lobby. It was a cold week and this was a nice stop on the way up to the room. The staff is very nice and really seem to care that you enjoy your stay. There is a nice but small pool on the 19th floor, stocked with towels. It is a great view while swimming. This is one of our favorite places to stay in Chicago for the location, extra touches and value."
"We have started staying at homewood suites with our two kids (9 & 11) because the suites give us plenty of room. This location & hotel were awesome mostly because of the service! From the valet to the front desk to the housekeeping to the breakfast, everyone was so accommodating and kind. Amer and the valet team were great and the front desk found me a phone charger and charged my phone when I needed it. They had dvds and games for the kids and my son loved the 24 hour hot cocoa too :) Great location!"

From the minute we checked in with Starr at the front desk, to our first breakfast with Connie offering a warm smile, it made a bad circumstance better.

Very good complimentary hot supper (Mon. thru Thurs.)

"Our first visit to Chicago downtown. Driving into the location from the west seemed a little convoluted and busy as we are from a small town in Iowa and not use to the hustle and bustle of a big city. Even though, once in downtown, the hotel was easy to find, and with valet service, our vehicle drop off was was quick and convenient. Our stay was for two nights. Check-in was located on the 6th floor away from the small entry way into the hotel on the ground floor. Staff was exremely helpful, polite and conversational during our stay. We were able to walk to areas around the hotel to various convenience stores, bars and restuarants. Streets were crowded and seemed safe enough during normal daytime and evening hours. We attended a Chicago Cubs game on the second day, and took the ""red line"" train to Wrigley from about two blocks away from our hotel....very convenient and inexpensive. The ride was not unduly long. Enjoyed the comp breakfast each morning, although it was extremely busy and required a short wait the first day. The meal was OK, but could have been much better with a higher quality and variety of meat product (link sausage both day). Prices of the room seemed high, but probably because we are not use to spending about $250 per night. That did include a valet parking charge of $42 per night which I understood was competitive for the downtown area. Check-out was a breeze, and with our GPS system, getting on track to the route back home was relatively easy.

We like to stay downtown so we can walk to just about everything, and we like to stay places that apprecaite customer service.We hit the jackpot this time.What was supposed to be a weekend birthday get away turned into a reunion of friends and family, and thanks to Daniel of Homewood Suites, the event went off like a charm.As far as the hotel, it's in a super location...the only place you would need to get transportaton to visit would be Wrigley Field or the Museum of Science and Industry....everything else you can (and should) walk to from here. Also, the rooms are suites, so they are spacious and comfortable. The entire Property is very clean and well maintained. All the staff throughout our 3 night stay were awesome....from the bell staff, to the desk, to the cleaning staff. Everyone was friendly...and everyone was good at their roles. I've stayed at 6 or 7 other properities in the area through the years, and no one has ever taken as good of care of us as the people here. Thanks Daniel et al for a memorable stay.

"The location of this hotel is wonderful. Close to all the major attractions. A very walkable city with friendly people overall. We were greeted upon arrival, our bags were taken and our car parked. The staff (especially Amer and Noah and Connie) are fabulous. I had read about Amer on this site so I asked for him. He was not there at the time but the next morning he greeted with such a friendly smile and suggestions for our day. Whoever trains this staff has done a great job. Connie runs the dining room in the morning in that same friendly professional way. We always choose Hilton properties for our travel because of the amenities. Having a great breakfast is a way to save money. This was the first time we took advantage of the dinner (we normally travel on weekends), and that was also great. Thank you for making our trip to Chicago such a success. Also a great pool area.

"The location is terrific, that's all. Read carefully: The hotel entrance lobby (extremely small) on 40 East Grand is on the ground level but registration and formal lobby is on the 6th floor! Only two elevators, very slow and overcrowded, take all the clients to floors 6 to 19. Valet staff didn't acknowledge us, possible language barrier. 6th floor registration area and lobby is large with 24 hr coffee/tea, a little store with snacks and other refreshments and sundries. Nice seating and large touch screen computer to check local attractions, restaurants, etc. That was nice! Registration went smoothly and said our room was a corner unit and would be much larger for our party. I was excited and hopeful that the rest of my experience would be nice. Not so. I wrote that service, value and rooms as poor because we asked for towels and didn't get them. We asked twice. Finally got towels from a late night security guard and had to raid a cart for supplies such as toilet paper and coffee. Elevators were a problem throughout our stay. Room was surprisingly small with narrow sitting room/kitchen area, door to average king bedroom, adjoining tiny bathroom sink area and door to absurdly large tub/shower, toilet room. Ceiling on shower wall was cracked and peeling from water damage. Kitchen was equipped but several cabinet doors couldn't open because of placement of appliances. Air Conditioning worked well. Breakfast staff and valet staff offered little to no customer service. Breakfast served on 6th floor - standard fare with small hot selection and make your own small waffles. Seating ample but staff made you give your room number and wait till they seated you as if they were a restaurant. Took my breakfast to my room because I didn't want to wait 1/2 hour to sit for crummy buffet. Food served 5 - 7 pm was gross but crowded because it was free with wine and beer served from communal carafe and tap. Chose not to eat at the evening buffet. Indoor Pool on 19th floor nice but heavily chlorinated and burned my eyes without swimming. Gym looked nice but didn't use the facility. Used the business center. Large center console meeting desk - perimeter with several computers to check your e-mails and print boarding passes. Plenty of pamphlets for all local attractions. There was a sign that said, 'If we can do anything to make your stay better, let us know"". Well, they can't increase the size of the ground floor lobby or the number of elevators or reconfigure the size of my room. However, they should re-evaluate the furniture which was old with flattened cushions. I couldn't pull out the sofa bed because of the size of the room and its position from the tv cabinet. It's not my job to move all the hotel furniture just so I can sleep. They can however work immediately on their customer service skills and reconfigure their breakfast location and menu. I think that the location is great but for your money stay around the corner at the Embassy Suites on State and Ohio. Brighter, nicer, working elevators, large rooms, just as convenient, excellent breakfast and service. Sorry Hilton, but as a Hilton Member you failed to make my grade."
"Stayed there for a week. Family holiday and first time in Chicago. Basically it's a suites hotel, but we basically wanted a base from which we could explore the city. With this in mind, the location was excellent. Almost everything we wanted to see was within walking distance as we're a range of good restaurants and of course the shops! We hardly used any public transport.The suite itself (for 3adults) was fine, one bedroom and a pull down bed in the living area and a good well equipped kitchen area. Shower, air conditioning and cleanliness were excellent, linen change on 3 days. Staff were friendly and helpful.Breakfast was a buffet and was adequate if limited and the breakfast room was small so there was generally a waiting time but this did not really worry us. Tea & coffee available at all times.Swimming pool was a great asset to refresh at the end of the day.We would use Homewood again - it's not a hotel but fit the bill for us.J C

"This was our 1st stay at a Homewood Suites Hotel since we usually find Hilton Gardens a good value when we travel. I was very surprised at how well run this hotel was during our week's stay.As others have said, the hotel is located right off Michigan Ave in the heart of downtown. Steps away from pubic transportation and within walking distance of dozens of restaurants and most of the city's main tourist attractions. We didn't need a car at all and a good thing since downtown traffic is what you would expect and parking rates very high.I keep my review short by just pointing out the hotel's positives and a few negatives.   o Excellent location in downtown Chicago o. Free (hot buffet) daily with fresh scrambled eggs, sausage, bagels, hot/cold cereals, juice, etc. o Well run breakfast dining room o. Quiet and clean rooms with nice city views and updated kitchens o. Proximity to bus and subway (made it to Wrigley Field in about 30 minutes). o. Well trained, friendly, and helpful staff o. Reasonably pricedA few negatives: o. Hotel only has two elevators - so waiting times can be long during tourist season o. Predominately families were staying here during our stay - this created long lines in the  breakfast room and at the elevators. While families have found this a good value hotel,  business travelers and couples may find this a negative.Travel Tip: Cab fare from O'Hare will run about $40 - $50 depending on time of day. Took the Blue Line located in the airport terminal right into downtown Chicago for $5 and saved a lot of money while also avoiding rush hour traffic."
"We chose this hotel because we are a family of 5 and this is one of the only hotels that offer a suite with two completely separate rooms, the kids in one room and the parents in the bedroom.Upon arrival we were greeted by very friendly valet staff who helped us with our bags and getting the kids out of the car. However, it took our bags nearly an hour to make it to our room and that included the all-important diaper bag. After a 7 hr car ride we were in desperate need of that bag. Rooms were smaller than expected and pretty dated but not horrible, just not nice either. Don't expect too much from the decor and you won't be disappointed. The hotels' location is in a good location, literally 10 minutes straight down to Navy Pier. The free breakfast was gross, seriously yucky. Again, don't expect too much, even our 10 yr old thought it was gross and he eats almost anything. We found it very irritating that the room's garbages were not changed the second day, and travelling with 3 kids, 2 of which are in diapers, this is gross and not what we expected...the room SMELLED like dirty diapers when we returned to our around 6pm that night. The third day was much worse. We returned to the room again around 5 ish, and again the room had not been cleaned. It smelled horrible. We had called the front desk in the morning and asked for dish detergent be sent up to our room that morning, but never received any. We had to call down again upon our return and finally just took some off one of the cleaning staffs carts. As we were discussing dinner plans we received a knock at our door and it was a herd of cleaning staff telling us they needed to clean our room NOW. I asked if they could return in half an hour and they said No, they were done for the day and needed to get in to clean. They retreated and told us they'd be back in 15 minutes, but instead came back after 5 mins, barged in, walking directly into the bedroom Without knocking while I was getting dressed. I had to hurry my family out of the room (try doing that with. 10 yr old, a 2 yr old and. 7mth old, not easy). Again, NOT HAPPY.We returned later that night and noticed that the fire alarm was beeping. We called the front desk and asked to have someone come up to change the battery because it appeared to be low. We stressed that we were trying to put the kids to bed and to please hurry. They sent someone up who replaced the fire alarm but guess what started beeping again soon after?!We were very unhappy with the service, they were slow and disinterested in making the customer happy (with the exception of the valet staff, they were great). Sigh, needless to say, we will not be returning."
"On Grand Ave. between State St. and Rush St. there is convenient bus service and less than a block from the Red Line rapid transit. Spacious rooms. Website says ""steps from Navy Pier"" but it's almost a mile. An easy walk or you can take a bus. Complimentary light breakfast daily and light dinner Monday through Thursday. Good location close to Michigan Ave. and many fine restaurants nearby. Health club with free weights and treadmills, along with an indoor pool."
"The men who worked on the ground floor, especially Amer, were wonderful. They always greeted us with a smile and were very happy to get us a cab. They were also very pleasant with my kids. Great job! This hotel as recommended to us by my colleagues and they apologized for the poor quality in food. They had stayed at this hotel about 3 or 4 years ago and they raved about the quality of the food at breakfast and the reception. This was not the case this trip. My kids liked the waffle station and I liked the coffee. The dinners were of poor quality. The room was good and we appreciated having a full kitchen for the week. The pool was in poor shape and needed to be cleaned and filled. However, the location of the hotel was fantastic."
"I recently booked not only myself but my staff and my clients (many of whom were from overseas) at the Homewood Suites and found my expectations exceeded in every way. The rooms are comfortable and clean, the kitchen with its full-sized refrigerator made light meals and quick snacks easy, and the location one block off Michigan and across the street from Nordstrom was perfect for our purposes. The staff was professional, courteous and outdid themselves, even when 14 boxes of books arrived unexpectedly that immediately had to be shipped elsewhere. I especially appreciated Veronica at the front desk, Nawar at the bell desk and Amer who were always ready with a smile and a sincere wish to be helpful. Homewood Suites helped me help my clients and enabled me to get the most out of my few hours of rest.


Room Tip: You can see the gorgeous Tribune building on the Chicago River. from the odd-numbered rooms.

"Stayed here from 23 to 28 June. The room was clean and really nice. Staff was very helpful. The door men could not have been better. They gave us many good ideas and directions. Morning breakfast was nice. Dinner in the afternoon is filling. All food was good. Next time in Chicago, I will definitely stay here. It has a nice central location.

"We knew when we drove to Chicago that we would not drive much while we were there and decide to pay to price of parking downtown. It only cost $1.00 extra to use the valet parking at the Homewood Suites and the gentlemen that were running that valet service were exceptional. The service was fast and the drivers were so hospitable. Always pleasant and willing to assist at all times. To Amir and all the men in that area, job well done. Thanks for being so kind and pleasant to guests. We really appreciated it. Barb"
Arriving at this hotel and walking into the grand lobby is breathtaking it's very Art Deco inside the hotel is just off Michigan avenue and 1 block from Lake Michigan. The rooms although small are well equipped and the bathrooms have oversized showers with rainforest shower heads in place of a bath. The hotel does have a bar and restaurant there however being within easy reach of plenty of other places to grab food and drinks. The staff are friendly and always smiling with a can do attitude.
"Millennium Knickerbocker is a stylish old hotel in the heart of Chicago! It makes you feel like you took back in time. Its location is excellent: Just off the famous Magnificent millennium and lake Michigan, so you are close to everything.I stayed at this hotel for 4 nights. Check in was fast and easy. I had a corner room, clean and large enough with comfortable bed and linens. Staff were friendly and helpful. They had great advice for getting the most of my stay in the city.I recommend this hotel to anyone for a pleasant stay in Chicago at an affordable price."
"For a stateside hotel, especially one in an old building, it is comfortable and the rooms fairly modern. As is a common problem with lots of downtown hotels in the US however the rooms are quite dark and when you delve a little deeper and look around the room it doesnt maintain the initial level of ""gloss"" that it is trying to portray. For such a central location it is fairly quiet which is a big bonus. The location is excellent however, just by the main shopping street of Michigan Avenue, in a classy and safe neighbourhood. Pros: Location, fairly modern roomsCons: Beds/pillows not the best quality, gym is very shabby."
"My parents visited me this weekend and we decided to all stay in River North. This hotel had great reviews, however I can't find much to say that is great.First night we are placed right outside of the elevator, a cramped room with a faulty fan and tv. Go to ask the front desk in the morning to switch rooms which they allowed but now have us in a room with stains on the carpet and again tv isn't working. Not sure if because it is the Final Four that they are blocking TBS.I won't be back."
"This was our first stay at the Nickerbocker, but it won't be the last. That is because the room was comfortable, but primarily because of your staff, especially Joshua. He checked us in where we felt at home, he was so kind and helpful. Secondly Craig was very helpful as well. In the end it is people who make the difference, and your Joshua is on the top of the list, in our opinion!Steve Albers"
"I can easily recommend this hotel to anyone who wants to stay in Chicago. Although it's a few blocks from the Loop and the CTA, a dozen bus routes pass nearby and it's ground zero for cabs, day or night. It's also ground zero for tourists, and if you're in town to do Magnificent Mile, deep dish pizza, etc, you could hardly do better than this place. They run excellent specials and you can get a room here at a deep discount on certain nights.The rooms are comparatively small, but why would you spend time in your room when there's so much to see and do outside?"
"Stayed at the Millenium for my bday weekend, was between here and the Drake. Should have stayed at the Drake. The Millenium was fine but with all the history I was hoping to feel like ""old chicago"" I guess the super small elevators and no room service is the only way you know you are in such a landmark. Rooms were small but well appointed and location was great. Not much to say just a standard stay"
"Nothing terribly wrong here - good location, o.k. bar, hotel room was small but o.k., bathroom fine, clean and pretty quiet. My biggest issues were: 1) the maid service banged on the door between 7:45 and 8:30 each morning. What? This is too early. I was on jet lag the first morning and this was really bad not to get an extra 45 mins of sleep before I had to get up; and 2) slow slow service in the restaurant at breakfast - of 3 mornings, 2 took me over an hour to eat. The first morning, it took a half hour to get coffee and to order then another 20 mins for food. They said the kitchen was behind but it didn't look that way - it looked like only one waiter for the entire room. I wouldn't let these things keep you away - you can put the privacy note on door, and plan ahead re breakfast but the hotel should make adjustments.


Room Tip: If you are not alone, ask about room size. They can be small.

"There is no denying that the Millennium Knickerbocker Hotel is old, if you have a split second of a doubt checkout the projector sitting over the doorway used to show sports at the bar. Aside from that there are little tip offs: small elevators and hallways, doors look worn, etc. However, I was wildly impressed with how modern the rooms were. I stayed overnight for a work commitment and got a great nights sleep. I'd recommend the Knickerbocker to anyone interested in staying in the area."
"We knew it was a beautiful, historic hotel with a great location, but we didn't know the phenomenal level of customer service we'd receive. The staff, led by a gentleman named Junior, was exceptionally friendly and supremely helpful in helping me coordinate a proposal in their gorgeous ballroom. The bar is warm and inviting, the rooms are clean and comfortable, and the staff makes the hotel feel like a home away from home. We will DEFINITELY be coming back to the Knickerbocker."
"Stayed for about four nights in August at the Millennium Knickerbocker in Chicago just off the Magnificent Mile. It's in a great location, walking distance to the shops on the mile and the lake in the other direction. Check in staff were delightful, really nice chap on the front desk. Room was nice, bed was big, decent tv and the bathroom modern and stylish with a waterfall shower. We even had a slither of a lake view through the window. Hotel has a real old school classy vibe which I liked, no pretensions of trying to be all modern and trendy, just a classy old school hotel that looks after its guests. The lobby is very grand and you might spend a lot of time there as the one drawback of the hotel is no wifi in the rooms, so you have to go down to the lobby if you don't want to pay. Overall, great place to stay, nice location, nice rooms, nice staff, the concierge even picked up my sunglasses and returned them for me when I left in them in the lobby."
"We stayed a the knickerbocker hotel this past weekend and it was wonderful. We had a suite (which was unexpected) which was spacious and clean. The staff was friendly at check in and check out. The room was extremely quiet and, though we weren't, it seemed like we were the only ones on the floor. Our biggest complaint was the bath towels. For such a nice hotel, its like drying off with a loofah. The entrance to the hotel is beautiful, but the check in desk looks out of place. It could stand to be upgraded. I would recommend this hotel and would stay here again in the future!"
"We stayed for 2 nights to see the David Bowie exhibit at a nearby museum. The hotel staff was very courteous and went the extra mile to make sure our stay was a good one. We received an upgrade to a suite on a higher floor, which was very unexpected but definitely appreciated. The room was clean and quiet, of course since it was a suite- it was spacious. There was ample closet space and the bathroom was quite big, especially for a hotel. The only complaint we had was the mattress. It was soft, not what we are used to. Not sure if that was why we woke up several times during the night. All in all, it wasn't a major issue- more like a preference for a firmer mattress. The location is good for anyone who wants to be near Michigan Ave/Magnificent Mile."
"You can't beat the Knickerbocker if you want a centrally located -- tucked away on a quiet street just off of Michigan Ave -- and comfortable, well appointed hotel in Chicago. Our room was spacious, very clean, and quiet. Comfy beds and good quality linen. The staff was friendly and helpful. Concierge Cheryl was especially helpful with great recommendations on what to see and do. On a busy Friday night, she got us into the popular Gino's East restaurant in about 10 minutes, while others waiting about an hour.

"I booked this hotel online with a AAA room rating. I had some questions at various times which were answered promptly. I needed to add a night to my booking just prior to my stay & there was no problem at all. The hotel was clean. The room was quite large with a queen size bed but the view from my room was looking south into another building. I was on the 11th floor. The hotel is close to many attractions, bus service & rail service. Michigan Avenue is within walking distance. I was heading to a Ballgame at Wrigley Field & took the red line train straight to the park from Chicago/State, quite close as well."
"First impression was how friendly and helpful all the staff were. At check-in, after looking to see what rooms were available, we were told ""Sorry, we don't have a room with a view. It just looks onto the street"". Feeling a little disappointed, we got to our room on the 3rd floor and ....... wow! This was the best room we had stayed in during our month long vacation. Sure, it looked out on East Walton Place but it was so quite. The room was BIG (at least by European standards). It was tastefully furnished, had a king (6' ft) bed with wonderful crisp sheets, an ample cupboard for hanging clothes with plenty of hangers, and a big bathroom with a walk-in shower. There were plenty of nice soft towels which got freshened up every day. Maid service was outstanding! We ate breakfast twice in 4 days - outstanding food & service. The staff at the cocktail bar, which we used every day!, were charming and knew how to make a great Margarita! Only complaint was there were 2 t/v's in the lounge constantly showing sport (well, baseball & American football if that's what you call sport!! I'm English and was brought up on Soccer, Rugby & Cricket - now, that's what I call sport!). Be careful of using the in-room monitor for internet access. If you do use it and you also use an i.pad/laptop as well, you might be charged twice the daily rate. We were, but queried the charge on checking out and the bill was reduced. We thought we had to use the in-room monitor to initially log on. The room was big enough for me to leave some of my clothes behind! Once back in the UK, I phoned the hotel and it was confirmed my belongings were in ""lost & found"". They were parceled up and sent to a friend in the Chicago area with no fuss and a minimal charge. I cannot rate this hotel highly enough - especially for the courteous service."
"Stayed at the Knickerbocker from 15/09/14 for a week and had a great time. Hotel is in a perfect location just off the Magnificent Mile so it is a bit quieter. As soon as we arrived we met Charlie on the front door who helped us park y son's car for a great rate compared to the car park over the road. Had lots of chats with Charlie throughout the week and he told us all about the history of the hotel and the links with Al Capone which was fascinating. Charlie was great to talk to and just a shame that he wasn't working the day we checked out, hope he liked the card we left for him. The hotel lobby was nice with a comfortable bar area. When we checked in Simeon was very helpful and gave us a nice room on the 5th floor. The room was a good size, bed was huge and comfortable, TV was large and there was a useful information TV that helped us to pick out some good restaurants and attractions. The large rainhead shower was great and I had no problems with the water pressure unlike some reviews on here. We didn't have breakfast included in our rate so we did eat in the Nix restaurant on a few occasions and here we met another star in Andre who was so polite and helpful and always made us feel welcome. It was my wife's birthday while we were there and Andre gave her a free breakfast which was so generous. Again only regret was that on our last day Andre was working but again we hoped he liked the card we left for him. The hotel itself is in a great location with all the bars, shops and restaurants of Magnificent Mile on one side and close to the beach on the other side. This is an historic hotel that has been modernised but not too much and still retains an older charm. If you are looking for a modern/chic hotel then look elsewhere, but if you are looking for a grand old hotel which is comfortable and has brilliant staff then try the Knickerbocker. We'll be coming back to Chicago on a regular basis as our son has moved there so Charlie and Andre were coming to see you soon!

"We have friends from Sao Paulo, S.Am. and when they came to visit, we reserved rooms at the Knickerbocker. Wonderful staff...very helpful. Our last evening there, the band (trio) in the bar in the lobby just happened to be playing Latin music. Loved it. Just felt like we were enclosed in a golden cocoon. Of course the drinks may have had something to do with that. Would go back again and again."
We were in Chicago for 5 days slowly making our way across the country. We were greeted by such friendly staff. The girl from New Zealand at check in was helpful in providing a map and circling areas she though we she explore first. The man that was at the concierge desk at night (I forgot his name) was great at providing advice about restaurants etc. And Craig one of the doormen was hilarious. All the bellboys were quite friendly and always had something nice to say.Having stayed at several hotels during our vacation the knickerbocker was one of the few where we felt we could always ask someone for help or advice and we would receive it with enthusiasm. The location was great just minutes from the magnificent mile...very close to Ghirardelli (best desserts ever)
"This is a great hotel perfect for the shore,shops and sightseeingThe room was the best we had in travelling in the U.S. With the best most comfortable bed with excellent linen,the room had plenty of storage space and the shower room was spacious with quality fittings and towelsAgain we are surprised about comment about the Hotel being dated this a beautiful Hotel with classic style,do Americans appreciate heritage ? It's like saying Windsor Castle is old fashioned!! The lift is perfectly adequate and not particularly small,you should see some in Europe 2 people and a caseWe found the staff helpful and very pleasant and the bar staff mix a mean cocktail Breakfasts were delicious although we only had two out of 4 days as we did brunch in the Hancocks Tower and a light meal in the little Italian at the base of the Hancock which was really goodWe would certainly recommend the Knickerbocker for a lovely stay in Chicago We had a small problem with our bill over Wifi access don't use the in room device to log in as you get charged twice if you have an Ipad but it was easily sorted out it is quite expensive any way"
"I am a Chicago native and chose to stay at the Millennium Knickerbocker Hotel for my September wedding. Our room was booked 7 months in advance by calling the actual hotel, referencing our room block and receiving a coupe email confirmations. One day before we were supposed to check in (2 days before our wedding) the hotel sends an email to me that they are no longer able to accommodate our booking for a Presidential Suite. I politely asked why and agreed with the sales coordinator - Justin - we could go ahead and take two adjoining rooms since we needed the space for bridesmaids to get ready in. Upon arrival on Friday, we checked in, get to our room and do NOT have two adjoining suites. Long story short, we went back down to the front desk, complained as this is the second time they messed up our reservation and now only one day before our wedding and hours before guests were arriving and our rehearsal dinner. While the front desk gentleman was very polite and accommodating, the sales coordinator and supervisor were both quite rude and could really care less that they made numerous mistakes, though we several room blocks filled. We really received no sincere apology and the property itself is very dated (they argue historic) and not worth the price. Definitely do not recommend staying here, especially for a major event. Really terrible customer service."
"Recently stayed three nights over the labor day weekend and booked the trip via expedia. Staff was very friendly. We arrived at 9 am Friday and when we asked if they would hold our bags until check in, they said they had a room available and waived the early check in fee. Which was appreciated. We had a king size supreme room which was clean. The bathroom only had a shower, which while very nice, had no place to put a foot up when you wanted to shave your legs. Its just one of those little things that only a woman would notice. I loved that they provided bathrobes. The location is great for walking and exploring the city. My only complaint was they did not provide free wi-fi, which I expect most hotels to provide. It seemed stingy to me for such a nice hotel to not provide that service to their guests. We did not eat at their restaurant or drink at the bar as there are too many other options within the city.I highly recommend the Belgian Bakery about a block and a half up Walton. They had the best baked goods in the city for a reasonable price and very high quality. I also recommend the Indian restaurant next to the bakery. They have a very good Indian buffet for a reasonable price."
"This deal through Travelzoo was fantastic. The hotel was updated, clean, professional and welcoming. The hotel staff was accommodating and very helpful. We asked, and they recommended the easiest and least expensive way to get where we wanted to go, and hooray, it worked out wonderful. The breakfast was included and very good and great coffee! We had a whole group going to the Detroit Tiger game and we had a blast. The city is so clean and friendly, I love it."
"We recently stayed at the ""Knick"" and very much enjoyed our stay. While the hotel is not perfect I feel it offers value like few others in the Magnificent Mile area. Booking very far in advance we found a rate that was extraordinary for the labor day weekend. This allowed me and my traveling partner (my mother) to book seperate rooms which assuredly made our stay truly enjoyable. The rooms were well kempt and wholly satisfactory, but in truth were small and not meant to accomodate more than two persons. Indeed, if possible, single occupancy would be optimal. This reflects the fact that this is a historic hotel from an era where small rooms were the norm.  The plus for this hotel, besides the very good rooms, are a superior location that is less congested (and more peaceful) than the area immediate south of this area. Moreover, it is close to a host of excellent restaurants including Luxbar and Gibson's. Often, at cocktail hour, a pianist performs in the lobby which adds to the atmosphere. On one evening the pianist played ""Somewhere over the Rainbow,"" which promted an audience member to perform an interpretive dance with scarf to that rendition. On the following night the pianist played a request of the mellifluous and haunting ""Laura"" with a slightly jazzy interpretation that was perfect for the lobby setting. The admontions of the property are that the rooms in general are not especially large, the doors lack dead bolts for additional security, and the air conditioning units tend to be rather noisy. In truth, I ended up turning off the AC while I slept. If shopping is your perogative this is an ideal location as it is proximal to Macy's, Bloomy's, and Chicago's Rodeo Drive, that is Oak Street. In the end, the vast majority of persons wiil be pleased by their stay at th Millenium Knickerbocker."
"The location: Excellent location as we were in town to explore. Right off of Mag Mile and a block from the John Hancock tower. Also, an amazing Belgian bakery just a block away. Super close to the water's edge as well!The staff: Just fine. Check-in and check-out was a breeze. The only small issue was when we wanted to leave our bags after we checked-out because we had some exploring to do before catching the train out of town. The woman at the front desk did not communicate very well as to who would be taking the bags. We waited a couple minutes off to the side (the lobby was very busy and people were checking in) and finally I approached the bellhop and he took care of us. Also, we had asked for additional towels and another robe at the reservation desk late one evening, they were brought to us promptly. The room: Carpet needs replacing. Bed was very comfortable and everything was clean. Loved the shower head. Seemed like the whole room could use some updating as the wallpaper was peeling a bit in the corners near the floor. The PC in our room was useless to us as we were definitely not paying to surf the web and the recommended restaurants and attractions was extremely limited (I'm assuming the only ones listed were those that chose to pay an advertisement fee). Also, wifi is free in the lobby however, $11 in the room- seems a bit steep as many hotels today offer free wifi. Overall: Felt like I was paying for the name on the building and not the actual experience. We did not have a chance to explore the restaurant and bar on site as our time was limited. Will most likely try out another hotel in the same area next time in the city."
"My family and I went and stayed at the knickerbocker on a Travelzoo package, so i was a bit concerned we would be treated ""differently"" than their regular guest, this was not the case at all! As a matter if fact we could not have been treated better! Everyone and I mean everyone was simply amazing, the friendliest staff i have ever encountered. The rooms were beautiful and upscale the food was excellent. Close to so many of Chicago's attractions, i give this hotel 5 plus stars!! now I have to give some extra credit for 3 exceptional members of the staff! Charlie The Door Man (I wish I knew his last name) made our stay truly exceptional he went out of his was every time we saw him, he took us on a personal tour of the grand ballroom and told us for the rich history the hotel has we never would had that opportunity had it not been for Charlie! Thank You Charlie for the great service you really love your job and it shows! then our waiter Andre again someone who loves his job, you made our breakfast an experience not just eating! and then Simon when we had a minor concern with our bill you graciously helped me and rectified it quickly and happily thank you all for a awesome experience we will be back!!!

"This was my first visit to Chicago , not so my partner who had been before on business and had stayed at the Knickerbocker on one of these occasions and been impressed. It was my big birthday trip and was therefore hoping to be wowed myself. I was not disappointed.Our room was,well appointed, spacious and clean as was the shower room. The lobby/ bar area is pleasant and welcoming, be careful if the cocktails served as they are much stronger than you would get in an English barThe only thing to let this hotel down was that the restaurant was not open in the evening in the earlier part of the week and as we had planned to dine in on our first night - my birthday- it was a disappointment. perhaps we should have checked ahead but you do expect a city hotel of this size to have full dining service,we could have eaten at the bar but not the special treat we where looking for. Conveniently situated for both the lakeside and shopping centres.Breakfast was a bit expensive but the food was good there is the option of buffet or full service menu."
"This hotel deserves the highest praise it's staff are first class the room is lovely and the location 2 blocks from Macy's could not be bettered. The hotel is minutes from the lakeside promenade and is centrally located for both the Navy pier and Lincoln park Zoo. Have thoroughly enjoyed Chicago and recommend this hotel every time.

Our room was a knock out with soft bed, linens and pillows. The bathroom was modern and elegant. Staff was always smiling and helpful. We ate breakfast for the 2 mornings in the Nix restaurant and it was delicous. Our waiter Alex was extremely friendly and attentive.

"This summer my hubby and I went on our honeymoon. He had never been to Chi town so that's where we went. I am forever grateful that I chose this hotel. The staff really goes over and beyond the call of duty to make guests comfortable and happy. When we first arrived the guy at the desk, Simeon, and I were talking and I mentioned that it was our honeymoon. The next thing I know there was a knock on my door and we were greeted with chocolate strawberries and champaign! What a special treat! Our personal bellman Craig was very helpful. Andre and Minerva who served us in the restaurant were also very professional and personable. The beauty of the hotel provides a very nostalgic and refreshing experience. The food was superb! I highly recommend this hotel."
"This is a lovely hotel, don't get me wrong. Full of character, nice staff, comfy king size bed. I'm giving it just 3 points because a hotel without room service is a huge issue for me. I really cannot understand the reason why they dint have room service. I know we have plenty of options just a few minutes away, I know we can order food from the bar and take it upstairs, I know we can order food from outside but guess what, after a long flight I just want to stay in my room, have some food and sleep. And I don't know why, but the air con in my room was programmed for 16C , so my room was freezing cold. But apart from that, lovely hotel."
"Stayed at the hotel for a birthday celebration and girls night out weekend! The hotel itself is beautiful and is in a good location. That is the good stuff. The bad there is NO parking garage or street parking for patrons of the hotel. So you have to pay between $42 and 80$ to park your car overnight. The hotel staff was just ok. They screwed up the reservation even after a call was made prior to us checking in to verify that 2 rooms with 2 queen beds were reserved. when we arrived the guy says there are no more queen beds and because the reservation was made through hotwire it couldn't be guaranteed. We ended up sharing a 1 bed king suite and a 1 bed king regular room among 7 women. the suite did have a pull out sofa bed but to me the check in staff was unapologetic and really didn't try to accommodate everyone. the cleaning staff was good but were rude. The staff working outside and the concierge were very friendly and made the hotel stay worth staying. The room itself was ok. the carpet was worn and they should replace it. The bathroom was really nice and the suite had an excellent jet Jacuzzi. The overhead shower and hand-held nozzle was very nice as well .The Wi-Fi was not free....in fact they charged for all extra amenities. For a luxury hotel you really only pay for the name and location but everything else they charge you for. The bed was comfortable but the decorative runner across the bed had stains on it. The bar area was nice and they made good drinks. The bar staff was very nice. Overall the hotel stay was just ok. I would not have chosen this hotel because I prefer to have a more modern look and feel and this is a historic feel hotel but I was with a group and the majority won!


Room Tip: The 2 room king suite is very nice!

"Pluses are many. Lovely hotel right in the centre of shops and restaurants, near to Hancock tower. Very helpful staff especially the concierge and bus boys out the front who recommended a number of local breakfast places. Two minutes away from a beach!!!! What a fantastic place to walk cycle or jog with incredible views alongside Lake Michigan Lots to see and do. Only downside is the lack of local subway station so everything is walking taxis or buses. Aircon is a bit loud at times but not a real problem. Local restaurants are many but very busy. Eg Cheesecake Factory under Hancock tower"
"This hotel was perfect for a city trip to Chicago. It is located in the upscale Gold Coast neighbourhood which is walkable and safe. The hotel is nice, with a beautifully decorated lobby and nice martini bar. The staff were helpful, Paul gave us lots of great advice on transit and sightseeing. The rooms are clean and comfortable and the rain showers were a nice feature. Breakfast is available, but you can find better value at nearby coffee shops if you are happy with a quick bite. There is a limited selection of restaurants around the hotel, I would recommend planning ahead for dinner so you don't waste time wandering the neighbouring streets looking for a place to eat. As you walk towards the Loop, you will find more dining options."
"We stayed during a girls getaway had a double room on the third floor. The room smelled very strange when we first arrived but the second day after they cleaned it, it was a little better. We never ate breakfast or lunch it was very pricey but nice that they offer those things. The location really was the selling point for us right next to the magnificent mile and a short distance to the beach."
"We stayed 5 nights in The Knickerbocker Hotel on Walton in Chicago. The location is 3 minutes from Oak Street Beach and 5 minutes from the junction of N State & N Rush where visitors will find a little hidden treasure of bars, restaurants and fantastic nightlife as well as great shops. The hotel is old and with plenty of character and the rooms modern and well apportioned, one little downside is having to pay for WiFi in the rooms. It's free in the Lobby, I would also like to mention the Staff really helpful and friendly. If you get a chance to stay here I would recommend you take it."
"I stayed at the Millennium Knickerbocker for a reunion of college friends in late June. The staff was extremely helpful, particularly the Concierge desk where recommendations were sought and several reservations for nearby restaurants were made. Housekeeping and support staff were also very pleasant and helpful to this group. The breakfast area and bar accommodated our needs beautifully. The bar...

"Just got back from 3 day stay here. Lobby of hotel is very ornate and beautiful. Small restaurant to the left and a nice size bar area to the right. Check in was flawless and front desk staff were very friendly. Sixth floor room with king bed. Room was a little crammed with this bed. Dressers and end tables were old and worn. Swivel chair at desk was from the eighties and falling apart. Bathroom was very modern with updated fixtures and and huge walk in shower with rain shower head. The bed was very comfy but the pillows were very soft. The room was very clean and neat. Hotel is at north end of Magnificent Mile and 1 block east of Michigan ave. It is about 12 blocks north of the Chicago river so it is not exactly centrally located. We had very good weather for the first two days so we did not mind walking everywhere we wanted to go. 5 stars for the service here but 3 stars for the room. Got a deal on Hotwire but do not thnk I would pay full price to stay here.

"As a partner in the restaurant industry, I wanted to take a minute to recognize and thank the Knickerbocker for a great stay... But, that's not the purpose of this review / write up. In my haste to jump in a cab, with a phone attached to my ear, I left behind my bag. I immediately contacted the hotel and Simeon located it quickly and I said I would turn around and return. If Chicago traffic wasn't bad enough, battling it once, now I get to enjoy it three times... Oh well, my fault, right? Seconds later Simeon calls me back and says, Mr. Kendall, no need to return, I will put your bag in a car and have it sent to you at the airport.That's service! Not to mention a HUGE time saver. Simeon, I thank you very much and please, never stop that level of care, concern and hospitality.CheersBrian Kendall"
"People say that visiting Chicago in July is a toss-up. It could be hot and humid, is was not. It could be raining and thunderstorms, it wasn't. We were met by mid 70's and 57% (which is low for Chicago) and everyday was a true adventure. Our hotel is an art-deco style building in the heart Chicago, built in mid 1920's with NIX a breakfast and lunch bright, colorful eatery with some great music provided by our knowledgeable waiter Andre. Some people might say it is a bit pricey, but your in a 5 star hotel in Chicago. Front desk staff was pleasant and quick to assist you. People also have said that the WiFi in rooms should be free, but again if your on vacation why do you need WiFi. The rooms have not been changed from when they were new so they seem small to some guests. The elevators are original size too also a bit small but OK. If you need assistance from concierge both Cheryl and her counterpart really know their stuff. Stop by most anytime to find out about eateries, museums, boat tours, etc. The deco style bar in lobby area had a special 'Tapas and Flamenco evening with great ""small dishes"" like fajitas chicken egg rolls-yummy, huge green-lipped mussels from New Zealand-largest we have ever seen and delicious, and more. We could not ask for better with fabulous guitarists and beautiful Spanish dancer.Those were the best comments. The worst are that hotel charges $65 a day to park a car (outrageous) The new computers in rooms need correcting they go on at 8 a.m. and if you pull the plug-it will disconnect your telephone. All in all the Millennium Knickerbocker Hotel Chicago was great!

"I highly recommend this hotel. All of the hotel personnel that I interacted with were so professional and helpful- from the concierges at the front desk to the staff at the check in desk. For example, I arrived much earlier than expected and thought I would check my bags until a room was available. But as soon as I arrived, the staff at the greet desk suggested I go to the check in desk. At the check in desk, the staff immediately looked to see if a room was available and it was. She didn't have to do this and it was a busy time in the lobby. Also later I had to ask for directions from another staff person at the greet desk and he also was very helpful and knowledgeable. Even the maids were polite, smiling and helpful.The room itself was really great. Quiet. Well designed. I even had a bit of a view of the Lake! It is a fantastic location. Quiet. So close to the beaches. I went for a wonderful walk in the morning on the lakeshore. At checkout the person who helped me also was very friendly and polite. This is a very carefully and well managed hotel. All of the aspects of my experience did not happen by accident. I was very impressed by the quality in all aspects.

"You could not book a hotel in a better location. At the corner of Michigan Ave for shopping, State Ave for nightlife and great restaurants, and 5 mins away from the beach. Wifi is 10$ per day, but complimentary in the lobby. We were 4 in a room and it was totally fine: The bathroom and amenities are great, the bed and pillows quite comfy. The staff is friendly and the place was spotless. But again... location location location!

"This hotel was brilliant, central location in Chicago, easy to walk to many restaurants and bars. The staff were very helpful and friendly. We were there during the World Cup and the bar had themed specials on for food and alcohol for each game which was fun.The restaurant is only open for breakfast and there is no room service however the bar has a small bar bites menu running. Not really an issue considering how many wonderful restaurants are close.Room was lovely and clean, free wifi in lobby and bar area."
"This place is excellent and I would recommend to anyone. The restaurant, bar, lobby and rooms were all clean and well maintained. The staff were all very friendly and courteous. The location is fantastic.Instead of paying $65/night to park our car w/a valet at the hotel, we parked in a public garage at Orleans & Hubbard and paid $28/night. We didn't mind and for a difference of almost $40/night, we didn't mind the extra walk as we walked all around during our stay."
"The hotel is in a great location and the room is modernized style and clean. The only issue is some staff may not be very helpful with their duty which includes concierge who does not have answers on several tourist questions, bell man who does not open the door but standing next to the door that you need to be careful while pushing open it. We got a promotion deal which we are not expect high quality service. But to the people who pay regular price, you may want to be prepared that the hotel service may short of your money."
"You really cannot go wrong staying here. It's a small, stylish historic hotel with an intimate boutique atmosphere to it. It has the air of a place that people ""in the know"" would stay at. You're going to feel a bit special - and smart - for picking it. For the price, location, and comfort, it's perfect.I was initially a bit worried about being so close to the bustle of Michigan Ave, but the location of the hotel is one of its best features. It's about a block north of where the real touristy, shopping portions end, so it's quiet and tucked away from the chaos while simultaneously very close to high-end shopping and sights. You're near to the Red Line on Chicago Ave., and you're also right at the intersection of quite a few bus routes (If you're feeling adventurous, that is. Just ask the concierge for some tips; it's honestly one of the easiest ways to move about the city). You are not going to have difficulty getting where you need to go.Staff was exceptionally kind, quick, and friendly. Room was clean. The king-sized bed was plush and restful, and the pillows are super soft, which is a must for me. Bathrooms are clean, chic, and modern; I always looked forward to showering. Everything was cozy, comfortable, and well designed. And make sure to stop by the bar downstairs. They have a couple cocktails that will really hit the spot after a day around town.Just stop looking around for a place to pick for your stay in Chicago. You've found it. This is it."
"My stay at this hotel was ideal. The location is perfect; near to the beach, Navy Pier, shopping, and dining. The hotel staff were exceptional with just the right touch of hospitality. The man who prepared my drink at the Martini Bar was very helpful to me, a novice when it comes to Martinis. The waiter in the restaurant was pleasant as he served my early morning breakfast of delicious salmon and eggs with Hollandaise. The front desk staff were helpful and cordial as were the concierge staff. My room was clean, the bed oh so comfy and clean. Believe me, I checked it right down to the mattress. As a woman traveling alone, I felt safe because they knew I was there. My name was on the welcome screen in my room. I even got a phone call seconds after I submitted my review of my stay. The staff were accommodating and professional. It felt comfortable and homey in the midst of Chicago.

"This is not a top of the line, 5 star hotel. However, it has everything a trip advisor fan looking for an excellent bargain wants: location, updated and well appointed rooms, very helpful and considerate staff, and service and amenities that far exceed the price. We even managed to find a discount coupon that included an upgraded room, free breakfast, and $25 credit for the bar. Without question, I will stay here again. We had excellent accomadations and saved a lot of money by using internet discount coupons for the hotel and parking. A great vacation.

"This hotel is in a good location - the North end of the Magnificent Mile. Close to Navy Pier, Millennium Park, the red line of the CTA, shopping and restaurants. It's an old hotel but the rooms have been renovated. I really liked the lobby bar and the general historic feel of the common areas. The room was spacious (there was 3 of us) and the bathroom had both a jacuzzi tub and a shower. My only complaints about the hotel is the maid service was very poor. She really just made our beds. She didn't restock our glasses or leave extra toilet paper or put the ironing board away. She left behind a dirty dusting rag. Our mini bar fridge didn't work so we couldn't put food in it and not that I generally drink things from the bar but I certainly wouldn't if the beverages were warm ie beer. None of these things, however, are deal breakers and I would totally recommend this hotel."
"We were recently in Chicago for a business trip and stayed for the first time at the Millennium Knickerbocker, and it was an absolutely wonderful experience. We were there for three days and three nights, and there is a European essence and timelessness to this hotel that is very warm and inviting. My room was nicely appointed and found it to be quite comfortable. It had elegant touches throughout and the service was excellent. We also ate in the bar area two nights and once for lunch. It is a relatively simple menu, and I can highly recommend the tomato soup, club sandwich, burger and all of the appetizers. It was a relaxing environment with an old world sophistication that we really liked. The service and people working at the hotel were warm with engaging personalities, and this was one of the points of difference that we noticed throughout. It felt very well managed overall. The Millennium is extremely well located, right across from the Drake, and whether it is shopping, or in our case a Trade Show, we found it to be super-convenient. I highly recommend the Millennium Knickerbocker if you are looking for a great hotel with timeless charm and hospitality."
"This is a historic hotel which has recently been renovated. The room was attractive, quiet and clean. The bed was comfortable. On the first floor, the restaurant and bar are good for people watching. The location is just steps from Michigan Avenue, with its shopping, restaurants and entertainment. It is also very close to the beach on Lake Michigan. I stayed for one night and was very pleased.


Room Tip: higher floors will have better city and/or lake views than the lower floors

"This is an elegant and beautiful old hotel situated just off the magnificent mile, across the street from the Drake, and steps from amazing shopping. The staff is courteous and accommodating, and the beds are comfortable. The elevators are small, but that is to be expected in old hotels, and the maintenance staff quickly repaired one when it broke. But what holds this back from being an excellent hotel is the lack of attention to details. The coffee maker, coffee, and coffee accoutrements in the room were poor quality and disappointing. The bathroom products minimal and of poor quality. Thank goodness the bedding was nice. There is no room service; the hotel could make available a series of menus for delivery. More attention to small details, which probably would not cost the hotel a lot, would go a long way to making this an excellent hotel. We did valet parking (at $60!!! a night). The valet people left our car lights on and ran down the battery, so when we went to pick up the car we had to wait an hour. We had planned to go to the aquarium, but cancelled our plans for lack of time, and a desire to run the car for a longer time before turning it off again to fully re-charge the battery. The valet guys did not seem overly concerned about this situation, but when they saw we were upset, they refunded our 2 night of valet parking, which was very good. I would stay here again, but without a car."
"Had a great overnight stay here through a Travelzoo deal that included the Executive Room for one night, a lounge credit of $25.00, and two breakfasts for $99.00. The location was perfect..one half block east of N Michigan Avenue just north of the John Hancock building. The beds were comfy, and all needs were met during our stay. The morning's hotel bill, however, that was slid under the door, reflected additional charges of $77.00 (?), an additional $10.00 for an upgrade, and additional tax charges, which totaled nearly $100.00. A quick visit to the main desk downstairs resulted in the hotel correcting errors that they stated they had made due to coding of the stay having been improperly entered at time of reservation. They removed all additional charges except for the $7.00 in room taxes which I expected to pay. I didn't need the distress, but was happy they corrected it as I have two more evenings this summer with this same deal which is excellent!

"Pros - (1) great location on East Walton across from The Drake Hotel, 2 short blocks from Water Tower Place, surrounded by Magnificent Mile shopping and restaurants; (2) rooms are clean and tastefully designed, quiet, with comfortable beds; (3) got a good price with a special offer on the website ($100-125 per room); (4) friendly helpful staffCons - (1) $65 per day valet parking (public parking around the block is $32 per day but no in and out privileges); (2) bathrooms small with sliding door that is not that private and overhead shower that is not easy to adjust; (3) breakfast service was slow; buffet is quick, of course, but lacking some standards (such as oatmeal, bagels, granola, bananas); (4) outdated computers in business office slow and prone to crash, even just printing boarding passes; (5) small exercise room had 6 treadmill/elliptical machines, small free weight area with one bench and a limited machine. ."
"Spent two days in Chicago at one of the BEST hotels I have stayed in. This hotel was in a perfect location and had some of the nicest staff. Easy walking distance to the beach and to one of the largest shopping areas around. Parking was a little high but you are in Chicago! Breakfast was very good and awesome window seating. Thanks for an awesome trip!

"I brought my sister to Chicago for a girls weekend and we stayed at the Millennium near the Hancock Building. Great location with easy walking access to Michigan Ave as well as Lake Shore Blvd. The hotel is older but doesn't feel out of date. Room was small but nicely decorated. Beds were super comfortable and the rain shower head made the bathroom amazing. Pricy, but it was worth it. Would recommend using Priceline or Hotwire to get a better deal."
"This was my first trip to Chicago and one of my travelling companions had so enjoyed her stay at Millenium Knickerbocker Hotel last year that we all decided to stay here this time. The hotel is well situated near the lakefront and CBD so venturing out was easy. The rooms are well appointed with very comfy beds and bathrooms. The staff made us feel welcome and assisted us very ably to find tour information, taxis etc. The lobby bar was well-stocked and we were able to wind down after our busy days with a delicious cocktail. In all the Millenium Knickerbocker gave a great introduction to Chicago - there were only a couple of points that disappointed. Firstly, there was no free wi-fi which was a bit of a nuisance and seems a bit behind the times. Also, the rooms were equipped with a touch-screen PC which was meant to provide information about nearby attractions. I found this a bit bewildering to use and rather limited in scope, but I imagine this is a work in progress. I wouldn't hesitate to stay here again."
"Hotel has a wonderful location, as its very-very close to Magnificent Mile which is famous for shopping and dining. We had dinners at Michael Jordan's Steakhouse and next evening at Weber's Grill and both restaurants were within an easy walking distance.Breakfast quaility in the Hotel is not an award winning level, but its not bad. Just average.Rooms is spacious and quiet.Checkout was really slow as there were only 2 staff there."
"I arrived at the hotel the night before my daughter was graduating from medical school. A big event in our family. When we checked into the hotel, they had said that Expedia had cancelled our reservation and they were totally booked. That was strange since we booked and paid for our hotel room two months prior on Hotels.com ($99 rate). Hotels.com had just sent us a reminder about our upcoming reservation just days prior. We got the manager involved and they somehow found a room for us. The hotel was good (if a nice view isn't important), but that experience did not sit well with us. Especially after we saw several instances of this happening with other people in the hotel reviews. Word of caution, if you book this hotel at a super low rate, call to confirm your reservation before you arrive."
"One night stay here when I was visiting downtown prior to a wedding outside of Chicago. As others have said, the location is excellent. Very convenient for shopping on and around Michigan Ave. The hotel itself is great. The doormen and concierge were very helpful with bags and dining recommendations. We were allowed to check in at 11, even though formal check-in isn't until 3PM. Stayed in a King room. It was clean and well-amenitized. Room was updated, bed was comfortable. I will admit however that the King rooms are not very spacious. With all the furniture there's not much floor room to put your stuff. Only real complaint I had about the room was that there isn't a fan in the bathroom. This can be a problem for obvious reasons, exaggerated by the fact that the bathroom door is not a normal door, but a pocket-sliding door. By no means a deal-breaker. Overall very pleased with this stay. Will definitely look here first for my next trip to Chicago."
"What a horrible experience. I cannot recommend this hotel to anyone who values knowing their reservation is secure. My reservation was made through Expedia months earlier. I showed up - with my confirmation number - and they tried to tell me that Expedia had moved me! Yet Expedia still showed me at the Millennium. Why would Expedia move me and still charge me the Millennium rate? Here's what I believe happened. With multiple conferences in Chicago, they were booked. Others told me some rooms in town were going for twice what I paid through Expedia because they tried to book so late. I believe the Millennium took my reservation then realized later they could get more for the room. So they canceled me. They set me up in a cheaper hotel and pocketed the difference. To say the least, they are not customer friendly."
"I stayed at the Millennium Knickerbocker this week on a business trip for just one night. The hotel is a nice manageable size. Check-in is a little challenging to notice initially as it it to the rear of the lobby. The rooms are tastefully done in a soothing contemporary style. Beds are comfortable. Though I didn't use lobby bar, it's attractive and open. The hotel restaurant food was above average. No newstand/guest shop in the hotel. It does have a fitness center, which I didn't use. Throughout my stay, I found the staff friendly and helpful. Location is just off Michigan Avenue so it's a good location for shopping. I've stayed in much more luxurious hotels but I would definitely stay here again. It's good value for the money."
"I purchased a voucher on TravelZoo for a 2 night stay at the Knick. I hadn't stayed there in probably 17 years but remembered that it was a fabulous location. My friend and I were able to check in early and catch a cab to the White Sox/Indians game with time to spare. Over the course of the next two days, we shopped and ate and shopped and ate and made multiple trips back to our rooms with our goodies. Each and every time, the doormen were friendly and courteous and we were greeted by staff inside the hotel as well. There was never a wait for a cab when needed, housekeeping was friendly and thorough and the food at the Nix was fresh and delicious. My only regret is that I didn't purchase a second voucher but I would willingly stay at the Knick again with or without one! Kudos to you!"
"I've stayed at the Millennium Knickerbocker for four years in a row while attending a trade show. Rooms are small but luxurious. Wonderful staff. Perfect boutique hotel atmosphere. Great lobby bar and the restaurant serves a wonderful breakfast. They've upgraded me for no reason a number of times simply as a nice gesture. Location is a block off the Magnificent Mile so it doesn't get any better. Would highly recommend.

"I was not happy with this hotel at first because when we went to check in they said they had overbooked & needed to send us to another hotel about 8 miles from them. I really wanted to get to explore Chicago that night but instead had to settle on Skokie, IL. They paid for our cab fare to the other hotel & then back to them the next day. The hotel was nice. Bigger room than I thought it would be. Bar was okay. Breakfast was good but pricey. Tiny refrigerator that was a mini bar & there wasn't any room to store stuff. Only 2 small nightstand drawers for clothing storage & we were staying 5 nights. Didn't like the rainshower head in the shower. Luckily there was also a hand held wand so I could rinse off. We needed to stay an extra night because my husband was sick & they accommodated us because of the mixup the first night. They gave us the same rate we paid initially which was low. We walked everywhere and the location was good. Don't know if I would stay there again because of the overbooking fiasco. Never had that happen to me before."
I am NOT Happy with the Millennium Knickerbocker Hotel at the moment. Myself and two other couples reserved rooms months ago. We received confirmations from Expedia and Hotmail yesterday confirming our reservations. My husband called yesterday to see if we could extend our stay by one night only to find out that our reservations had been cancelled by the hotel. Apparently someone forgot to block off rooms for a large group and they continued booking rooms. SHAME ON YOU - MILLENNIUM KNICKERBOCKER!! So far we do not have confirmed rooms downtown Chicago.
"Had the most enjoyable hotel stay at the Millennium Knickerbocker Hotel Chicago from June 3-5, 2014. This hotel lived up to its hype of being a 4 star hotel with class. Everyone was friendly and Kasey checked us into a corner room. We had a bit of a view but the room with king bed was comfortable and well decorated. We received a free refrigerator and as a part of our ""deal"" with TravelZoo we received not only an inexpensive rate, but free breakfasts (both days) and $25 at the Martini Bar. My husband and I worked out both days we were there and enjoyed the fitness options. The Nix Restaurant served amazing breakfasts from a menu and the wait staff was friendly and attentive. The Martini Bar served excellent martinis; the bartender was friendly, helpful and provided a carafe of munchies to go with our drinks. The Knickerbocker is old school charm and class and very quiet for being located right off of Michigan Ave. I would recommend this hotel to anyone. We will stay here again!

"I stayed at the Knickerbocker in mid-May for a conference; the location was fantastic, right off of the Magnificent Mile and close to all the shopping, nightlife and activities that Chicago offers. The hotel has an old world charm with a classic decor. I would consider upgrading to a larger room, as my standard king was quite small (it was fine this time as I alone, but if my wife was with me I think it would have been a bit cramped). I encountered no issues during my four night stay, and would stay here again."
"I am here to attend an annual oncology conference. The drive from O'Hare international airport is looong. The hotel is a quaint little place located just off North Michigan avenue. Convenient to reach all important areas in the city.The staff are courteous and helpful. The breakfast is just adequate - we are pampered by our luxury Indian hotels and their variety!The rooms are small,so is the bath but bed is comfortable.The lobby has a good bar and is a nice place to while your time away."
"I stayed here for one night. taking advantage of an Amex promotion. I was not disappointed, the beds were large and comfy, room spacious, and heating worked perfectly (we arrived during a snowstorm just after the Polar Vortex!). The bathroom's sliding door was a bit inconvenient, because it had large gaps so you can see whoever is inside (I keep seeing this in many public toilets in the US, what's up with that???). I really like the location, within walking distance to my favorite leathergoods store Frye, and the MagMile shopping street. The building is also beautiful, probably a restored old building. The staff was especially nice and cheerful, we felt very well taken care of. The guy who helped us with our bags was especially friendly.Parking was really expensive, almost as much as the cost of the room."
"We stayed here in July last year. We had actually booked another hotel in Chicago that we didn't realize was so far out of the city. So we booked this one very last minute and we were so glad we did. The staff were amazing, they would remember our names and our drink orders when we would have a couple of wines down at the bar before dinner. The room was good and everything was very clean. We loved it"
"Ever since we stayed here, I have been dying to write about how exceptional this hotel is and I wanted to have the perfect wording, but I don't think there are enough words in the dictionary to showcase how lovely the Knickerbocker is.Every Valentines Day weekend my husband and I follow a tradition... it was our first date 7 years ago on vday and we utterly love this weekend. It is a little getaway for us and lets not forget eating some great Chicago food. Dinner is always at Tavern on Rush (LOVE IT), drinks at whatever bar we like, breakfast at The Original Pancake House (yum) and the Chicago Auto Show. We never stay at the same hotel cause we like to stay all over... however, I think we have found one amazing little gem.We picked the Knickerbocker for two main reasons, price and location. For $100 a night in the city, its a steal. Then, it is within a short walking distance to Tavern. Once we enter the building, we can tell that a wedding is going on and everybody is pre-drinking in the lobby/martini bar. I am instantly jealous, cause not only do I LOVE weddings, but this seems like an amazing hotel to have your wedding at. We check in and the front desk clerk has to be the nicest guy. He asks us if we are celebrating anything, how are commute from the Burg was, if we need a taxi to dinner, etc. Also informs us that the lobby area will clear out in about 30 mins for the wedding.Elevator is small, but its an older hotel, and its not slow, so I'd rather it be small than opposed to slow. On our floor people are pre-drinking in the huge common area for the wedding (once again, jealousy enters my brain). Our room is just perfect and the shower was my favorite part. Pretty big for a hotel shower, rainfall shower head and an additional wand. We get dressed for our night out and visit the Martini bar. The bill is quite high, $30 for two drinks, but this is the city AND there was no skimping on the alcohol. I mean we both walked out feeling a little fuzzy and hungry for dinner.We just loved everything about it... All of the upgrades in the room were great, loved that it was a boutique hotel, the location, the staff, etc.I am sure we will be back next year :)"
"The Knickerbocker hotel was the first 5 star hotel i stayed at by my self, and like Tony the Tiger says it was (Greaaat). I was surprised when i opened a drawer under the tv and saw every condiment u could imagine even a tooth brush. I opened the refrig, and saw those little bottles of licqure, I didn't open them because i don't drink alcohol. I did open some candy which cost $7. Every one says the halls are noisy, not so on the 6th floor, maybe because i was there the 3rd week of February (off season). I needed a comb so the door person told me to go a block away to a 24hr mart, i couldn't find it, so he walked me to it. The shower in the bathroom was a rain forest shower head and a shower wand with 25 water jets both of them u cant change settings, everyone is right, there is a big gap on bottom of door to hallway, lots of light comes in GO BIG KNICKERBOCKER!!!! Thanks from Mitchell Samuels ps. I will b back"
"I had an excellent 5 night stay at The Millennium Knickerbocker. The staff was very professional and friendly, always helpful. One of the outstanding doormen gave us a great tip about taking the train into the airport which saved us about $50. The front desk clerk held our luggage until it was time for check-in so we could wander for a while. The staff here is the example of how hospitality should be. Overall I was very pleased with all aspects of the hotel and it was in walking distance to most places we wanted to visit! We shopped, ate, went sightseeing without having to get a taxi.It also gets my vote for most comfortable beds ever! I seriously have never slept this well on vacation. It was like sleeping on a cloud, I really hated to leave it behind. We now have friends in Chicago that we could stay with but I would not miss the chance to sleep in one of those bed again!"
"Enjoyed my stay here. Though a historic hotel, I found it to be quiet, clean (excellent maid service) and a great value. Elevators worked well which is not always the case at historic hotels. Basic bar, lobby, gym, restaurant (not open for dinner so you will need to venture out but there are numerous options close by on foot). Biggest negative is parking for your vehicle as there is no self park options offered by the hotel. Valet is quite steep at $65 a night, but you do get in/out privileges. If you are looking for upscale amenities, look elsewhere, but if you are looking a good place to relax with easy access to Michigan Ave shopping at an exceptional value this is it!"
"I debated between a 4 and 5 rating. It wasn't quite perfect but it was very good.The service is exceptional. Everyone on the staff was friendly and helpful. I'd like to give an extra mention to Charlie, the doorman, who not only helped us when we needed it, but made us feel extra special.We also took the historical tour of the hotel with Paul which was informative and a pleasure.The hotel is in an excellent location on the north end of the Gold Coast. Plenty of great shopping, dining and site seeing within walking distance, even in the winter.Our room was small but it had recently been renovated and was nice. They have a nice lobby / lounge area which is a great place for a casual drink.Parking is a bit of an issue. The hotel parking is rather expensive. There are other lots nearby where you can even reserve parking. That's expensive too but not quite as bad. Just the price you pay in the big city.Checkout is rather punctual at noon but we stored our bags until 5pm without an issue.This is a great place to go and we look forward to a return trip."
"Man what a place!Here is the breakdown. Service:Awesome, I needed Justin Timberlake tickets printed and didn't have access to a printer. The front desk man (Sam) was great! He told me to send him the tickets in email and printed them. Didn't have to wait. On top of that he was ready to answer questions and even got us a cab when we needed one. If you are the GM of this hotel, Sam should get a raise. We didn't deal with other staff so can't really comment on them. Value:Got a deal on Hotwire and paid like nothing. Great deal. Sleep Quality:Had a huge bed with a comfortable mattress, slept great (even after a few drinks). Cleanliness:This hotel is so clean that a soap bar gets jealous. Location: Well if being a block away from the Hancock Tower and beach isn't for you, I don't know what is. Perfect location!!Rooms:Perfect size, clean, gorgeous bathroom. We had a desk and they even had a computer in our room! Oh not to forget the bar fridge with everything in it. Overall:You will get royal treatment for the price of nothing by staying here. The hotel is older but definitely worth it. I can't wait to comeback in August with my kids :)."
We booked this with Hotwire ...it was clean...staff was helpful and friendly. We wanted a place to relax and enjoy the city...the price was right as were the accommodations. The lobby had a nice bar.... the bartender was attentive and kind. The location is directly across from the Drake...it was a bit further north than I'd planned but worked out quite well nonetheless. I would definitely stay here again.
"My husband and I stayed here on 2/13 for just one night on our very first trip to Chicago. This is a charming and lovely hotel The front desk staff was very nice and actually every employee that we came across was quite friendly and accommodating. The room itself was nice, the computer on the desk to look at local jaunts was a great idea and helpful. The room was clean and the bed very comfortable. The bathroom and shower were also very nice. We sat for a bit in the martini bar and enjoyed the bartender Floyd. He is a funny man who kept us laughing. All in all, we got such a great price on Priceline for this hotel, it seemed like a steal with how nice the hotel actually ended up being. We would stay here again for sure!"

"The Millennium Knickerbocker Hotel Chicago is the perfect place to stay for solo, business, couples or family travelers. This historic hotel has been beautifully updated and maintained.The hotel retains it's charming grander yet is modern. Above all, the staff are professional, helpful, knowledgeable and friendly. I have stayed in this hotel several times within the last 12 months, and again last week when I returned for the Chicago Auto Show.Upon arrival I was met by a doorman at my cab door immediately upon stopping. This was true upon every arrival and departure. I must give special recognition to your front desk representative, Simeon Cunninghamthat handled my arrival and departure. Cunningham was professional, knowledgeable and friendly. Upon my arrival he determined that I has not joined your loyalty program. He explained the program and its benefits to me and on the spot, with my agreement, enrolled me.My checkout by Cunningham was also a pleasurable experience. Housekeeping staff did an excellent job and are to be commended. The hotel and my suite was immaculate.Beds are superior quality as are towels and linens. Large screen TVs were appreciated. Floor to ceiling marble bathrooms are exceptional. I appreciate the fact that the honor snack/drink bar in the rooms are maintained by a person vs electronic charges which are such an annoyance in other hotels. I had breakfast, almost daily, in the lobby restaurant. The food in this restaurant was fresh, hot and very good -the prices were reasonable. With all this said about the restaurant, what made the true difference was the dedicated professional service staff. From the bus staff to the waiters all were attentive on each and every visit.I don't know there names, but I commend each of them. I have eaten in this restaurant on several stays at the hotel. I am pleased to acknowledge that I see the very same workers there on every visit. In the lobby, the bellman always speaks upon arrival or departure. One last item, the lobby bar serves very good drinks and food, again will excellent staff. After staying at most all of the better hotels along the Magnificent Mile I have found my home away from home! Thank you.

"Staff was very kind and offered their opinion's on local restaurants to visit. Room was spacious and big enough for 3 people. Beds and TV were of superior quality. The bathroom was modern and the shower was very unique but a little difficult to handle (I'm an engineer by the way). The workout room was adequate with several ellipticals, treadmills, and free weights. Valet parking was quick and efficient. We asked for a cot and did not receive one, but on the second request it was delivered promptly."
"Two of us ladies stayed here for two days last August 2014. What a wonderful stay! It is located on the north end of Michigan Ave (it's the old Playboy Hotel - across the street from the Drake).  The staff was helpful and very friendly, always asking if we were enjoying our stay. The room was clean and quiet. We even were able to use the mini-fridge without worry of charge just for opening the door (although all the snacks & drinks were available for purchase.) They included a free use computer in the room, but we really didn't need it. Of course they held our luggage for the day once we checked out as we still had things to do. We had upgraded to a Superior Room with two doubles rather than the Standard and well worth it. (I think we paid only an extra $20 per night). Our beds were very comfortable.I love the ""old"" hotels with all their history and 'grandness and details'. Be sure to walk around and check out some of the old ballrooms and knooks & crannies. The only downside is usually smaller rooms, so it pays to upgrade to one a bit larger. Our bathroom was just fine ... clean with plenty of counter space. If you want monitors in your bathroom mirrors and everything brand new and huge, then this hotel is not for you. The hotel is 'comfortably' busy.... nothing too loud, too quiet, too busy. It was just right. We enjoyed the lounge area ...drinks and a quick bite in the evening. We had a package which included breakfast. It was good, although too pricey for me if it hadn't been included as part of the package. Nice crowd ... My ONLY complaint was that the elevators were disgusting (dirty and worn). It was shocking to me as everything else was perfect. Can't someone vacuum and use a bit of Windex? They badly needed painting.This location was great for us. We enjoyed dessert & coffee next door at the top of the Hancock. We enjoyed walking and people watching the Gold Coast in the evening. Enjoyed taking my morning coffee and walking across to the beach and having it all to myself. In the evening this area of Michigan is a bit less touristy and more local which we really enjoyed. We had done plenty of hectic touristy things during the day.I hope to stay again sometime. Clean and comfy old grand hotel in a wonderful location.

"The room was comfortable with a very posh bathroom. The staff were always helpfull. There was a regular piano playing in the reception area which varied from a party atmosphere to a subtle piano bar. Downside was that it was the only place in Chicago where we had to pay for the internet, until we found that we could get on it for free in the reception area.

"We stayed for one night Memorial Day weekend while celebrating an anniversary/birthday. We got a phenomenal rate on Hotels.com. The hotel is ideally located in the heart of the Gold Coast and just steps from the lake. The lobby is quaint and trendy and the rooms are tight, but well-appointed, clean, and comfortable. Despite its location, the hotel room was remarkably quiet. The only negative thing I have to say is that when I check in with the front desk staff by the name of Simeon he was very rude brief and not attentive however at the same time when my girlfriend check in next to me by the front desk agent I didn't quite get her name but she was African American she was very pleasant and professional and explain everything about what we needed to know with a SMILE..I wish I had interact with her because it really did make a Difference!!!"

It was just right. We enjoyed the lounge area ...drinks and a quick bite in the evening. We had a package which included breakfast. It was good, although too pricey for me if it hadn't been included as part of the package. Nice crowd ... My ONLY complaint was that the elevators were disgusting (dirty and worn). It was shocking to me as everything else was perfect. Can't someone vacuum and use a bit of Windex? They badly needed painting.This location was great for us. We enjoyed dessert & coffee next door at the top of the Hancock. We enjoyed walking and people watching the Gold Coast in the evening. Enjoyed taking my morning coffee and walking across to the beach and having it all to myself. In the evening this area of Michigan is a bit less touristy and more local which we really enjoyed. We had done plenty of hectic touristy things during the day.I hope to stay again sometime. Clean and comfy old grand hotel in a wonderful location.


Room Tip: These old hotels generally have small size rooms so pay the extra to upgrade to a Superior Room (vs...

"The room was comfortable with a very posh bathroom. The staff were always helpfull. There was a regular piano playing in the reception area which varied from a party atmosphere to a subtle piano bar. Downside was that it was the only place in Chicago where we had to pay for the internet, until we found that we could get on it for free in the reception area.


Room Tip: Go for a lower floor as the lifts get busy during peak times

"We stayed for one night Memorial Day weekend while celebrating an anniversary/birthday. We got a phenomenal rate on Hotels.com. The hotel is ideally located in the heart of the Gold Coast and just steps from the lake. The lobby is quaint and trendy and the rooms are tight, but well-appointed, clean, and comfortable. Despite its location, the hotel room was remarkably quiet. The only negative thing I have to say is that when I check in with the front desk staff by the name of Simeon he was very rude brief and not attentive however at the same time when my girlfriend check in next to me by the front desk agent I didn't quite get her name but she was African American she was very pleasant and professional and explain everything about what we needed to know with a SMILE..I wish I had interact with her because it really did make a Difference!!!"

"A beautiful hotel. Great location, and lovely decor. Friendly and professional staff, very knowledgeable and effecient. Most memorably, a snafu arose after asking their concierge to book a tour. The snafu was perhaps due to my not being more clear, but they took responsibility. They not only verbally apologized, they followed up by sending chocolate strawberrys and champagne with a handwritten apology note. I was truly blown away and I travel often. This level of commitment to customer service was far beyond what I have come to expect. I will definitely stay at the Knickerbocker again the next time I'm in Chicago.

"The property is nice, the breakfast buffet is fantastic and the staff is amazing. Every person we came in contact was so very accommodating and pleasant. Demetrius our concierge knows his city, he prides himself on giving the very best service possible. He introduced us to Francios over at the front desk, he too was wonderful. The doormen, housekeeping, all the staff in breakfast area treat you as if you are the only patron staying there. Yes, the property is nice but there are many nice places to stay in Chicago. The staff makes this place The Place To Stay.

"This hotel is in a great location in Chicago, about a mile or so from Soldier Field. It is near lake Michigan. Within walking distance is the Trump Building and the Chicago Tribune Building. there are plenty of affordable restaurants and bar within walking distance. the hotel is about a 20 minute cab ride from Midway Airport.The Chicago River is on the rear of the property, great view! Get up high as possible.

"Located on the Chicago River with many rooms having a view of part of the City's spectacular skyline, I found no fault with any aspect of our stay in this large and handsomely appointed hotel.Sheraton has a two-tier guest system. Depending on which one you are, you will have to pay extra charges for such things as complete wi-fi access, bottled water (although they did give you one small bottle gratis per night), etc.


Room Tip: Ask for a room with a southern view of the River, Trump Tower, etc.

"Stayed here for two nights during a business conference. Registered as a Starwood preferred guest on arrival and was therefore upgraded to a room on the 30th floor. This was a good size, clean and well decorated. Bathroom slightly dated with no separate power shower just a handheld head over the bath. My room had a connecting door to the neighbouring room which contained a very noisy guest. Avoid these if you want peace and quiet. I did not eat in the hotel apart from during the breaks in the conference. The food and coffee were pretty mediocre by European standards. I had a fantastic view from my room over the Chicago River and downtown. The hotel is well located and a short walk to the magic mile and with easy access to the riverside walk. Staff were polite and helpful. A good place to stay in Chicago."
"Not sure why this place thinks they deserve to be called ""one of the finest hotels in Chicago."" I've traveled extensively, and come to find that my overall impression of a hotel really boils down to the details. The rooms were dated (which is okay), but they were also dirty (not okay). The staff were friendly (great!), but clearly there were not enough of them.There were many things which indicated they were doing the best they could under less than ideal management.There was ALWAYS a long line at the front desk. One evening my key card stopped working, and I waited in line for over 20 minutes to get a replacement. Why on earth would you only staff the front desk for such a large hotel with one person, on a Saturday night?! When I finally made it to the desk. I was asked about my room. I replied that I was less than pleased with the cleanliness, and they offered to move me to another room or provide extra reward points. None of these were very appealing options after a long day, and the room never got any cleaner over the next few days. I was there for a conference, and I guess that the hotel had another event scheduled to start immediately after. While our meetings were still in progress, hotel staff began tearing down vendor equipment and setting up for the next event. This was done without notice, and again - the conference was still in progress as scheduled! Not only was the noise disruptive to the meeting, but several very expensive displays were damaged or destroyed when they were hastily placed on the floor by hotel staff. If you're thinking of scheduling a conference at this hotel, look elsewhere!"
"I stayed at this hotel for a conference at the navy pier - overall good location, nice room, good amenities. The thing that stood out for me was Suzanne at the concierge desk. Suzanne helped make my stay memorable. She was super helpful in booking tickets to see The Second City, which was amazing ""a must see"", she gave me information on how to get half price show tickets to the musical ""Million Dollar Quartet"", gave me some recommendations for places to grab a quick snack before the show, arranged for a late check out to accommodate my conference schedule and flight. She truly went above and beyond. If I could only have someone like her to help coordinate my day to day life! A great trip to Chicago!"
"Recently, my husband and I spent a few days here when visiting our daughter and son-in -law. We had access to the Club Lounge which was great for having breakfast there each morning, Their service and food were sufficient to get your day off to a good start. The views are nice as well from the lounge. Our room was very clean and comfortable bed. The location is great to getting on the main roads by car. It is in walking distance to movie theater. Lots of restaurants are close by and in easy walking distance to get the bridge and take the Architecture boat cruise, see the Wrigley bldg, State Street and lots of other interesting places to visit. We have stayed here several times and are always very happy here with their customer service. The only thing I would say is, if you don't have to have a car to park there don't, as the parking rate is very high as I am sure it is at most hotels."
"The staff and hotel were exceptional. Our trip was made exceptional after meeting the most wonderful and helpful concierge person the four of us ever met. Suzanne was a delight to speak to and deal with on a daily basis. The hotel was a 10 plus but Suzanne made it that much more spectacular. My wife and friends will definitely be back to this hotel. Thank you so much Suzanne

"The Sheraton Chicago Hotel and Towers is situated close to Michigan Ave, the main shopping area of the city. You can walk to Navy Pier, to take in a speed boat ride on Lake Michigan, ride the Ferris wheel to get a bird's eye view of the city, walk to Millennium Park, museums and many other attractions.The hotel is situated on the bank of the Chicago River. You can walk to an awesome architectural boat tour, rent bikes to ride along the coast or go shopping on the Magnifient Mile.The hotel hots Shula's Steak House and has some casual food on the lower level. Ask for one of the newly renovated rooms.

"We were here in a conference and didn't spend a ton a of time in the hotel, but the rooms were nice and clean. The staff was very friendly which is more than I can say for some other properties we have stayed at in the past. My only complaint is that there isn't a fridge in the room & the ice bucket was too small to chill anything, much less a bottle of wine. Now this said, you could order a fridge for an additional $25 a day and that just wasn't worth it. Overall I would stay here again. The location was perfect, beautiful views and close to shopping, restaurants etc."
"Overall this is a very nice place, walking distance to many things and located right on the river. Its not in the heart of Michigan Ave, but a block or two away.Had many meetings there, the meetings are prepped very well with goof food and good snacks, good AV equipment. They have a coffee shop and other choices, not bad at all. The rooms are ok, bathrooms not great, outdated and need a facelift. Bed is good, pillows are too flat. Overall not bad, good price being in Chicago. Back every year for this meeting.

"this is the 5th hotel downtown we have stayed in over the past 6 years. The pool was wonderful - short, but could swim laps and wide enough that kids can play on one side while swimming laps. The location is excellent - walk to everything, and reasonably close to the L. Safe as can be. It seemed a bit bland when we checked in, but as the days went by we liked it more and more - the decor grows on you, its more subtle than many. Sitting on the river is very pleasant, and the view is wonderful. Wish they had refrigerators in the room, and bought a bottle of wine rather than buy a drink in the bar again, ($15! for a glass of wine) But really liked the experience.


Room Tip: I got free wifi at check in, which took tech support to setup but was then really fast.

This hotel has excellent staff. The rooms are clean and the bed was so comfortable I wanted to take it home with me :). I definitely recommend staying at this hotel you will not regretted. I want to give a special thank you to the bar and the nice professional bartender that prepared my French gimlet drinks I was happy that he knew how to make and he made it really good. I been to many places and they don't know to make the this drink and make it good
"Great location is why we booked this Sheraton for 2 nights, as it is centrally located in the city of Chicago. We paid over $340 a night with the AARP discount. The room was spacious and comfortable. The complimentary bath products were tiny & not replenished for the second night. Room service promised the breakfast order in less than 30 minutes, but it took 45 minutes to arrive and they forgot to send coffee as ordered."
"Poor service at check-in. Eventually Put us in a room without a view. Not allowed to use the minifridge. For our own stuff, so had to rent another fridge. Had to pay a lot for Internet. Lousy reception ... TV signal broke up repeatedly.slow internet connection. Ended up having to leave room to watch playoff game. Poor conectivityAt professional meeting in building. Snack bar was only option available for food when we arrived and was poor quality and expensive. Location is isolated...not much retail nearby.Staff didn't care when we voiced our dissatisfaction. But, the bed was very comfortable!

"In town for a conference, so it was great to be right in the heart of downtown, able to make the most of my free time. Being walking distance to the Art Institute of Chicago was wonderful. A shout out to concierge Demetrius Kidd, who was a pleasure to deal with and took the time to make sure I selected the right restaurant for my colleagues and me, get us a table when the restaurant was booked, and even tried to get us a window table. And the front desk readily allowed me to change rooms when I was bothered by the elevator noise.


Room Tip: Nice views of the Chicago skyline from upper floors.

"I stayed here for 4 nights for a business conference. Staff was incredibly friendly - from Rory at the front desk who checked me in (friendly, funny, and acknowledged I was a preferred hotel member) to Dianne, our waitress in the bar/lounge area. Even as I was checking out, the staff was busy checking in the next round of conference attendees - continually with a smile on their faces. I loved having a 5 minute walk to Michigan Avenue. Hotel is in a nice location on the river, but not on a super busy road, so it was easy to walk around the area. I was here for business, but would definitely stay her for pleasure. I did not experience any issues with the WiFi either on my phone on my laptop in the room. Great job staff!"
"Stayed at the Sheraton for a large conference. I also stayed at the same hotel about 6 months ago. The hotel is nice and the service is responsive. In fact, I think it may have improved sine my last visit.Unfortunately, the WiFi connection was the worst I have experienced at any hotel that claims it is a business-friendly hotel. My apple device was fine, but I had numerous problems with my Dell. Ironically, some IT support people at the Sheraton informed me that Apple devices had the problems logging on. The problem I had was in my room and not in the conference area. I had to make numerous calls regarding initial connectivity and inability to access initial webpages. I also would get kicked off as well. The issues appeared to be idiosyncratic and unpredictable. If you are business traveler of considering a conference, you must have assurances that attendees will have access to highest performing available service if Wifi access is important during your stay,

"Stayed for 5 nights at the Sheraton with my wife, which is right on the Chicago river and close to all amenities. Despite the hotel being extremely busy during our stay due to an Educational conference, the staff were attentive and the hotel very clean. The continental breakfast in the Club lounge was adequate but could have some more variety. The bed was very comfortable and the room had all that was required. We were on the top floor (34) with panoramic views over the city and river. If I am ever in Chicago again I will stay in this hotel.


Room Tip: Club rooms are all on the top three floors with excellent views.

We came to Chicago to attend the performance of a coffin in Egypt at Chicago Opera Theatre. Brilliant performance by the way. The service at the Sheraton is really great. Reception desk was friendly and very responsive to the fact that I have been misled by the website about the availability of free Wi-Fi due to using an AARP rate. The reception clerk was really smart and afforded me the free Wi-Fi. Big points. The room was quite lovely. With very nice modern art work.two small problems a toilet which didn't stop running. And a very loud heating and cooling fan. Would stay here again in a second.
"The Sheraton Towers is an excellent location for downtown Chicago and close to the conference center,The hotel has good facilities including a good steakhouse restaurant.My room was comfortable although it could use a face lift. The closet was small and the dusty from the ceiling tiles.Plenty of work space and power outlets and the wifi was fast and worked well. Mine was included in the room price.Overall a good hotel I would recommend and stay at again.

"I did quite a bit of research for this short family getaway. I chose this property based on location, reviews and price. I found a great rate for a club level room. I checked on the parking situation and had read that some reviewers arrived and found the self parking full. We really did not want to use valet, and I found the Ogden garage online for a very reasonable $29 per night prepaid. There is an underground walkway right to the hotel.Our room was on the 34th floor and viewed the river facing west. It was clean and well furnished but a bit small for our family of 3. When running water in our sink (or when the neighbors did) it sounded like it was rushing over Niagara Falls! We did also hear people talking in the hallway. They were not being loud, but there just isn't much noise isolation. The club lounge was nice and offered breakfast, evening snacks and soda or bottle water.*** OK, this one gets a star because it is important. The in-room (mini bar) food is placed on a sensor and if moved goes on your bill. Yep, we knocked over a $15 jar of cashews when placing a carry on bag on the counter area and it went on the bill. Fortunately I was reviewing the information provided in the binder and found details about how the system works. A quick call to the front desk and the charged was removed. However, I think this entire system is unacceptable and would be a complete nightmare for anyone with young children. The concierge staff was very helpful, and all employees were very polite and helpful. The location is very good. Wi Fi is included for club level or SPG members who book online. It covers up to 3 devices."
"Just returned from a 4 night stay for business. This hotel is conveniently located within walking distance to the Magnificent Mile, Lake Shore Drive and the Navy Pier. Getting around was no problem as the front door staff are helpful when it comes to getting cabs. The hotel gym was good with a nice view of the city. All of the equipment was clean and maintained in working order. The overall appearance of the hotel was nice and the rooms were well appointed. There was a business center located within the hotel as well. We had one minor issue with the heating/air conditioning. However, one call to the front desk and 5 minutes later a building engineer was up to fix it. Overall, we would definitely stay here again while visiting Chicago."
"I stayed here over a weekend with friends. Our room had an amazing view of Lake Shore Drive & Navy Pier. Walkable distance to Navy Pier and just around a $5.25 cab ride to Willis (formerly Sears) Tower. Also a short cab ride away from some great nightlife spots. The restaurant/bars at the hotel are expensive, but that is to be expected of the Chicago area. This hotel is in a great location; close to many tourist spots & shopping. Definitely recommend it!"
"Hotel is located where the rest of the hotels are in the Loop, walking distance to Magnificient Mile. We booked two rooms at Club Level, but disappointed with the breakfast offered there. Furthermore, people forget that hotel is for sleeping not partying. 5 people in 3401 made such a noise at night security came in even before made complaint. The problem with almost all US hotels is their air conditioning systems in the room, they are so noisy. Furthermore, if you are staying on higher floors, there is fair chance that you will be exposed to main air conditioning units' noises of lower buildings which are located on top of their building. Therefore there is always a noise, Sheraton in this context was not an exception.

"Usually my idea of what service should be from a hotel and what is actually experienced is vastly different. The Sheraton Towers however, really has service that is fantastic. When we arrived, I thought by the crowded lobby full of student athletes and families that I was again going to be put through a convention style stay. But the check in process was quick, friendly and welcoming. The entire place looks, smells and feels new. The rooms are very clean and everything worked correctly. I called to the desk to have the mini bar removed because it is a motion sensored tray which I felt was too tempting for my children. After the first day, I asked for an upgraded room because the current one just was not large enough for our family. Not the hotels fault, it was mine for not booking two rooms. Rory at the customer service desk was so professional and went out of his way to help figure out my problem. He told me to go out and when I returned, everything would be taken care of. Now usually, when I ask for anything at a hotel, I am told the same thing yet disappointed when I return. This was not the case with Rory at the Sheraton. When I returned, he said he valued my gold status as a starwood member and upgraded us to a very nice suite. The service in the Chi bar was attentive and friendly. Housekeeping was very friendly telling us to have a nice stay with our family. When we checked out, Michael was helpful and smiling telling us to remember the Sheraton for a visit in the future. In all, the employees seem to enjoy their job and look for opportunities to assist guests."
"My Fiancee and I stayed over the holiday weekend while she was in town for a Volleyball tournament. Almost all the guests were there for the same tournament, which meant it was filled with teenage girls. Despite this, the rooms were never too loud. The best part of this hotel is the location. It is a half-mile to Navy Pier or the Lakefront Trail for a run or bike ride. It was walking distance to Grant Park, the Bean, and Michigan Avenue shopping. To get to further places like McCormick, we took an Uber, never more than $10. The room was comfortable and clean. The bathroom was updated and functional. The bed was comfortable, though in our double rooms they were a full and not queen. The only complaint was room temperature. I like it cool when I sleep. It was 40s-50s outside and I turned the thermostat down to 66 (the lowest), but the room would still get warm overnight."
"This is my 4th stay at the Sheraton Towers and always enjoyed it. However, Id never used the Club Lounge before. What a pleasant surprise. Lounge is beautiful-as you'd expect. But, what makes it great is the hostess Connie, who is so friendly and attentive...she kept everyone smiling (young kids, adults, solo travelers like myself). Imagine going to a beautiful upscale home for a gathering, and the lady of the house is a joy...making you feel like the home is yours. Truly a great experience. I recall her going around telling people what was coming out and when, just like one would do hosting a gathering of friends at home! Just cant say enough. Kudos to hotel mgmt. for matching this great hostess with such a lovely lounge...icing on the cake!

"Before retiring, I often stayed in this hotel on business. It always was a pleasant experience. Since that was more than ten years ago, we were very happy to find that it had not declined in any way. Our room had obviously been recently refurbished and was in excellent condition. Although we had booked it for a very reasonable price, we were pleased to find that it was a corner room with lots of space and a couch and easy chair.Most outstanding was the staff; from the front desk clerk to the maid who showed me where the ice machine was, every staff member we met was courteous, pleasant and anxious to help us. What a pleasure.Located close to the loop and to N. Michigan Ave, this is a perfect place to sat in downtown Chicago.

"The Sherston Chicago Hotel and Towers is nice hotel in a great downtow location. The hotel is near Michigan Avenue, River Nirth, Navy Pier and Grant Park giving a visitor easy access to shopping, restaraunts, attractions and museums. My wife and I have been frequent visitors over the last 15 years and have always been treated well by everyone at the hotel. For location and price, it is a good value. The rooms are nicely furnished and even the ""base"" rooms are decent size. The hotel has river, city and lake views and any of the three are good on sunny days and clear nights (although the river view towards Trump Hotel is a recommended favorite). Shula's Steakhouse is a high quality restaurant for a special dinner out. We always look forward to our visits."
"LOCATION wise, I found it to be perfect for what we wanted to see/do in the city (typical first time visit-Bean, Museum Campus, Wrigley, Navy Pier). Really only walkable to Bean/Navy Pier, but Uber was easy and cabs were plenty. It was a holiday and I had no patience with holiday el schedules with only 24 hours in the city. The Westins are better placed, but not to the tune of $100 better for the night.PRICE/ROOM, as I mentioned it was $109. No brainer for the location and even with $61 valet (on site self park is $51), it's more than reasonable. We had a north-facing view on the 25th floor that had a peekaboo view of the Lake, which was nice. Typical Sheraton amenities/beds and very comfortable. Only quibble was minor. It's a safe bet that if two doubles are booked, it's two people staying. One washcloth and hand towel, really? When I found the maid and got one she said that's standard ""as it's a business hotel"". That makes no sense, but whatever. Notes: the gift shop referenced on their site/in the books in the room doesn't exist. It's possible that they may build one out but there's none there now and staff couldn't tell me when it was last open. Not a huge issue as there's a CVS in the Radisson right across the Columbus Ave. Bridge. Maybe 5m walk. About 5-10m walk is the Aon Center whose basement has Starbucks, Dunkin', Au Bon Pain, etc. which are good for breakfast if you don't have lounge access/want hotel food. We did room service as there wasn't much open for easter dinner having cut off service at a late brunch.

"Good location - right on the Chicago river, great spot for watching the river being dyed green. Close - walking distance to the navy pier, shopping, etc. The staff were very helpful and housekeeping was spot on. I had a king room on the 32nd floor. The view was okay, just a peek at the water. Would definitely encourage you to look at the 33rd floor looking at the river. We opted to include the club lounge. Breakfast was pretty standard, but the h'ors de oeuvres from 5-7 were a very nice bonus."
"We stayed at the Sheraton Hotel and Towers over the Easter Holiday weekend. The staff there was excellent. Our double bed Club level room was wonderful. I would like to particularly mention the staff at the ""Club"" area. If you stay in a Club level room you have access to this room where they complimentary serve continental breakfast and nightly light appetizers. You can also purchase drinks as well. Connie Alex was there Sunday night and was so nice, accommodating and just overall wonderful. We would definitely stay there again and in another club level room."
"While the hotel itself is quite nice, what really stands out at the Sheraton is the staff. At a very large (>1000 rooms) hotel, I often see fairly impersonal service or feel like I'm treated just like one of the many. Not so at the Sheraton Chicago. I arrived VERY early in the day (approximately 8:30AM) and went to the desk hoping to store my luggage until I could check in later. To my surprise, the very friendly front desk woman was able to put me in a room immediately. She even asked several questions so she could find the right room. I had reserved a king room, and she could accomodate that but only on a low floor, and offered a room on the top floor with two doubles--to complement the gorgeous club lounge access she also provided me. The next day when I checked out, I checked out with the same very friendly young woman who commented that I had just arrived and was already leaving! She told me ""it was nice to meet you""--and I really believed she was sincere! The luggage storage was very easy as well and the woman who retrieved my luggage for me was also very genuine in that she hoped I had a great stay. I travel to Chicago a LOT for work, and I will always look to stay at the Sheraton towers when I am able to."
"This was our family's fourth stay at this hotel. It is rare to get the combination of incredible location, clean, renovated rooms, luxurious ambiance in the lobby, excellent customer service by happy employees (door men, front desk, house keeping staff, parking attendants) who were all eager to help. Fast elevators despite many, many people staying there for a conference. Renovated...

"Had the opportunity to stay here while in the city for a conference. Amenities are top quality. Pool and gym were amazing. Four of us were in different rooms on different floors in different areas of the hotel but every one of us had an amazing view. The bed is crazy comfortable, water pressure perfect and the desk area spacious enough for me to spread my work out. I had concerns about internet speed from other reviews but that was never an issue. Located right on the river and withing walking distance of everything we wanted to see and do!"
I am a life imePlatium member. I drove up in my rented automobile and from the moment I arrived at the doortestaffould to have been more accommodating and pleasant. I was greated by the doorman as if I was the most important person he had greeted that day. The valet service was excellent though a little expensive. I moved on to the front desk and the young woman who worked with me did everything possible to help me with the best available room on a high floor. The Club Lounge was staffed by the most friendly people a well. I would recommend this property in a second to any of my friends.
"In town for a week for a conference at McCormick. This hotel provided me all the support I needed for a busy conference schedule and precious little time to discover Chicago. The front desk and concierge staff were positive, efficient and helpful. Suggestions for restaurants and activities matched my descriptions of how much time I had and what I hoped to do exactly.The room was well kept and had a great view of the city. The pillows were phenomenal (seriously). Very comfortable room with all I needed.I will look this place up as a first choice the next time I am in town. Great location, great hotel.

"I stayed two nights for business. Check in is efficient, the location is very nice. Had a room with a view of the Navy Pier, the bed was comfortable, room was reasonable, location is very good. It's just that, for a Sheraton, you kind of expect a bit more in terms of room quality and hotel upkeep. The room is pretty dark, there was no overhead lighting, just two lamps and a desk lamp (one light over the doorway). And one thing that struck me, and this hotel is not alone here, but it was very apparent here: Food trays left in the hall. After people finish their room service meals, they put the tray out in the hall ... in this case, there was a tray out when I checked in, and it was still there late the next morning. And there were several throughout the day. Can't imagine it would cost much to hire a person to make the rounds on each floor with a cart and retrieve the trays, they make the hallways smell of burgers and food. There's nothing to hate about this hotel, but a big city Sheraton can do better than this.

Unfortunately I was there in the winter bit I am sure that in the summer I would have enjoyed this hotel a lot more. The billing department had an error on my bill which somehow my rental car was charged twice for parking. It was supposed to be in and out privileges for $49.00 per day which I didnt even use but they credited me back within 48 hours.  The only drawback was my late arrival left me very few food options after 11:00 local time.

A very nice desk clerk, Nia, chose a conference room for me with a beautiful view of the city. My stay was even more enjoyable because I had a clear view of the dyeing of the river for St. Patruck's Day. The concierge suggested excellent restaurants and sites to see based on my interests. The room was quiet and comfortable, and all staff members were friendly and efficient. For an enjoyable stay in Chicago, I highly recommend the Sheraton."
"Everything was great, and it gets even better when you request their assistance to enjoy the region. All the people in concierge are very kind and dedicated, but if you have the chance to talk to Marisa, your experience will not be comparable to anything you ever had. She is able to capture your expectations and point the exact places that will perfectly fit for you, a short stay in Chicago become na amazing experience. Congratulations to the hotel!! And those who are not sure where to stay, trust me, this is the right place (location, view, facilities and service).

"This hotel is easily accessible from Midway Airport and conveniently located near shopping and Chicago landmarks--walkable, or easy by cab. From our arrival with assistance from Amsale Kassa at the reception desk to an initial interaction with a housingkeeping staff member in the hall, everything has extremely well coordinated. I arrived for a conference with student participants, and all spoke of how easily we got started for an honorary society conference. The furnishing of rooms was modern in style with an excellent desk lamp and other lighting, excellent tv, and convenient full length mirror. I travel regularly to conferences in Marriott, Hilton and Hyatt hotels, and find this Sheraton comparable and staff extraordinarily cooperative"
"I called early to see if I could get an early check in and they were very quick to say they could accommodate my request! Upon arrival, I was given an upgrade to a beautiful room on the 28th floor with the most gorgeous view of the city, the river, and the lake. It was very apparent that they were concerned that our stay was wonderful. I will definitely stay there again! :) ONLY downside is that there isn't a hot tub, but that's not a huge deal.

"The Sheraton was very busy with a large convention. The staff that I had an opportunity to interact with were all very friendly and accommodating. I requested a high floor room and was assigned to the 30th floor. Great view! I could see the lake, the river and many buildings surrounding the hotel. A lot of shopping and restaurants nearby. Several restaurants in the hotel as well. The rooms were clean and spacious, the staff was friendly and service was great. I would definitely stay here again."
"I have stayed at the Sheraton twice now during my visits to Chicago and both visits have been a pleasure due to the atmosphere and hospitality of the staff. You are greeted with a smile and service the second you pull up; (despite the frigid temps; as both trips were in February). The front desk staff are just as ""bubbily"" and willing to accommodate you anyway they can! When you are ready to leave the hotel to go shopping, site seeing, etc; they ""whistle for the cab"" shows up right a away to head to your destination. Very efficient service! I lack patience much of the time, and they serve you well here from door to room! The Sheraton has a business feel to it as for those who stay here, but caters to all. Bar service is good, but when they get packed tend to wait a little for service. I'm not that big into pools, but if you are it is small, but warm in there so was great while I watched my daughters swim. Nice gym. I have not eaten there so can not tell you much about that, I did get coffee several times from the coffee shop; it is expensive (I think I can get real Starbucks cheaper; but you're in Chicago and at a hotel)......Overall great experience and CLEAN rooms!"
"I'll start by mentioning the good things - location was definitely great, I was able to check in early and the staff was attentive and efficient. Having said that, there were a couple of things that put me off. One, when I entered my room and was about to get in to bed, there was a hair right in front of me. Then, when I looked closely at the bed cover, there were little hairs on it too. This really put me off. Second, I fell a little sick the next day and needed a pain killer/fever reducer. The property didn't have anything. I had to ask a friend to come to the city with some medicine. I would expect a hotel of this standard to have a first aid kit as well as some basic medication at the property. I thought this hotel was very average and didn't live up to the Sheraton brand in my opinion."
"We are from the suburs and we love spend weekends at the city. we always stay here because its a wonderful resort and a great location. Navy Peir within a few blocks, Movies within a block. and local pub bar next to it!! ohh and River is and the view is priceless. The pool is pretty good and the Gym is great with showers and lockers.

I have stayed here every year for five years for an annual convention in Chicago. The location is perfect walking distance to miracle mile to Navy pier and even the beachfront and aquarium if you're ambitious. The facility is huge and the rooms are very nice especially if you get upgraded to a suite. Shula's restaurant in the lobby is excellent and they have a very large bar for socializing after work. There's nothing spectacular about the hotel but you will get consistently good service a nice room and close to everything.
"What an indulgent weekend! The staff and customer service were unbelievable! I am new to staying in such lovely environments--and to have doormen, bellhops, taxi service! Loved the destination advice and the little things! The Sheraton was SOOO convenient to places of interest--Magnificent Mile, Navy Pier, we took a taxi to the Red Line/Subway start at Grand and went to Chinatown with no hassle! The girls were able to catch a taxi from the hotel to The Bean and tour the park. SO easy to get everywhere, and all we had to do was ask the Concierge or the doormen! Check in was a breeze, the view from our room showed the Lake and the River, as well as the square outside the hotel. The only downside was the cost of parking for the two nights--there isnt a discount for being a hotel guest (at ANY of the hotels on the square).

"My cousin and I visited this hotel on a Girl's Trip. It was great. Can't beat the location. It's close to the Magnificent Mile, the Chicago River Architecture Cruise and it's accessible to transit (which we took to Wrigley Field). Also was walking distance to many great restaurants. Only fault was that wifi was only in the common areas, not the rooms. Overall, this was a great spot to stay in Chi Town."
"Very close to the Must See Chicago Spots! Rooms were modern and clean. This hotel is very very big. Make sure you ask for a hotel room away from the elevator. Stop in the lounge for appetizers and cocktails, great views from up there.Great restaurants and bars within walking distance. There is a lot of construction going on so be careful walking at night.


Room Tip: High Level, Ask for the East Tower facing Navy Pier.

"Stayed here at start of January after the Holiday season. Good Points: The hotel is conveniently located and the view from our room was stunning. We got an upgrade because it was a very quiet time for the hotel. The room was very good, no complaints at all. Bed was comfortable. The staff were very helpful.Bad Points: Wi-Fi is quite expensive. Also, the hotel bar closed early-ish (about 11pm) when we were there so we couldn't get a drink after we came back from dinner on a couple of occasions. I thought this was quite unusual for a hotel of this size, although it may be an American thing as I am from the UK."
"We ventured into the Sheraton during the Cubs Convention, taking a deep breath and expecting barely controlled chaos. What we got instead was a very strong performance by a well prepared staff from the restaurants, to the housekeepers and the front desk. With a huge migration of non-guests in the hotel for the weekend, one might expect curt exchanges and abrupt service. None of that came to pass as the hotel handled the rush with aplomb and good humor, the food in the various venues was quite good, served timely and the waitstaff was friendly and efficient. The front desk answered our questions, directed us accurately in workings of the event and checked us out quickly. Bell and door staff were efficient and knowledgeable as well. All in all, what we feared -- headaches -- did not materialize. Instead we had a great time, with a great experience. We have stayed at the 5-stars on near the Water Tower. While not quite that high end, this is a well run, friendly and efficient hotel and a great alternative to the $$$ others."
"I have stayed at this hotel a couple of different times with my Girlfriend, was the first time I brought my kids here, was our ""Christmas"" trip. Overall was a very pleasant experience. I love the hotel bar, not the prices though. The atmosphere is wonderful, can sit and have a cocktail while you look out toward the river, very peaceful and serene. Room was very tight for the 4 of us, but worked fine as we only stayed one day. Staff is always great here, never an issue. As other reviews have mentioned, prices for the restaurants and room service are extremely high, make sure to read the fine print if you are going to order room service, 18% added with a $3.75 delivery, price you pay for convenience I suppose. I will definitely stay here again. Staff and location are unbeatable."
"I've been a frequent traveler for the prior three years and have logged well over 100 nights per annum. The Sheraton Chicago Hotel and Towers is a favorite destination in Chicago. The hotel excels on a number of fronts: - Prime location in River North and walkable access to the Loop- Great and spacious rooms, available at competitive rates- Excellent staff that are experienced with dealing with frequent and vacation travelers- Fitness room with 12+ cardio machines, free weights and enough spaces to not feel crampedIf you're an SPG member, the benefits of membership become apparent when you're at the hotel including free amenities, tolietries, recognition of status, and an excellent club lounge experience. I hope this helps!

"The hotel is beautifully decorated with great views of the Chicago River, the city, and the Navy Pier in the distance. The rooms are comfortable and roomy.There are several restaurants nearby within walking distance and several inside the hotel itself.I would give the hotel 5 stars if they had vending machines available. There are ice machines, but the only vending machines in the building are behind closed doors for their employees. If you want a snack or soda you can purchase them from the mini bar in your room at extravagant prices, or in the cafe' downstairs, for a little cheaper. While there are computers and printers available in the cafe' as well as free wifi, if you want wifi in your room you will have to pay $14-$19 per night.The staff were extremely helpful and friendly. After a day of checking all souvenir shops for an item without luck, the concierge, Demetrius pointed us in the correct direction. Another concierge took care of exchanging our Amtrak tickets for an earlier time. Overall, it was a great stay."
Upon arriving the property was clean and beautiful. The front desk was very nice and even upgraded us to the club level since we were there to celebrate our 10th wedding anniversary. Our room had a beautiful view of the river and the lake. We were so happy and comfortable. They are one block off of Michigan Ave on the river so everything was right near by. My wife and I highly recommend staying here.
"I stayed at this Sheraton for 4 nights (would have been 3 but for the blizzard) during a conference. Overall it was an excellent experience, and I'd certainly stay here again when in Chicago. The 2 standout aspects included the customer service, particularly registration desk staff (Alexandra) who kindly and efficiently fixed an error I'd made in registration, and the gentleman at the registration desk (sorry did not get name) who extended my stay with no hassles when I had to deal with a plane cancellation. I even got to keep my room, which was the other standout aspect. If a room is available in the east side of the hotel, at the end of the hall, take it! Magnificent views of the river and Lake Michigan, and an interesting wedge-shaped room layout which is a refreshing change from the ordinary box-shaped hotel room. Nothing wrong with the standard rooms, but the end rooms (room numbers end with 50-54, I believe) are lovely. The lobby area was very comfortable, and the fitness center was large and well-equipped. The pool looked nice, though a spa-hot tub would be a welcome addition. Nice locker rooms in the fitness area, including a sauna. This hotel is a ways from the El and not convenient for those who prefer public transportation, but is right on the Riverwalk and a 10-minute walk from Navy Pier, also close to the Magnificent Mile, so a great location from which to sightsee and explore. The experience was short of 5-star; I didn't like the minibar, and mine had a cabinet door that would not stay shut. I had issues with the wifi (though that might have been my computer, at least in part - though I've seen other wifi complaints in the reviews). The bed itself was very comfy but the sheets felt papery and not soft. The furnishings had a few dents and dings here and there. On the other hand, the provision of a bathrobe and the nice toiletry selection were appreciated.Front desk staff offered the option to forgo housekeeping service in return for frequent traveler points or a voucher toward food/services. This was an interesting option and worked out well for me. Housekeeping staff cheerfully restocked my coffee, towels, and toiletries at my request, but I didn't really need to have my bed made each day anyway.All in all, a very nice experience that would just need a couple adjustments to be top-notch. Thank you for a great stay.

I've stayed at this hotel several times for conferences in Chicago. It's a beautiful hotel with a nice indoor pool and large fitness center. Fitness center includes sauna in the locker room. It's a great location (and now just down the street from a Whole Foods--nice if you don't have a huge per diem and want to eat healthy while you're there). The staff is friendly and I'm always pleased with how quiet it is also--something I care a lot about.
"I recently stayed at the Chicago Sheraton and it is a very nice hotel with a great location on the Chicago River. The check in process was easy and the person working at the desk assigned me a wonderful room with extra space and in an extra quiet location at the end of the hall and at the end of an auxiliary small access hall so it was perfect. The rooms have been recently upgraded during in what appeared to be a near total renovation of the rooms with great bedding, linens. The only item which could have been better was eating breakfast in LB because it was expensive and the service was ho hum at best. Larry N

"Room was fine; bed, sheets, comforter, pillows, towels all comfy, fresh & clean. Some wear showing. Peeling veneer on cabinet, etc. Maid service was excellent (except forgetting the liner in the ice bucket one day). What really irritates me is the beverage-stocked fridge that is carefully designed so it's difficult to use for any other purpose and with a PROHIBITION to use for personal items. They'll be happy to rent you a fridge to use if you need one. Good quality TV & iron. Don't know why these nice hotels don't invest in a higher grade TP.Customer service was very good -- Had a couple of erroneous charges on bill and the front desk happily removed them.Used the gym all four mornings.

"I stayed here on business for one night, and was impressed. The real highlights were the friendly staff, the fantastic gym (great views, circuit machines, cold towels) and the great, comfortable room. The coffee bar was a little anonymous and meh, but when you're in a good location like this, it's not a huge deal. I also was annoyed a bit when my card mysteriously demagnetized after a visit to the gym and I had to go to the lobby in my workout clothes. Wasn't the end of the world, and it happens so often with those darn card keys. All in all though--great experience and I would gladly stay here again for business or pleasure. There's a Whole Foods a block away, a movie theater, Walgreens and restaurants. Very pleased with the experience (and wish a storm hadn't forced me to check out a day early!)."
"I recently stayed at this property for a conference I was attending earlier this week. When you step into a premium property, you expect a higher level of service. You also expect to see and feel that premium/luxury experience throughout your stay. This property definitely delivered on providing that experience. The property is well appointed throughout the property from the lobby to your room to the dining rooms. The staff is very friendly and professional. My room offered everything I needed. It was very quiet and had great bedding so I got a good night's rest. All of the food I ate at the conference events was great. I also especially enjoyed eating breakfast the last day in the Hotel restaurant. They made a great omelet and the coffee was great too. The only slight criticism I had was that the High speed Wi-FI internet service was a little spotty at times. Other than that I enjoyed my time there and if I'm ever back in Chicago for another business event/meeting or for fun, I will definitely put this property at the top of my list to return to."
"I stayed with my friend for a long weekend at the Sheraton and they did not disappoint us! This is our 7-8th year staying here, we meet once a year in Chicago to shop, eat and sightsee. We have stayed every year at the Sheraton and would not consider going to any other hotel. Every single person that is employed there goes out of their way to make our visit a wonderful experience. Each time we call housekeeping for extra coffee/creamers/towels/luggage rack, whatever the need is, they immediately bring it to our room! The front desk is very professional yet friendly. We always stop by the concierge desk to ask about attractions or restaurants, Marisa went above and beyond to help us book a tour! She has been there for several years and always so kind and helpful! The rooms are very clean and neat, the beds are so comfortable, I wish I could sneak one in my suitcase to take home! We have already booked our long weekend at the Sheraton for next January 2016!!!! Thank your Sheraton staff for making our stay over the years so special!"
"I've stayed at this hotel for an annual meeting every year since it opened, and I have never been disappointed. The rooms are clean and comfortable, the beds are amazing and the meals they serve for the meetings are always done very well. The meal we always have for the Friday night dinner-dance is always exceptional. Location is perfect, right alongside the river and a five-minute walk to either The Magnificent Mile or Navy Pier, or 15 minutes to Millenium Park.


Room Tip: I always ask for a room with a view of the river.

"I had a very nice stay at this hotel. The hotel was very good about helping people and providing very nice rooms. I would say the only thing that I was slightly disappointed with was the pillows. They could have been more firm. I slept ok, but not because of the bed or noise. I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone staying in Chicago. It is a great location in Chicago. The hotel worked very hard to help people. I did not get to use everything at the hotel because I was there for the convention, but I am confident that anything I needed would have been fulfilled. The rooms were very clean and welcoming. The room was comfortable and quiet in regards to so many people staying for the convention. I would stay at this hotel again for the convention or otherwise if I was going to be in Chicago."
"I stayed at the Sheraton Chicago Towers for two nights as a solo business traveller attending a conference on the property. The hotel has a great location right at the bottom of the Magnificent Mile, with ample shopping, restaurants, and nightlife either a short walk or cab ride away. It's a new building, so everything is comfortable and up-to-date as one would expect of accommodations at this price range, but there isn't much charm or ambience otherwise.Unfortunately, my stay was marred by a series of service issues that added up to a generally disappointing stay. At the check-in counter, I was assigned to an ADA-compliant room without any choice or advice as to what this would mean - I'm not a particularly fussy traveller, but two things I do appreciate on a business trip are ample counter space in the bathroom, and a deep tub. Both of these, of course, were missing from the specialized room.Even worse, the previous occupant had left a takeout container in the minibar fridge - some kind of leftover seafood that had gone bad and started to stink up the room. I was extremely surprised that it hadn't been caught at some point by housekeeping, because it was pretty obvious from the smell that something wasn't right.Since I had a long flight, a late arrival, and early meetings the next morning, I didn't bother trying to complain or switch rooms - I left the trash outside and called it a night. The next morning, my room service breakfast arrived late and cold - I had to leave most of it behind to make my first appointment.I don't expect much charm, ambience, or romance from a city hotel that clearly caters to the business and convention trade - but at this price, these properties should be immaculate and run like clockwork. This clearly wasn't the case during my stay, hence the negative review.


Room Tip: Don't get an ADA-compliant room if you value your bathtub and counter space.

"Attended the Illinois State Bar Association again this year at the Sheraton, our traditional location for this meeting. This takes place during the second weekend in December, beginning on Thursday. I arrived late Friday afternoon for a meeting on Saturday morning. The hotel is always decorated for Christmas by this time and it is always done tastefully and in a way that gives you a warm, cozy feeling. The service at the front desk was prompt and pleasant, despite the large crowd. The room was somewhat small but elegant and comfortable. Two people can stay there comfortably, as long as they don't spend a lot of time in the room. The view from the higher floors is spectacular. The meeting rooms are also comfortable and well maintained. I always look forward to staying at the Sheraton and have not been disappointed yet.

The food was great downstairs and the service was excellent. I would come again. Room was very clean and neat and the mattress and bedding was pretty new as it was really quite comfy. Only downside, no free wi fi. Most hotels offer that now.

"Stayed here for the 2015 Cubs Convention. The location is fantastic. The parking situation is expensive ($51 per night) but there are slightly cheaper options within walking distance. Biggest issue was the noise. Thin walls. We could clearly hear the people in the adjacent room talking at normal volume. Everytime someone flushed a toilet or turned on a faucet above us or adjacent to us, you could hear it very loudly in our room. Other issue was the mini bar -- there's a fridge in the room but it's stocked with over-priced items. If you take any of the items out to put in your own soda, etc to keep it cold -- the sensor will go off and you'll be charged for those items. They took them off our bill, but it was still a hassle. Also, no free wi-fi in the room. For the $220+ per night I paid, I'm thinking free wi-fi isn't too much to ask for. Bar was expensive -- $31 but two shots. Rooms are nothing special, but beds were comfortable and they had good pay per view options."
"I had several problems with this hotel for their convention amenities.1. During the opening ceremonies, they had a lot of people all trying to get in an area that had limited access/exit. Safety wise this was at worst dangerous, at the least, illegal and a fire hazard. Had there been an emergency there was no way the staff could have cleared the room safely.2. The hotel does not have the layout to handle the 7,000 guests much less the vendors that also accompany the convention."
"Wonderfully located on the Chicago River in a walk-to-everything location, The Sheraton is a well appointed hotel with all the amenities one could want in a quality hotel. Good restaurants and bars in the hotel, but many, many more right outside the door. Our room on the 26th floor had a wonderful view of the city. Clean, great bedding, great value!

"This visit was just as good as the last and maybe even a bit better. Our greeting by the front desk was warm & inviting. It set the tone for the next 3 days. I highly recommend this property. If you have the opportunity to book the Club Level rooms, you will be thankful that you did. The Club Lounge breakfast is great and the ability to get soda and water 24/7 is a nice feature. The complimentary wifi on this level is another great feature.The lobby is decorated for the Christmas Season and features a beautiful tree.

"My husband and I are SPG members and we visited this hotel last year and while the property was great, we had some not so welcoming service at one of hotel restraunts. I had emailed the hotel and they took care of everything almost immediatly. When we decided to return, I reached out to one of the directors, Vasileios, who upgraded our room, along with giving us club lounge access along with other accomodations. Let me say, our room was spectacular. We had a suite overlooking the city. There was a lovely bottle of wine with strawberries waiting for us. When we checked in, we were greated by Alexandra Gale who made us feel like we were so very welcome. She was just amazing. We ate at Shulas the first night and Kari provided us fabulous service. They were a little busy, but we also ate around 730pm. We ate breakfast at the Bistro and the food was really good. We were greeted and sat at a table fairly quickly. The service was top notch. The hotel is within walking distance to almost everything. Such an amazing location. My husband and I have stayed at several Sheratons between Florida, Chicago and Michigan and I have to say that the Sheraton in Chicago is our favorite. We cannot wait to come back. We are already planning our return. I refuse to stay anywhere else when we come to the city. The hospitality here is one of a kind. They truely care about their customers."
"We stay here often and are always impressed but tonight we were blown away by two employees in the club level. We just checked in today and are here for a few nights but this review is for the club level service we received dec 20 sat. Jorge, I think F&B manager and Connie Alex were the 2 employees we saw. Starting at 5 the club level was so packed and these 2 seamlessly took care of the hordes people lining up to get the appetizers. Like I said this is our go to hotel and we have never seen so many people at once. We have seen Connie before and she always makes everyone feel welcome. She is a gem to the hotel. We always encounter great employees here but after seeing how they handled this I needed to leave a review for them. I recommend upgrading while at this property always worth it!"
"My professional association, the Illinois State Bar Association, has conducted its annual mid-year meeting for decades at the Sheraton. I've come to know staff from the doorman to the bellman to the servers in the bar. It's a comfortable place, close to just about anything in Chicago. The rooms are well appointed, functional. Whether it's either a large, professional meeting or simply a week-end getaway to the Windy City, the Sheraton Hotel & Towers should be in ones travel plans.

"My Wife and I just celebrated our 49th Wedding Anniversary and we usually spend a few days Downtown every year enjoying all the Christmas decorations. We always stay at the Sheraton Chicago Hotel and Towers (we always ask for a room with a ""River View"") and the Sheraton Again treated us like Royalty. Everyone from the Doorman to the nice person that kept our room neat were just SUPER. The Front Desk Crew were outstanding as always. Thank You Again for a Wonderful visit."
"I had the opportunity to stay at the Sheraton Towers from Dec. 3-8 for a Dental Implant Conference. First, the location of the hotel was primo. Easy walking distance to many fine restaurants, shopping, and Chicago must see locations (John Hancock Bldg, Water Tower, etc.). Check-in was easy, friendly, and the lobby was nicely decorated for the Christmas. Our room was not ready, but they handled our luggage and provided access to the lounge. Our room was top notch. We were on the 35 floor and had a great view of the lake and the Navy pier. The room was inviting and comfortable. Plenty of room to spread out, work at the desk, or just watch TV. No problem sleeping on those beds-very comfortable! Everyone we encountered at the hotel was very helpful, especially the doorman. He provided many excellent dining recommendations and directions. The concierge was also very helpful, but usually busier than the doorman. The restaurants provided excellent choices and the food was very good! Better than one expects from many hotels. I was a repeat offender and enjoyed each meal. The bar was centrally located with an excellent wine list. I had reservations for another meeting at the Swissotel midweek, but cancelled them to stay at the Sheraton and walk to the other hotel for the meeting. Being a Gold Member at the Marriott and Hilton Hotels, I was skeptical about staying at the Sheraton. No more! I will make the Sheraton my hotel of choice in Chicago. Thanks to everyone who made our visit exceptional. Cannot wait to return."
"The Sheraton Chicago Towers is well-located along the river, with good views from all directions, including of the river, cityscapes and peaks at Lake Michigan. The rooms are well-appointed, though not very spacious for the room rate. The beds are comfortable, with big heavy comforters and lighter comforters underneath, so whatever you prefer is available.

"The customer service at this hotel is delightful. The doorman was very welcoming as we exited our vehicle. Adam at Check In was more than accommodating. He noticed my request for extra pillows and asked if I would prefer feathered pillows. When he found out I was in town for the Hot Chocolate Race he offered us a 1pm check out which I gladly accepted. He even gave me a coupon for a free drink and snack at the hotel. Thank you so much Adam for your hospitality. As we entered our very clean room with lots of pillows we were thrilled with the beautiful view of the river and the park down below, the lake to our left and the buildings which were so beautifully lit at night. The next morning after our race the staff gave us information so we could get a cart sent to our room for our bags. The sweetest man came to our room with the cart and brought it down for us as well as helping us get to our valet parking. This hotel really understands customer service and I will most definitely stay again. By the way, the beds were very comfortable and halls were quiet. I slept like a baby. It is also located near shopping, Navy Pier, Michigan Avenue, architecturally significant buildings and the architectural tour (which I highly recommend) and not far from Millennium Park."
"I traveled with a co worker for 3 nights/ 4 days for a conference held at the hotel. The rooms were clean and nice but a little small. The shower water pressure was very good! Although it almost hurt if you stayed in too long. The view from our room (1431) was wonderful! We had a full view of the river and even Lake Michigan off in the distance. The conference rooms were nice and the escalators made it easy to get from floor to floor because it seemed like everything was on a different floor. The only complaint I have is that I don't like the refrigerator in the room that is full of beverages for purchase. We had no room to keep our personal soda or water. And the ice bucket they provided was too small to use to keep our drinks cold. Overall the staff was friendly and the service we received was good. We also enjoyed our breakfast from the cafe there in the morning. Although service was a little slow the food was delicious! If I were to come again I may stay right on Michigan Ave, instead of a few streets over, since that is where we spent most of our free time."
"Just a short thank you note to Rhea Alejo - I travel to Chicago quite frequently due to business and have the choice between a very nice Westin on Magnificient Mile, the two W's or even another Westin in River North. The Sheraton Chicago Hotel and Towers has always exceeded my expectations and you have contributed to that. I will continue to book this hotel due to the warm hospitality you have shown me. Apart from the fantastic amenities you offer (Lounge, great Bar, great restaurant), it is associated like you who make this hotel one of choice, especially for SPG members.Thank you!"
"Lobby is big, exciting, warm and inviting. If you live in New York, LA or Michigan you will enjoy the property. The front desk staff was warm and the wait time to get to the desk was instant. Amsale Kassa could not have been more perfect checking us in, her smile matched the hotels overall feel. Thank you Starwood for ensuring my visit to Chicago was perfect especially as it was my husbands birthday weekend!"
"Booked five rooms for a group going to see Notre Dame in South Bend making Chicago our home base for the weekend. As a group we all are SPG members but all of us did not receive upgraded rooms to the club level very disappointing especially since being a member the longest pushed my group to enroll and choose this hotel. The location is prime for the river walk and grant park, mag. mile, navy pier, excellent location. The hotel is very large and quite often is booked with conventions so it is very busy. The concierge desk are staffed with more than one person and do an excellent job, the valet guys are very friendly and excellent at directions and tips on where to go. Check in was smooth for me as Galen immediatley recognized me as loyal spg member and upgraded me to a club level room extending us a late check out as needed for our group. The room was clean and well appointed and the view up river from the 32 floor looking at the beautiful trump tower was magnificent. Only issue we had was and it was very disappointing was the adjacent room was full of loud teenage girls and mean loud you could hear them down the hall as we approached our room, of course you can imagine when we got into our room how loud and disturbing it was. The only visit from security didn't have the impact we had hoped as the rest of the night was a nightmare and of course no sleep. The whole next day I was a zombie. Overall I highly recommend this hotel for its location and excellent staff minus the security team of course. Thanks Sheraton we will be coming back for our next trip in the summer.


Room Tip: Ask for a upgrade to the club level rooms in the high 20s and up views are spectacular!!

"First time in Chicago and we spent three days at this hotel. It is located along the 'River Walk' close to the architectural cruise ports and only a 5-min walk to the 'Magnificent Mile' packed with high-end shopping and restaurants. Key highlights include:Pros- Location, location, location- Amazing view of downtown Chicago from virtually every angle of the hotel; definitely ask for a room on a high floor- One of the best fitness centers with, again, incredible ceiling-to-floor windows overlooking the River Walk and a spacious yet enclosed balcony for outdoor yoga during the right season- If it's a beautifuld day outside and you don't want to exercise indoors, the River Walk is only steps awayCons- Because it is a central hotel, it is quite a long trek from Chicago O'Hare International Airport. Traffic adds to the meter and it seems like there's always traffic. Avg. taxi fare one way is $55+. If you can find alternate transportation, recommend you do.- Customer service was not as hospitable as other hotels of comparable chains. We sampled most services offered in the hotel from check-in, concierge, valet, bell hop, guest room, FedEx and more. The hotel greeters and concierge desk were the most hospitable - friendly and patient with questions. All other services were unfriendly/curt, sometimes impatient with questions. - The rooms are dated and of subpar quality; the view helped me overlook these I'm not a high-maintenance traveller so I'm open to overlooking the cons and appreciating the pros. However, I rate customer service very high on my list as an important experience and this hotel has some improvements to make in this area to help make guests feel welcomed."
"This is the first time I have visited Downtown Chicago. Sheraton is well located on the river with great views, easy walk to most tourist interested sights including the river boat tours. The open-top bus stop is literally at the door step. The staff especially at the reception is efficient and friendly. There are great variety of restaurant in-house ranging from coffee shop to a great steak house. The rooms are spacious and I had the best night sleep in a hotel there as the pillows and the Duvet are the best. I was told that you can buy them on their website. However, the beds are a little bit high for older folks. Would definitely return when I have a chance.


Room Tip: Higher floors facing East has the best view of the Navy Pier.

"This was a last minute trip to present at a seminar being held in the hotel, so I didn't do any research and just booked. I honestly haven't stayed in a Sheraton anywhere in a very long time. So I had no expectations going in and was pleasantly surprised to find it to be an older hotel with some personality that's been kept up very well. It was clean everywhere, room was comfortable and service at all touchpoints was very good. Internet speed in the room was around 1.9 Mbps up/down and I'd like to see that higher. Food quality in the banquet areas was well done, too. A nice touch in the ChiBar is that they serve a nice snack mix with your drinks, which made watching the world series game going on at the time all the more pleasant."
"Clean, spacious and quiet rooms is always a great experience. If staying here, see if they can give you Navy Pier view.Sheraton hotel is my ""go to"" hotel every time I visit Chicago for business. Within walking distance, you have a pharmacy, great sushi bar and other restaurants, movie theatre, bowling alley, liquor store and many other places, it is OK to say that is very well located. At other hotels, waiting for a taxi in the middle of winter could be a really cold and bad experience. However, this hotel has a heated entrance that keeps you nice and warm while you wait for your car.The bar area at the lobby is a great happy hour scene and perfect for chilling out after a hard day of work. And, although it could get really noisy, it does not affect noise levels in lower rooms.I definitely recommend staying here."
"As a frequent business traveler and Starwood loyalist, I've stayed in a lot of hotels and Sheratons specifically. This property is in a terrific location and is a solid choice for anyone visiting Chicago for work or business. It's bright, recently updated, and has a very nice space in the lobby for congregating. The bed was more comfortable than most and the gym is huge and very well appointed.

"The hotel is a 7 minute hike from the Midway airport to downtown subway stop. So for $3.50 transit you get a little exercise. It's a busy big city hotel and the staff are trained to be helpful. The service is not spectacular, but it is warm, helpful and friendly. Rooms are what you would expect in this price range and location. There are some super-nice views of the river so it is worth requesting. I had some issues at checkout which weren't the hotel's fault, but I did expect a little more than ""Sorry, no refund on your cancellation"" from the manager, especially as it was a convention and the room would be rented our regardless. Overall a nice enough place and convenient. If you are booking a convention. the tech services are excellent, but some of the other support services are lacking in odd and unaccountable ways. You have to be willing to be assertive to get stuff done right and as expected.

"We stayed here for 3 nights in September and thoroughly enjoyed it. There was a little confusion over my reservation but that was only because we had been upgraded to a suite which looked odd in the booking system to the new employee on the front desk. The room was simple yet elegant. The maid service was awesome. A brief walk to get to many of the river boat companies along the river and the Magnificent Mile. I would definitely stay here the next time I am in the Windy City!

"A decent Sheraton average room a little dated if you ask me they could use a some TLC I do think that the hotel gets a little overwhelmed at times it's a very large and it just seems like they lose track of what's going on from time to time the one thing I find a little odd is that sometimes when I try to book this hotel even with so many room I can't find a room or they want some astronomical amount of money they tell me the main reason for this is because they host a lot of conferences and they have a tendency to block off large sections meaning that the average traveler who just wants to go for a day or two can't always get a good room here at least this is been my personal experience

"Dad and I have a tradition staying at this hotel when we visit Chicago around the holiday season. Our experience this time was good with room for improvement:1) We got upgraded to a suite with our Suite Night award2) Our room was spacious, and the TV in the bed room was not working very well, very likely due to the fact that the hotel is doing renov at the time (cable wiring etc.)3) The club lounge is closed due to renov.4) Albeit the substitutes vouchers to the Club Lounges were great, the quality of the vouchers was inconsistent. And the vouchers were still not a complete substitute for the Club Lounge, where I find more of an escape from most hassels and noises5) We ran into one of our familiar front desk ladies. She is with blonde hair, and she is fantastic. We have seen her there about 8 years (some years in the club lounge and some years at the front desk). She is always great!Overall, a good stay. Very good staff.

"Coming to the Sheraton Hotel and Towers is like coming home. Everyone works very hard to make sure you have a good experience while you are staying at the hotel. From the moment I check-in until check-out the staff works very hard to assist you. I stay and the Sheraton several times a year and can honestly say, I have enjoyed each one. The location is also a plus, plenty of shopping, sightseeing and fine dining within walking distance! Great place to stay while in Chicago."
"Due to unforeseen circumstances, my three day business trip turned into a two week plus stay. The staff - from the concierge desk, housekeeping, and the Starwood Club, could not have been more accommodating to the special medical request and assistance we required. This personal service and concern for me and my family's comfort during this time made our situation so much better. This true heart felt hospitality from staff members is a reflection of the pride they have in their work and their property. Thank you."
"Booked a 1 night stay on Hotels.com. Upon trying to check in, we found out there was no evidence I booked a room and the hotel was completely sold out.With a quick call to Hotels.com we figured out that they completely misspelled my name. Ahhh. foreign customer service.....Need I say more....Anyway, the check in was smooth. Excellent room with a river view. Near most of the activitieswe wanted to hit. Tour bus pick-up was just across the street. Hop on and hop off wherever you wanted.The bed was great. Will stay again when in town."
"The hotel is beautiful and we had great service checking in. However, for the price we paid I was disappointed at how poorly maintained their rooms and guest floors are. Carpets are stained in many different spots in the hallways, and our room didn't feel clean. Everything was very dusty. The bathroom had hair strands all over the floor, and the toilet rocked. Just not what you expect from a 4+ star hotel."
"We chose a last minute weekend getaway and this was the hotel with the availability and right price. It was right on the river and we walked Michigan Ave from here. The gps had a hard time finding the parking garage. Parking was $49 for 24 hours. The garage was clean and well lit. We stayed on the 10th floor so we had a great view. The room was fully stocked with snacks and drinks, but be prepared to pay. A can of Diet Coke was $5. the little fridge was so full there was no room to keep leftovers, which we did not like. Our room was clean and the bed was perfect. We were right off the elevator, so we could hear a little hall noise but it was pretty nice really. The have a little coffee shop and diner downstairs.Everyone was very polite and really friendly. They even served cheesecake and cupcakes in the lobby on Saturday night. We had a few drinks at the bar, a little pricey but there is a Walgreens about a block away if you want to mix your own drinks in your room. We would certainly stay here again."
"Checked in and went up to our room to change and head out to dinner. However, they had not cleaned the room prior to us getting there. Called the desk and the first thing they told me was that the hotel was fully booked (not we are sorry or anything else). They promised to call back and they didnt. We finally changed and left for dinner. Fortunately when we returned they had cleaned the room. Interestingly enough, we did not get an apology or any signal that they had screwed up.Great location but I think we will go elsewhere."
"Stayed at this hotel for 2 nights while on a business trip. There is nothing outstanding about this hotel in terms of what you would expect from a hotel, but I did have a few things that were bad.1. The room had almost no electric plugs. The plug build into the desk lamp did not work. There was one available under the desk and 2 in the bathroom. So plugging in a laptop, phone charger and iron was a challenge. One would think that in the digital age the hotel would make an effort to provide guests with accessible electrical outlets.2. The cover for the air conditioning unit rattled when the AC was on. It was loud enough to prevent me from falling asleep.3. The clock on the nightstand did not have a back-light, so figuring out time was a challenge even in daylight, and certainly at night.4. Bathroom contained long black hair on the floor, with the longest hair sitting on the water bowl of the toilet. I think it's gross having to stay in a room with human hair that is not yours. See attached photo.5. Bath/shower tiles where dirty, moldy, old and tired. See attached photo.The last problem is not really a reflection of the hotel. My first night I was awoken by a slamming door next to my room, followed by loud drunk people having a time of their lives. This activity kept me awake for 15 minutes before I called downstairs. They sent security up to ask the people to calm down. The noise subsided but I was now awake at 1:45am wishing I fall asleep fast so I could be ready for my early morning meetings.Let me also mention that I am in the travels business (IATAN member), and I would think twice before recommending this particular hotel to my clients."
"A terrible bed can mean a terrible stay, and a great bed makes a huge difference. I just loved the bed at the Sheraton - I was really tired my first night and just wanted to drop to sleep. The bed was super comfortable, the pillows were just right, and the high thread count sheets were awesome. They also did a great job making the bed, which I think can be made with the top sheet too tight for comfort! This was fantastic. Temperature control was perfect for sleeping as well, the bathroom mirror lighting was excellent for getting things ready. I was here for a conference and the catered meals were excellent as well. Nice job! Usually I'm a bit biased against large chain hotels in the downtown of a major city, since often they seem a bit shabby. Not at all the case here - I may need to reexamine my bias!"
"Whenever I travel to Chicago, I always stay at the Sheraton on the River. What a fantastic staff! Every level of employee I came into contact with was exceptionally kind and helpful. Whether you are with your family or away on a business trip, this hotel and staff will not disappoint! Easy walking distance to Navy Pier, Millenium Park and Michigan Ave. Club lounge staff were awesome!

"I loved the hotel! From the second we got there the staff was super helpful! Our room was nice and we even had a view of the water which was perfect. I do have to add that if you need any concierge assistance, you need to go see Marisa. She was SO helpful and so happy and nice. Every time we went over to here, she offered us many recommendations and tips and was so friendly-she definitely made a great impression on me for the hotel and I would go back for sure. Thanks so much Marisa, you were so great!! :) A tip regarding the rooms: ask if you can stay in a room with a nice view of the water because I don't think any other view will be as good. Have fun!"
"I stayed 3 nights at this hotel and it was great. Loved the 'green option' where you get points or $10 credit if you decline daily maid service. Rooms were clean, bed was so comfortable and it was really quiet although I believe the hotel was sold out. Never heard a sound. Had a great river and partial lake view. Staff was great too. I give this hotel an A+

"After 7 hours on my Chicago walkabout and a delightful F.L.Wright tour I arrived feeling very much like a tired 74 yr female. At the check in desk I met Mr. Michael Jackson. His smile, helpful advice and extremely pleasant manner made me feel welcome and perhaps a little relaxed. I tell everyone I care more about a view from my room than anything else. I had such a wonderful view I did not leave the room until morning. It was a delight. On check out I again had Mr. Jackson. I strongly suggest the management of this Hotel increase Mr. Jackson's income and when he wants, move him to whatever position he desires. Without the view the room is much as I've stayed around the world. I found the bed, pillows, towels, etc to be very acceptable. The only thing I wonder is why this chain would need revenue so bad it must charge for a college dorm type refrig. I love and drink a lot of Cold Water. At other hotels I am able to keep my water bottles cold. I wonder how much is really gained because I just use more of the Hotel's ice, keeping my water cold in the ice bucket. It was a very pleasant stay."
"From the moment we arrived, our experience was excellent. The staff was exceptionally accommodating and helpful, the facilities clean and well appointed, and for the first time in my life, I awoke with no back pain. The bed was the most comfortable on which I have slept in any hotel. The location was perfect for walking to Navy Pier and other favorite downtown attractions.

"So, my friends and I stayed here for my bachelorette party. When we arrived, we parked in the parking garage and then followed a crazy labyrinth of hallways to get to the lobby area. Once we go to the lobby, it was extremely nice! The check-in process was easy, and the room was great. We had a fantastic view of the river and of Lake Michigan! The beds were quite comfortable and not complaints about the bathroom.My only complaint was that apparently my Maid of Honor (who put the hotel rooms on her card) was charged for a bottle of Gatorade from the mini bar which we know we did NOT open. She called and asked which room out of the two it came from, and they couldn't even tell her that. We know we didn't touch any of those items, but we couldn't really dispute it and we were charged anyway.All in all, it was in a great location - walking distance to restaurants and bars - and we had a great time!


Room Tip: Definitely choose a room with a river view!

"We had stayed before through a Priceline Name-Your-Price deal, but chose it this time. We absolutely LOVE the location - especially in the summer as it is directly on the river. The room was large, clean and quiet - even though it was the first room off the elevator and across from the stairwell. The bedding is absolutely amazing (down comforter and lots of down pillows) and we had a nice view of the river. We enjoyed sitting outside one night at one of the ""fire tables"" along the river and could see part of the fireworks from Navy Pier. On our last day we had lunch at Chicago Burger and sat outside at one of the tables on the river. We enjoyed walking along the river at night, this hotel has easy access to Michigan Avenue, Millenium Station and there is a bridge to the other side of the river right outside the hotel. We will be back!"
"This was my second time visiting Chicago and this time I traveled alone and stayed for just one night. On my way from Mexico City to New York, I added in this stop because I am a huge baseball fan and have always wanted to see the Cubs play at famous Wrigley Field. The service at check-in was expedient, the concierge was helpful in guiding me towards the 'L' train to get to Wrigley, and the room I stayed in was very clean, beds were comfortable, and I had a great view of the river below. My only real negative point to make is on the price. When I visited Chicago for the first time in January of 2013, I was able to stay for 3 nights at the Conrad Hotel in the Hilton Portfolio- in my opinion at least 1.5 stars above this Sheraton- for only $25-30 extra per night. Overall, though, I was very pleased and will definitely consider booking at this Sheraton again on one of my future visits to the Windy City.

"I traveled to Chicago for a convention the end of April. I was there for several days and my wife flew in at the end for a mini vacation. Obviously, being in downtown this is a busy place, but my check in process was efficient and speedy. The room was nothing terribly special but fine. I had a nice view of the Chicago River and could see the lakefront as well. The amenities were good with plenty of soap and shampoo. The bed was comfortable and clean. The room was large enough we weren't crammed in though the bathroom was pretty small with only one sink. Don't you hate it when you're using the facilities and someone rams the door into your feet cause there's no room for it? *L*The hotel was quiet with not a lot of extraneous noise in the hall ways. Food was okay....breakfast was the best. Very few options for dinner with really only Shula's open at night. I didn't really want a big dinner so went wandering along the river and found a bar next door to the hotel. The meeting rooms were clean and functional.They made parking simple. I had driven to the hotel. It was easy to pick up the car once you followed the maze down to get it. I'd stay there again though have stayed in much nicer hotels in Chicago. It's priced reasonably for a convention hotel."
"I am an SPG member. I am a National officer for the APWU and attended our National convention from July 16-26. I had to switch my room a total of four times.I was promised to have my bags moved from room to room and each time I was disappointed, they were not. I basically had to live out of a suitcase . Now I know why I usually dont stay at SPG hotels. I gave them another shot and the result was total failure. I consider myself an easy going person but felt compelled to write this. The hotel knows how to take reservations but not hold them. This never should have happened with such an advance booking. Beware!"
"While the room we stayed in was in need of renovation (which we were told is being done), the staff and location made up for all other flaws. From the front desk clerk at check-in, to the guest room attendants, to the waiter in Shula's Restaurant who showed great concern because I wasn't feeling great, we had an exceptional experience. These were the friendliest people in any hotel I have ever stayed. I firmly belief attitude is created at the top. If you treat your employees nicely, they tend to be nice to customers. Congrats on a great staff! As for the location, terrific! We walked everywhere easily.

"I spend two nights at this hotel for a reunion in June. Everything about my stay was nice and smooth. The beds were comfortable, the rooms were clean, and the front desk was helpful. When I was checking in, the price of my room actually went down, and front desk gave me the lower price, which I was very appreciative about. However, the hotel is a short walk from the famous Michigan Ave shopping, so was convenient in that sense.I did NOT use any of the hotels facilities (gym, restaurant, etc.) so cannot comment on that. It is a large hotel, so does not have that warm and cozy feeling of boutique or independent hotels, but they did everything right. It is what you would expect of a Sheraton. I would recommend this hotel to others."
"One of the most beautiful hotels I've ever stayed at. Everything was pristine, the staff was beyond courteous and helpful, and the location is great. The shower was better than most hotel showers, too. Fitness center was nice and the bed was comfortable. It takes a few minutes to get to the el, so if it's wintertime I imagine that's not very pleasant, but other than that everything was perfect. There is a great espresso bar right across the street--nice perk!"
"I want to share my TERRIBLE experience in the Sheraton Hotel in Chicago this past Friday the 25th of July.I went with my family to go around Chicago sites and when we went back from Dinner & party around 2:30am i went into my room #2235. I was walking from the elevator to my room and 2 Afroamerican females came from other room in front of me and start dancing very close with me and (3 sec) and one of them took my wallet with credit cards and 800 usd in cash.I figured out when i came to my room that i did not have my wallet and i ran very fast to the lobby and the 2 females went in a taxi i was not able to recover my wallet. I felt very very frustrated with the situation. I call the police and file the report #HX359387Next day i talked with the sheraton Manager and the security responsible and explain the situation and my concern.Honestly i was expecting to recover to me the 800 usd but of course they just say ""i am sorry""My phone number if someone want to know more details is 2692773697This trip was with my family, my Mother, my 2 kids and my sister and her complete family, in total 8 persons in 2 rooms.Juan Carlos Fernandez"
"We had a corner room with two wide windows, with expansive views of Chicago's skyline. The bed was incredibly comfortable, great nights' sleep both nights.

Also, the VIP room with yummy fruit, bakery goods and selection of juices for a nice Continental breakfast was a nice treat.

"Sometimes you don't really understand a hotel's service mentality until there is serious problem to be solved. A couple of days ago, we were staying at the Sheraton when we came back after a long day of sightseeing to find that they we doing some maintenance work on the hotel elevators that involved some pretty strong smelling paint or stain. For most people, this would have been a minor inconvenience as they passed through the hallway and went on to their rooms.For my wife and daughter however, it was a huge issue. Both suffer from severe migraines brought on by smells, among other things. From the moment we set foot back in the hotel, they were sick and getting sicker. The smell was in the halls and the room. For most people, including me, the smell quickly faded into the background and stopped being noticeable. However, they were in bad shape.Over the course of about two hours, the hotel front desk and the manager on duty, Caitlin Gooding, went out of their way to help us. They offered us different rooms throughout the hotel to try and get us away from the smell. The bell staff moved us a couple of times. They even offered a suite on the top floor, thinking this would solve the problem. And throughout the process, they were patient, helpful and understanding. In the end, they couldn't find a room for us where my family couldn't smell the paint, so Caitlin arranged a room for us at a nearby Westin. I was so appreciative of her patience and the personal interest she took, especially because the smell was not obvious to someone who doesn't have the sensitivity (including me). Yet, she persevered to a solution. We think that she and the staff at the Sheraton were great!"
"We stayed here for a family trip to Chicago. I got the room half price through hotwire. Parking is $49 a night for self park or $58 for valet. The only difference in the location of each is self park is the floor beneath, but there is an elevator. Upon check in, you will be asked for a credit card that automatically will charge you $100 for incidentals. When you check out, that money is supposed to be credited back to you, or whatever you didn't spend. In the room there is a stocked fridge but a coke is $5. You can't put your own things in the fridge, you have to get another fridge brought to you. Also there are snacks in the room, but $7 for the M&ms? The snacks are in plain site with sensors under them. If you have young children, this might be a problem. Phone calls from the room cost money. Gym and pool is nice. Just a cpl blocks from Michigan ave. Right on the riverwalk. Lots of restaurants around and shopping. Overall, nice hotel, but it seems they try to nickel and dime you to death if you aren't careful."
"Great full service Sheraton with an exceptional location right on the riverfront in Chicago. The meeting space is immense and allows for large sized meetings. Shula's restaurant is a good dining option, but there are fabulous restaurants all around for additional options.The rooms are well done, recently renovated, and very comfortable. The bedding is luxurious and the AC units in each room work well - overcoming even the worst heat and humidity that Chicago has to offer."
"What a beautiful place, my mouth dropped open right from the door! I stayed there one night for my 5 years anniversary and let me tell you i was so happy that i had booked there! The hotel is very clean and big! I loved that they have like 3 or 4 places to eat at the hotel and as well the river walk on the south of the hotel was very clean and beautiful! I would like to give a special thanks to Megan in housekeeping for making our stay at sheraton a memory to not ever forget! I as well want to thank ""NIA "" at the check in she was very helpful and very welcoming , to the point where she had called us in our room to see how my stay was going and if there was anything that we needed just let her know! That is a truly great service ! Great job ""Nia""! Even though my wife and i live in chicago very often we love staying in downtown, i got to say after this stay here, Sheraton has become my favorite hotel!"
"Just had our first experience at this hotel. What a great experience. Parking however is a bit costly and sometimes the hotel does not allow for self parking. The first room was a lake view, however, caution not all rooms are actually what they say they are. The front desk agent, Mia, said we had the lake view which was what we signed on for. However she did not mention that there may be construction in our way. Needless to say, it was not much of a lake view. We called down and instead opted for a nicer view, one that we had paid for and made the trip for. She changed our room to a very nice view of the Chicago River. We were very happy with this change and plan to make a yearly visit out of it! We loved loved loved that room! Wish the prices for the mini-bar, snacks, and internet was free like many other hotels in the area offer. Maybe they should opt in to giving guest free snacks, such as a cookie like the DoubleTree.

Everything was great -- service, room, restaurants, location, etc. I arrived early but they got me in a great room. Every hotel employee I interacted with was courteous and professional. Room was clean, neat, sizable, and quiet. Only thing I didn't like was the minibar and snacks available are movement activated, which could be a nightmare if you have small children. I just didn't touch it. The location is superb, within walking distance of so many things to do. One weekend definitely not enough!"
"I stayed at this hotel for the 4th of July. I chose this hotel because it was dog friendly. Everyone was very nice to my little dogs. They were soooo busy on the 4th of July, but they accommodated us as best they could. I reserved connecting rooms and when I got there it was not ready. They gave us a voucher so we can eat at the restaurant while we waited and as an apology for having to wait. Well we waited for 2 hours and they told us they couldn't give us a connecting room which we had reserved. When they gave us our room it was just not feasible for 5 people and 2 dogs so they took us out of the room and ended up giving us the connecting room we originally requested. It was frustrating but at the same time I know they were really busy. We were able to cross the street and watch the fireworks at night on Columbus Ave. on top of the bridge. The next day we went to the River Walk which is below the hotel and did some kayaking and rode on the water taxi. I recommend this hotel and I would stay here again. They have good staff and a great location. There is an indoor pool which is great for the kids. The beach is near by to, just a quick taxi ride away as well as Navy Pier."
"Stayed at the Sheraton Hotel Downtown from July 13th thru the 19th for the purpose of a convention. So the room was paid for at a discount rate of $250 per night, taxes included.The Hotel: The Hotel is 32 stories high serviced by 2 separate banks of 6 elevators broken down as to where you are going. To the left is the elevators for Lobby thru 16th floor, the elevators to the right are for floors 17 thru the top. Never had to wait too long to wait for elevator at any time of day, and I didn't see staff using the elevators.The hotel has a Dob Shulas steak restaurant, a Burger Bar, and a Bisto type restaurant. The hotel also has large meeting spaces. The hotel pool and spa center is up in the 7th floor, and it was a decent sized pool, and a gym that seem well equipped. The spa also had a sauna. The hotel is within walking distance to many restaurants, and the famous Navy Pier.Check In: Check in was a breeze, I got the high floor I wanted, and I was on my way in no time. Please beware, this hotel puts what I consider a large incidental deposit, $250, on the credit card that is used, so that money is unavailable. Most hotels I use only do $100. The staff explained to me that the deposit amount is dependent on length of stay.The Room: I had a king size bedroom, and the room itself was plenty big. In addition to the king berm there was a small desk, a dresser with a 42"" TV, the dresser also included the wet bar refrigerator. The great thing is, you can say what your room deposit is used for, so that if you don't want to use the wet bar, you can say so, and they wet bar fridge will lock itself. I though that was neat. I had my fridge locked when I saw the prices they wanted. The room also had a ottoman chair, and windows had blackout drapes. The view is toads the Trump Tower from the room. The room also comes with a closet that had plenty of hangers, a ironing board w/iron, and a built in wall safe that is NOT big enough for a laptop, but plenty rom for a tablet device..The Bathroom: The bathroom was of good size, with a good vanity space area, which is where you also get your free daily 8oz bottle of water. The bat tub was plenty spacey and I found that their was plenty of hot water at good pressure. There was towel setup with 3 of everything, bath towels, was cloths, and hand towels.Misc: The hotel does have a taxi stand manned by bellhops. When you need a cab, just get in line and tell bellhop where you want to go, the bellhop blows his whistle, and a cab shows up. If you need more luxurious ride, they can do that too.I ate at the Burger Bar down by the water, and a Bacon Cheeseburger, Friea and Root beer cost me $23, which I think is outrageous. The same can be said to the room service menu. $28 for a cheese omelet, you have to be kidding me. The prices in general at the restaurants and room service menu, were, in mu opinion, way off the chart for what they should be. I know hotel is in the corporate section of Chicago, but $28 for a omelet. They are crazy. Luckily they are plenty of restaurants in area with reasonable prices. The telephones are another expansive item, if you were to use it. And they charge for use of their wifi, which is another, outrageous cost, which I think was around $10/day.The hotel is also within walking distance to the Navy Pier, where you can eat, play, or take a dinner cruise.Bottom Line: I loved this hotel, very comfortable, and the service was unmatched. I just hated that they had the balls to charge as much as they diid for ancillary services, and their food prices.


Green Features: The hotel has a program where if you go without room service for a certain amount of days, you get a $10 credit. Also, they do the whole, if the towel is not on the floor, they don't replace it"
"Stayed over a Saturday. According to the desk clerk, the hotel was full because the Chicago marathon was being ran that weekend. The lobby that looks out onto the river was never crowded. Neither was the hotel pool. The workout equipment was state of the art and all was clean and clean towels were available. Lockers were available in the locker room.


Room Tip: Get a room on a higher floor. The desk said that the upper floors had been more recently renovated...

"Stayed at the Illinois Suite of this hotel for 4th July this year - fantastic experience. Location is absolutely wonderful, just minutes walk to Navy Pier, Michigan Street and my personal favorite - Water Taxi Stop. Breathtaking view from the tower. The interior is luxurious yet guest friendly, well maintained and managed. Love the staff - highly professional and genuinely caring - asked for mini fridge, roll-away bed, additional towels, all delivered within 5-10 minutes. Front desk is polite and efficient, and the staff at the Club Lounge is amazing - funny and friendly, feels like family, good view and nice food (it was jam packed during the two days of my stay but they pulled it off making you feel no pressure at all).Parking is a little expensive but hey it's downtown Chicago so what can you do... A true five-star experience! Can't wait till go back there!


Room Tip: If you have access to the Club Loung, try to get a room on 18th floor and above. They have this exp...

"We have stayed in a number of hotels in Chicago for weekend getaways. Each time we like it, and each time, we try something a little different. Until now. I think when I go back, I'll always go to this Sheraton.Perfect location, but then, all hotels in downtown are. All have cool shops and attractions within walking distance. Lots of photo ops and great location to host family who have never been to the windy city before. Just steps away from Millenium Park, Nike World, and Macy's - something for everyone.Perfect location for the boat tours - we got on the first tour of the day on Saturday for the tour that includes river and lake. PLUS, The Sheraton is one of the buildings highlighted on that tour.Our delightful concierge, Paula, helped us get boat tickets and dinner reservations. Very helpful since we were only there for a short weekend.Rooms were nice, we have views of the Navy Pier Fireworks from our room, and the bar was fun, spacious, and a great place to watch soccer.Everything went smoothly - we'll be back!


Room Tip: As high up as possible

"Attended a business conference there for 2 nights. Overall hotel is not impressive. Tired carpeting throughout. Conference rooms are small and in basement. AV help was slow not always working. Bed sheets, mattress and pillows are old or of poor quality. Can't open windows in bedroom. On good side: food was decent, staff was friendly, bathroom and room were a good size. Would not choose to stay there again."
"The hotel was nicely located in Downtown Chicago and also close to Navy Pier. There was plent of shopping, places to eat, and entertainment nearby. The staff was friendly and helpful. We upgraded our room to a king with a city view. It was well worth the upgrade for the bed and the view. The Keurig in the room was a very nice touch. The only complaint I have is that we found hair in our bed both nights we stayed. I had hoped that a hotel of this caliber would have paid attention to that small detail.


Room Tip: Pay for the city view. It was wonderful.

"It can be tough to find a decent hotel in downtown Chicago that is relatively close to everything, is moderately priced and is pleasant and clean...Swissotel is one of those few.The staff is friendly and attentive, and you experience a cool, hip vibe the moment you walk in. (Speaking of walking, you are close enough to walk to Chicago's premier shopping area, ""the Miracle Mile"".)The design is a bit contemporary, clean and fun.Good drinks at their bar, good food at their cafe and they always seem to have a few rooms left, again, for a fair price, when everyone else seems to be sold out.Many go for the major chains and names, but do yourself a favor next time and give Swissotel a try; you won't be disappointed!"
"One standard river view room included city, river, lake, and Navy Pier view. The hotel sits at an angle to make this happen. I stayed at the W Lakeshore the week prior to my stay at the Swissotel. Both had imbecile rooms, service, and views...but the Swissotel will be my first choice next time around because of its location (quick walk to the Art Institute of Chicago and Millennium Park) and mix of city and water view."
Stayed there for a couple of nights while on a business trip. The location of the hotel is nice (the only nice thing with the view) if you want to do some shopping or visit the city. The lobby is OK. Things get horrible when you get to the room. First the door room does not close really well. I thought this was a problem with the initial room I was given. However I asked to be relocated and had the same problem with the second room. The furniture in the room is horrible and the bathroom is not nice. Breakfast is takne in the basement. Overall not a nice experience. I will never return there.
"Had to overnight in Chicago because of Amtrak train cancellation.Hotel was provided by Amtrak and it turned out to be a much nicer property than I expected.Check in was quick and courteous. Had room on 32nd floor which had view of navy pier and Lake Michigan.Room was large, nice bathroom with both shower and separate bath.Only complaint was the pillows are too firm.Would recommend for business travel."
"Swissotel is in a great location, I love to walk everywhere so felt like it was very central to everything. I was there for sightseeing so was out all day & only in the hotel to sleep. beds are super comfy, staff very friendly & concierge very helpful. The elevators at first were a little confusing that you have to press the first number of your room & it will tell you by alphanumeric letters which elevator to catch makes your trip up/down much quicker. Great views of Navy Pier. I liked the coffee machine in the room, but a biscuit on the side would've been a nice touch. I also loved the infused water with fruit in the lobby a nice touch. Keep up the friendly positive vibe Swissotel"
First time staying here - in town for a conference. Rooms were nice - great view - seemed very efficient. My only complaint would be when we checked in there was some issues with how the room was booked and the person checking us in felt like he had to educate all of us on how problematic this was and that next time we should do better. That doesn't always sit well with a bunch of college professors and administrators.... but I did like the room and my preference would be to come back here again next year!
"Overall a very nice hotel property, tastefully decorated with up-to-date guest rooms. Beautiful views of the Navy Pier with easy access to Michigan Ave shopping and the highway. The pool on the 42nd floor was nice and warm and our kids really enjoyed that. The staff we interacted with were very responsive and pleasant to deal with. Downside: The only negative thing about staying here was the price of parking. $65 per day to park is ridiculous. I could see maybe $35 a day, but to spend $130 for 2 days parking seems insane to me. That's almost as much as lodging for a night."
The Swiss is a great hotel in downtown Chicago. We really enjoyed the whole experience of staying there except the dining options in the hotel. Most of Chicago's great hotels have great restaurants on site which the Swiss didn't.  The location is great for shopping or visiting Millenium Park. You are in the middle of it all.  I could not give it 5 stars because of the dining options but I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone.
"I would recommend this hotel. Rooms were nice. They are a little dated, but are in no way in shambles. The beds are very comfortable, the views are great, and the bathroom is above average. Be prepared, as everything in this area of the city, really the city in general, is expensive. That being said, you can get to the museums, shopping, restaurants, etc., all very easily with a $10 or less cab. I would of given this a 5 star review if it wasn't for the pool area that left something to be desired. (I visited with kids) You wont be disappointed and the really negative reviews are off base."
"This is the second Swissotel I have stayed in. The other was Sir Stamford Raffles in Singapore. The Singapore hotel is outstanding. My review of the Chicago hotel will be ongoing during my current stay. Checked in late last night and everything went smoothly. My room was ready and clean. It's got a fantastic view of the Navy Pier. I did ask for strawberries and champagne for my arrival, but I found champagne and an anniversary cupcake when I arrived. It wished me all the best on my non-existent anniversary. No big deal though seeing as the cupcake was delicious. The bathroom is what I would expect for a hotel of this class. The walls are a little thin though and I can hear my neighbors so that is something to keep in mind. I'm here for five days so I will update later. Paul W."
"I will start with the positives: The beds are very comfortableThe view from the corner king rooms is great The room, lobby, etc are very hip and well decoratedThe bath products were decent I would put the general feel and look of the hotel on par with other 4 star hotelsThe location was pretty good (about a 5-10 min walk from the Magnificent Mile) Now the negatives:Our room did not have heat and it was well below freezing outside. We complained twice and was not offered a new room for over 6 hours after checking in. It was literally 48 degrees in our room when we were finally given a new room. It was Valentine's Day and the hotel was near capacity, so we were given the exact same room, despite being forced to switch rooms at 10:30 pm (it was a higher floor). Given that it was a special night, we did not make a big deal of it with management, although he did offer to adjust the rate to $199 (the original price was $279). The next morning, upon checkout, we were told that the best they could do was a 25% discount for us (that does not add up to the price agreed upon the night before). At this point, the counter staff acted as if she was doing us a favor by giving us a room with heat and said there was nothing more they would do for us. What is most upsetting about this situation is not that the room didn't have heat, as we understand that things happen. It was that the hotel did not make an effort to right this wrong, and the general service and attitude was very poor. Other negatives:Dust bunnies in the air ventTowel had large (12 inch in diameter) hole in itNo free internet (typical, but still annoying) Champagne offered in the date night package is actually two glasses of Prosecco at the barTook more than two calls to get us removed from a 48 degree roomThe hotel needs to work on their service and general attitude towards their customers."
"I've stayed at the Swissotel countless times. It's a welcoming place with contemporary-style rooms that offer beautiful to spectacular views of Lake Michigan and the North River. The views of the lake used to be even more expansive until they built the Raddison Blue Hotel nearby but that's life in major urban area. The rooms are exceptionally spacious and airy and the bedding is sumptuous. There is a great workspace and a sitting area and plenty of outlets for devices. Coffee makers are included in each room and we often get breakfast included. I first began staying there with with my husband because we have family and friends in the city and the Swissotel offered a government employee rate we couldn't beat. We've subsequently become Swissotel members and get fantastic upgrades when we stay depending on the time of year. We almost always get moved to a large corner room with excellent views of the city but we've also been given suites for the price of a king room which are luxuriously spacious and sumptuous. The staff is wonderfully responsive and the hotel is located just off Michigan Ave but also tucked away from noise. If it's shopping you want, you can pop down to Nordstrom or the other high end shops along Michigan Ave. in minutes and if you want a serene walk on the banks of Lake Michigan, you're there in less than than ten minutes with a lovely walk down the North River until you get there. Restaurants abound in this area and you can have your pick of places within a short jaunt of the hotel. We like to eat at the bar if we want something on the lighter side. The hotel has its own restaurant but you can find most of the main dishes at the very open bar without a wait and the wine list is extensive. Service is tops. Then back up to your room for steamy shower or a soak before you turn in for the night. The bathrooms are solid--they have tubs and showers--nice to have a choice. Parking on site is available and the staff make every effort to bring your car to the front quickly but it's very pricey. If you don't need constant access to your car, there are garages a block or so down that offer parking for half the price. There's a new Whole Foods that's being completed a hop, skip and jump away if you feel like buying sandwiches etc for your dinner or lunch and the Art Institute is a beautiful walk from the hotel in the warm weather. My husband and I took advantage of a deal the Fairmont (which is down the street) was offering about a month ago since it's supposed to be a more upscale hotel and we stayed there overnight. Compared to the Swissotel, the rooms were tiny and not well appointed. The bed was too soft and the views were non-existent. We won't make that mistake again. And we'll continue staying at the Swissotel the next time we visit Chicago."
"Nice hotel for the price you pay. This seems to be more of a business hotel you're charged for everything. Wifi, wine glasses, you name it there's a charge. I visited this hotel for my first trip ever to Chicago on my birthday. I was sort of expecting something thoughtful or made up by the staff since they knew of the occasion but I was sadly mistaken. The hotel is nice, staff is nice and so are the rooms. I will probably come back here just not for memorable moments because unfortunately they don't believe in those."
"I ended up staying here when a quick Chicago trip turned into an over night with the snow. Ahhhh, Chicago in February. I found a great last minute deal and figured I'd stay here this time.My check in was delayed. I had to wait about 20 minutes for my company's off-price reservation to go into their system. The people at the front desk weren't overly sympathetic. I suppose I understand why front desk staff don't like dealing with off-price customers, but if it is that much of a bother, they shouldn't work with these deal site.When my reservation finally did get into their system, they offered me my choice of a high or low floor. I was able to get the high floor room I requested, even with bit of a view. The room was very comfortable and large.For me, the only weakness of this hotel is that there is not much life in the area immediately around the hotel. If you're looking for a lively street scene with different options, I would look someplace else. If a big room with a view is most important to you - this is the place. I just hope you get the same kind of great deal that I did. Happy travels!

"Arrived in Chicago just for a quick vacation from Georgia. It was the most immaculate hotel I have ever been in. The staff was excellent. Sharange was especially nice, she brought up menu of local pizza places we acquired about. Top Notch Service. I had a corner room with City view and navy pier. I fell in love with the view, I left curtains open all night just to see the beautiful buildings in lights. Room is very clean. Only thing which was small is the TV channels, I missed a few of my favorite shows but it's okay. We stayed for 4 nights. I could stay there forever. Next time I visit Chicago, here I come Swisshotel."
"Decent hotel. However, I did pay extra for a ""city view"" and I was on the 6th floor (technically city view but not worth the extra money). I checked in and they asked me if I wanted to pay $50 for an upgrade to a higher floor. No. Then I had a requested 2 beds and he said that I wouldn't get a view. I opted for the king bed on the 6th floor. Then I find out the couple we were with were offered a FREE upgrade to a high floor with late check-out. Then we get to our 6th floor room and after a while realize the floor is all wet. Now they have to move us to the 38th floor with 2 beds. I thought I wouldn't get a view with a room with 2 beds? So after all that, I ended up with the room I should have gotten in the first place. Nice room but shower is way too small. Shower pressure was awful too. However, I'm noticing that alot of hotels are doing this these days. Would I stay again? Maybe if it was the best rate I could get, but otherwise no."
"I stayed here with my husband for a mini getaway. I have stayed here before because of the excellent service and overall accommodations. This time I hit a snag that really dampered my impression. I wanted to surprise my husband with a bottle of champagne and treats in our room when we arrived. I called the Concierge and she emailed me a form to fill out. It only showed credit card information and no place to indicate what I wanted to order. So I emailed back and another Concierge employee responded and said he was sending the correct forms. Well, the forms were basically identical, only asking for credit card information. There was one slight difference - at the top of one form it said ""Price Per Person."" This was ambiguous and did not help me in filling out the information about what I wanted in the room. So I emailed back and said this still doesn't help me, there's no place to indicate what I want, it's just asking for payment. Nevermind. I never heard back.I wasn't baiting them---but I was frustrated and wanted them to know. I shouldn't have to ask a third time, especially from a hotel with such a good reputation. A good hotel should reach out and offer help. So while we were staying there, I went up to one of the gentlemen behind the check-in counter to inquire about it. As I'm describing what happened he says, ""Oh yeah....you're the one who said nevermind, right?"" What???? He wasn't rude - but the way he said it was like, ""Yeah, I heard about you."" How did he know? Were people talking about it? Completely unprofessional. Not only did he act like he could have cared less, but when he pulled the forms up on his computer, told me they were different. I said, show me where. He noted the ""price per person"" line and then told me that's where I should have written what I wanted. I told him that makes no sense. He basically said ""sorry"" but without much interest and barely made eye contact with me the entire conversation. The room was fine, housekeeping was good, restaurant and bar service very good. If not for the special request mess, I'd come back. But I won't -- there are too many other good options in the city."
"Once again the Swissotel delivers a relaxing weekend getaway. I was in a luxurious suite (with two bathrooms) for my stay. The bathroom had a huge soaker tub and two robes. The king size bed was very comfortable and had nice full pillows. I went to Geneva Restaurant for the breakfast buffet. It was a bit pricey but had a lot of options to choose from. Everything was fresh and tasty. I also ordered in room dining around 10pm from Geneva Restaurant. I ordered the filet MR and it came with a double stuffed potato, mushrooms, and a demi glaze sauce. It was delicious and the gentleman who delivered the meal was very professional. I really enjoyed my stay and that's why I always return. I love the luxurious rooms and the staff is exceptional. I worked with Angela at the concierge desk and a few others during my stay; everyone made me feel very comfortable and helped me with anything I needed. This hotel is in a great location in downtown Chicago. There is a ton of shopping and architecture to keep you busy during your stay. The blue line to O'Hare and the orange line to Midway are close by for easy transportation in and out of the city. The Swissotel is a great choice!

Green Features: I participated in the linen and towel reuse program. There was a recycling bin in the room."
"I stayed here with my two toddlers and my husband over the 4th of July weekend last year. It was awesome, this is one of the BEST spots to go and stay if you want to walk out the front lobby and get a great show of the fireworks over the city. this is by the river walk so that makes it even more fun. we strolled all night by the water. the hotel was clean and comfortable and the staff was helpful and kind. the beds were co comfy as well :) we had a lovely view of the river out our room window. the parking is expensive. we paid 65 bucks a night for that. that was the only downside

"My husband and I stayed here on a 24 hour trip from the 'burbs. The hotel is in a good location, although ironically most of what we did was near Wabash and Hubbard. Still, not too far of a walk. The hotel was really empty! Not at all near capacity so we got a nice king corner room package. The $230 package included 2 buffet tickets at the hotel restaurant, and tickets to the Field Museum. The bed was really comfy, the room large, the view awesome, the package a good price. Here's the weird stuff: - since there are not many people at the hotel they make the buffet food as you order it, it was really confusing! But we did get comp'd the $74 (!!) for brunch. There were only about 3 other people in the restaurant (on a Saturday) too. - when we picked up our tickets for the museum we were given a total of two tickets. Turns out there should have been main entrance tickets and multiple special exhibit tickets. We had no idea until the ticket takers asked us where our other tickets were. It was all good - the tickets said Swissotel on them so they let us in. Worth the stay, just a few odd things."
"Started out fabulous! Room was upgraded from a king suite to the Presidential suite on the 41st floor overlooking Navy Pier (perfect for viewing fireworks)! Kudos to Raquel the front desk rep who was absolutely fabulous! Things started to go downhill when Barney Fifer continued to harass us stating multiple noise complaints! We only had 6 people in our suite watching fireworks! If you wanted to get some rest on New Years Eve with a Two year old why check in to a Downtown Chicago hotel on New Year's Eve....or why would the Swissotel place a family who wants to sleep next to the Presidential Suite! We we're told not to use the Bose system that's in the suite! Why put a system like that if guests can't use it! Just stupid! Overall the stag would have been better if the Swissotel would have planned properly and not placed a family who wants to sleep next to the Presidential suite on New Years Eve, that would have eliminated Barney Fifer and his crew from harassing me and my guests! We we're only watching fireworks, listening to House Music and mingling with 5 other guests on New Years Eve but it was ruined thanks Swissotel! Stella did give me a $60 credit! But the evening was still ruined"
We have stayed at the Swissotel in Chicago many times and always enjoy it. It is a beautiful hotel with a beautiful location. It is located on the Chicago River with some rooms that have a wonderful view of Lake Michigan and Navy Pier. The Palm restaurant has delicious food and the breakfast buffet has a seemingly unlimited amount of choices. The rooms are very clean and well laid out and the staff has always been very friendly and accommodating.
"I book to Swissotel Chicago for the New Year 2015 for my family and my friend's family. We booked over the internet and called over the phone to make sure we get what we want. We booked it Thanksgiving Day. We posed extra for the above 12 floor. The Lakeview comes with the room price. We called and ask if we can have adjacent rooms as we have kids. Because of the layout of the hotel, we can only have one room with 2 beds and the other has yo be one king bed to have the room adjacent. So we took it even if we need 2 beds for both rooms. 3 days before the date of reservation, I called to confirm. The morning of check-in I called to confirm. When we checked in, my friend is in the 29th floor and me on the 30th floor. Room 2903 and 3002. I talked to the manager, she said sorry we are booked. They offer to move us 29th floor not Lakeview with 2 beds or a roller bed in the same room( there is barely room for the roller bed) She said that they have to accommodate people's requests. Looks like my Asian last name does not qualify to the people she is referring to. And oh, we only can even see half of the fire works. So, this is not a hotel for that purpose. The pool close at 6 pm. So the kids had to wake up early to swim. WiFi, you have to pay. Parking, even if it says free parking available, it actually cost $65.00/ night. And there is not really much extraordinary about the hotel. Do not be deceived with the pictures they post. The bubbles hanging is the only thing nice to look at. And when somebody next room uses the hair dryer, you can hear it in your room. A good alarm clock if that's what you need."
"A resident of one of Chicago's western suburbs, my wife and I make it a point to visit the city several times during the year. These visits typically include an overnight or weekend stay. Over the years, we have had the pleasure of stay at several of the city's nicer hotels. We discovered the Swissotel Chicago a few years ago and it quickly became out go-to hotel for our city visits.The hotel's location is perfect for us...centrally located and within walking distance to our favorite areas of the city, Millennium Park, Michigan Avenue, and Navy Pier. We love the overall decor and feel of the hotel and the rooms are large and very comfortable. We have also always found the staff extremely friendly and helpful. I have also found it difficult to beat the room rates.A word of caution for those driving to the hotel. Do not rely solely on GPS. Based on my experience, GPS will direct you to use Lower Wacker Drive. Taking this route, at some point you will lose your connection. Unless you are prepared or are familiar with the Drive, you run the risk of missing the correct exit. You may want to try one of the other easy alternative routes which avoid the Lower Wacker. Also, don't have parking sticker shock. On our last visit, it cost $62 to valet. This is comparable to other city hotel parking, though...and about equal cost of a couple train tickets and cab rides to and from the train station."
"Swissotel is a wonderful addition to your travels. The staff is professional, the rooms are comfortable and accomodating to your needs. The Chicago location is in an area with great views of the city but in a quiet location so you get a nice, restful sleep. The only drawback on our stay was the very strong smell of smoke of our floor when we returned to our room. Whomever was smoking (rudely so) on our floor inconvenienced other paying guests who were promised a smoke-free environment.We felt it was too late to call the front desk(after 1:30 AM) but we were not happy with the odor.Otherwise it was a very pleasant experience. The breakfast selections at the Geneva Restaurant are phenomenal. (Also, it would be nice to get our car out in front instead of heading down to the garage, if possible)."
"We stayed at the Swissotel Chicago for 4 nights beginning on Christmas Eve afternoon. The building is beautiful, the gym and pool are above par, and housekeeping and operator (front desk help) were very good. Because I read reviews on this site, I joined their rewards program and had WiFi free of charge. Front desk was efficient, but not overly friendly. My biggest complaint was lack of amenities in room. I don't know if it's considered ""low brow"" or too American to provide coffee makers in the room, but even in budget hotels, this is provided. If Swissotel does not believe in coffee makers for guests, a general complementary coffee bar would be greatly appreciated. For off-site dining and coffee check out Eggys and Marianos, both right behind Swissotel. Not super close, but probably a 5 minute walk, and budget friendly.


Room Tip: Choose a higher floor and ask for a river or lake view.

"Took my two boys (young teens) to Chicago for the day - this hotel was perfect for us. Easy walking to Michigan Ave and the shops, easy driving to Shedd Aquarium. Doormen were super helpful, as was the valet. Parking was pricey (as everywhere in Chi), but there was 24 hr valet service, and you only needed 15 min notice to get your car. Elevators were great in that you put your floor number in BEFORE entering the elevator car - made things super fast. Fitness center and pool/sauna - LOVED. Beautiful views from the Fitness center that made the treadmill easier to be on! Rooms were super clean - loved the nightlight feature of the bathroom fixtures. Beds were only doubles (not queen-sized) which is getting to be more of a negative the older the kids get. Our room overlooked the river and Michigan avenue. Fabulous!!! Hotel was updated throughout. Loved the fruit-flavored water in the lobby. Good time to visit, too, since it was pretty quiet throughout (not a creature was stirring....).


Room Tip: Rooms overlooking the river have a beautiful view!!!

"We booked five rooms for my family to attend a wedding being held at the Swissotel. My sister also booked three rooms to attend the same wedding with her family. The hotel is beautiful with breathtaking views of Navy Pier. My family and my sister's family were all speding money to travel to the wedding so we wanted to incur the expense of the hotel rooms as a gift for them. I expressed that desire when I booked the hotel rooms by telephone. I asked them if I needed to book the rooms all in my name as I was paying for them and they assured me that would not be necessary nor encouraged. My brother-in-law also had a lengthy conversation with the hotel personnel when he booked the rooms for his family and was also paying for a room for my nephew and his wife to stay (as an anniversary gift for them) the night before the wedding. My brother-in-law and I booked each room with the name of each of our sons plus their spouse, etc. I physically went to the lobby to check in with my two oldest sons and they ran my credit card information (although I was told when I booked the rooms, I would not need to be present). My third son was running late and so I asked if I could just check in for him and I was told I could. They ran my credit card for a third time and informed me he would only need to show an ID at any desk and would be given his keys. My sister had a similar experience, however, her one son checked in a day before so it was a reverse situation. Both my youngest son, who checked in without my presence, and my sister's son, who checked in before they arrived, were charged for the rooms. They asked both our sons for not only an ID but for a credit card for incidentials - neither one knew they would automatically charge $100 per room per day as they were not the ones who booked the rooms. My son was only charged the $100. My nephew was charged for both nights of the hotel stay plus $200 in automatic incidentals fees. My nephew didn't realize they were charging almost $500 on his debit card. Both my sister and I asked in advance, if we could pay for these rooms without any cost being attributed to our children and both of us were told there would be no problem. This is a beautiful hotel and the food for the wedding reception was outstanding. I would recommend this hotel for someone who is expecting to pay for their own room, but if you want to do a kindness for someone else by making a hotel experience a gift, I would find somewhere else to stay.

"We thoroughly enjoyed our stay. This was my first stay at the Swissotel Chicago. I have stayed at the Swissotel Shanghai and both locations are fantastic. We had the Lifestyle Suite on the 35th floor, the views alone were priceless. I am a SwissCiircle member so internet and bottled water in the room were complimentary. The location is perfect for shopping, dining, and sightseeing.


Room Tip: Request a corner room they have the best views.

Enjoyed my stay at this hotel last year but poor experience this year. Good location close to shops and restaurants. Comfortable beds but toilet grubby and towels frayed (one blood stained) and worn. Strong smell of bleach. No coffee making facilities. TV remote difficult to work. Bottle water in room $8. Fridge not working. Conference in hotel who took over bar area. Made to feel you were intruding. Staff Christmas dance on and bar area closed. Wanted a nightcap but out of luck.On morning of departure we went downstairs to enter the passageway to shops to find carpets being ripped up and our feet sticking to the glue. No warning of work in progress. Staff only spoke to us when checking in and out were very polite but out otherwise ignored.Found it cold and impersonal.Would not stay again.
"Great location. A few blocks from the Mag Mile, Navy Pier and Millenium Park. I love the fact that all rooms here have a city view or lake view. There are many dining options, most are breakfast items. There's a convenience store right around the corner. They also have a mini-Mart inside of the hotel where you can purchase travel sized essential toiletries (a little overpriced, but you can consider it convenience tax). The beds are extremely comfortable."
"Stayed a long weekend and we found the Swissotel to be comfortable, conveniently located to downtown and in our room, QUIET.It was mostly a shopping weekend for the wife so we were able to walk from the hotel to Michigan Ave. NegativesA couple bottles of water would have been good in the room, but you have to pay 8$per bottle in room.I did not like the glass top on the desk as it was impossible to use your mouse when using your laptop. The TV remote was difficult to use. Had to press the buttons very hard to change a channel and placing a channel menu in the room would be nice so you know what's what on the TV without surfing.PositivesLoved the shower water, for some reason the water was not as hard as in most hotels, wasn't soft but not nearly as hard.Room had great blinds and was QUIET, huge plus.Fridge in room that I did not see on the web site but glad it was there.Bed was super comfortable.Overall, very nice and we'll be back

Green Features: They offered a 10 coupon for those that chose to not have their rooms cleans off food and beverage. Nice touch although we did not have the room cleaned we did not take advantage of the coupon."
"In the past, whenever we have arrived here by car, we were immediately greeted by one of several doorman. My wife's door was always opened for her and our baggage was removed from the trunk. Respect and politeness were always the orders of the day. Not anymore by a long shot. We recently pulled in, were kind of ordered to park "" over here"". No one opened my wife's car door and I lugged the baggage out of the trunk myself. Not a big deal for me but we both felt like the caring was definitely gone. The same thing happened when we left the next day. The bellman didn't really want to get our car delivered to the front but rather we should go to the basement and get it ourselves. When it arrived, they parked it away from the front door and no offer was made to open any doors, lift the luggage or even say anything...except to take our tip. I can take the rudeness but shame on you for not respecting my wife!We had checked in ""in advance"" on the computer, before we left, as an email from the hotel suggested we do to make check-in a breeze. We had made reservations six months in advance and requested one of several rooms we have had before. We were told this would not be a problem for Swiss Club members such as ourselves.Advance email check-in meant nothing we soon found out. We told them we'd be there at 1:00 pm and arrived at 1:10 pm. ""Sorry, not only are the rooms you requested not available and won't be, but no rooms would be available for 2-3 hours!! "" ""Just have a seat in the bar or go shopping and check back after 2 hours"" Oh yes, there would be a room or two available immediately, but not the kind we wanted. So we waited for two hours and finally a room became available. Turned out to be an excellent room and we were happy. We just wish they wouldn't offer fancy emails etc. to ""save you time"" and make promises they can't keep. We also wish they would bring back the previous check-in personnel who always made you feel very welcome and had a particular charm about themselves. This time we felt we were just checking into a hotel and they were neither happy nor upset that we were there. We were just plain old people....but they were quite willing to take your money!Check out result in a double billing for a $67 over night parking charge. They suggested we had brought two cars and parked both. Another feeling like we were just people they needed to move on. We worked out the credit but this kind of thing should never happen at this hotel.On the bright side, Troy, the bar tender was perfect. Fun to talk to, knew his wines and other drinks, and truly went out of his way to make you feel welcome. Way to go Troy! You could teach the front desk and bellmen how to treat people and how to welcome guests.Also, another plus is their excellent breakfast offering and the people who wait on you. Very nice and they too have always made us feel welcome. They even remembered us from our last visit.As a foot note, we suspect that our treatment was the result of driving our much older car in ( 2002 Toyota Avalon and not our new Avalon) and being dressed in just plain older clothes instead of or more dressy ones, just may have played a role in how we were treated. I hope not but it sure seems to fit.


Room Tip: Try to get a corner room that faces the river, the downtown and the Navy Pier.

"Arrived at Swissotel Chicago for a Holiday play and shopping on the Mag Mile. Location was perfect for both the shopping district and theater district. The hotel itself was spectacular and we secured a fine deal for the 2 rooms which are very modern and well appointed. Check in/out was very efficient and courteous. We enjoyed our stay at the Swissotel Chicago.


Room Tip: upper floor views are spectacular

"The Swiss Hotel is located close enough to Mag Mile but away from the congestion of traffic and thus is a great stay for business or pleasure. The rooms are modern and above average in size. Have all the typical amenities expected in a full service hotel. Note the parking cost and the extra cost for WiFi in the room. The hotel food is comparable to the other hotels in the category ie Westin.There is a good steak restaurant (Palm Restaurant) adjoining the lobby, I think the Swiss Hotel has a great staff, especially the front desk. Always had a great experience whenever I am in Chicago."
"Our stay at this hotel was unique in a few ways. One, the elevators do not have numbers on the inside of the car - you have to ask for an elevator by floor and it will assign one to you. This is difficult if you get the number wrong or change your mind about which floor you want to go to. Second, they have a green option that gives you a $10 per day credit for food if you forgo housekeeping. However, you need to ask for this at checkin or hang the correct sign on your door the first day - the do not disturb sign will not get you this credit. Next, there is a charge for internet but you can get free internet by signing up for a special plan which is free at checkin. I'm not sure what the purpose of this is since I'm sure everyone does it but oh well. We had a corner room with guaranteed view. I suggest you ask for the North corner as we had the SW corner and the view was limited - you had to stand at the window to see the river or lake. Otherwise it was nice and clean. I did a spa treatment which was lovely ansd I recommend it. The best part of our stay was dining at the Palm - fabulous! And they do a great job getting you a taxi out front. While this is not a 5star hotel it is nice and I would stay here again with the above mentioned things in mind.

"LOVED the Swissotel in Chicago. The place was beautiful and the staff incredibly kind and accommodating. The hotel is in the center of everything so this is the location you want. We used valet parking at the front door of the hotel but booked it on-line prior to our visit and a much discounted price. I also got a heck of a deal booking the hotel on-line.The interior is sleek but warm and welcoming. The bed was AWESOME, beautiful room with beautiful view and huge bathroom. The fitness room, pool and hot tub had long hours at no extra charge - very nice.I'd stay there again and again!


Green Features: request towel only service and they give you a $5 per day credit to use in hotel dining/."
"I stayed 3 nights in Nov. The place is pricey but you get fantastic service. Housekeeping in particular was superb. The room was immaculate and toiletries were replenished daily. The hotel also takes security seriously, which I appreciated. I came back while the lady was cleaning the room and she even asked me to scan my key card. The attention to detail and training was apparent in everyone that I interacted with at the hotel and I'd certainly stay again."
"My partner and I decided to go check out Chicago for a long weekend back in Chicago. The front desk attendant was super. She saw that my partner was French and began to speak to him fluently. Come to find out she grew up less than an hour from where he lives. We got a higher floor room facing Lake Michigan with views of the Chicago River. Awesome view! The room was comfortable and spacious with a nice bed and roomy bathroom. Our only issue, although it's kind of funny looking back at it now is that when we got our room key pass and went into our room, there was an interesting skunk-y smell (I'll leave you to guess what this was) when we opened the door and as we walked in, I saw that the room was already occupied. We shouted ""We're sorry"" just in case someone was in there and ran out and shut the door. I guess this might have ruined the experience for some but it really did't bother us. The front staff was very apologetic although it would have been nice to get an upgrade for our embarrassment :-P

"I stayed in this hotel at the end of August this year. I thought I'd give it a few months before writing a review to see if my feelings towards the hotel improved but they haven't. The wifi is ridiculously expensive and I was certain it was advertised as a hotel with free wifi on a well known last-minute style hotel booking website I used. Shortly after I stupidly paid the $25 or so fee for 24hours access, it went down and didn't come back up again. I called a few hours later to ask why it wasn't working, and was told ""we will have an engineer here in the morning"".The hotel is in a nice location and the rooms are great, as are the facilities, so it's a shame something like charging for wifi means I will not stay here again. It's 2014 - even coffee shops have free wifi these days.

"Was there for 4 days, and everything was very good, I am not a fan of paid wifi, but sometimes it does helps you to forget about the social media.Location its quite good, you have views of the river, about 4 blocks away from the Millienium Park, and probably around 5 min, to the Soldier Field.Rooms have enough space, room has a safe, an umbrella just in case you need it but just keep in mid its not for free, theres a parking fee, keep in mind that you might not need the car (if you are from out of the country). Next time Im in town, I would go back, for sure, such and amazing stay at this hotel !!"
"Our dealings with the front desk made the hotel seem rather forbidding. They seem to have to deal with a huge volume of guests andthere always seemed to be a queue. It's a popular conference venue so there always seemed to be a huge volume of traffic through the foyer and around the entrance. It's certainly not calming. The foyer isn't the most welcoming or inviting of places to be honest. Our room, on an upper floor however, was large, very comfortable and secluded. The hotel is very centrally located, and very convenient for the sights and shopping. The pricing regime is a tad cynical, but not wholly unusual in some US hotels. As far as I recall, if you want an upper floor or a lake view,the price rockets beyond what seems reasonable. Fair enough but do check it out before booking. We're fans of Swissotel and are regular guests with them elsewhere, but we tried the JW Marriott on our most recent stopover and found it a much better place to stay for a similar price.


Room Tip: upper floor, facing the lake, but add-ons and specials such as these attract a huge premium.

"I stayed several nights at the Swissotel The experience was as positive the last day as the first. I found the staff to be gracious and helpful with every encounter each day, including the front desk, waitstaff, housekeeping and the managing staff. Amy H was especially helpful and even remembered my name after the first day! I was impressed. My room had an amazing view of the lake, navy pier and downtown. I will try to upload a night time photo. My room and bed were very comfortable; lots of outlets at desk and bedside table level. I had room service - great service and very good food. I ate at the lobby lounge. Do try the fried avocado - sublime, seriously. I left two of my favorite sweaters in a drawer and i received them at home a few days later. I had a long and high pressure meeting. My room at the Swissotel was my oasis! Thanks to all of you there.

"Swissotel is a modern hotel conveniently located a few blocks from Michigan. The hotel has nice views of the water and Navy Pier. The gym was nicely equipped and offers fabulous waterviews from the 42nd floor.I was just surprised the hotel does not provide free Wifi at least in the lobby nor provides coffee or water in the rooms.

"Stayed here for business - staff was helpful and polite. Very chic hotel. Room was nice, but housekeeping was missing the basics like dusting light fixtures, pictures, etc. Bathroom floor was cracked, obviously coming from the shower door that didn't close thoroughly. Had trouble maintaining a comfortable room temperature at night. Great view of the city and the lake. Bar downstairs had great cocktails and shared plates. Breakfast was yummy - but pricey. Overall, I'd recommend -- but paying for wi-fi, come on now - I've stayed in lesser hotels that didn't price gouge for wifi.


Room Tip: All rooms have fantastic views -- and the higher up you go, the better your view.

"Had a room at 28th floor, with astonishing view on downtown and river, and at the far end the lake. Bed quite comfortable. Location is really great !!Enjoyed the entertainment system, 42 inch screen (as many US hotels offer), could browse all the latest and greatest movies. Although offering an innovative centralized elevator calling system, waiting time for elevators was quite long in many cases... Not sure there is improvement to traditional approaches."
"Rooms were sparkling clean, roomy and lovely. Hotel has beautiful views of Chicago and located near Grant Park and the Mag. Mile. We were able to check in early. Service was great. Parking is expensive but if you need to park and leave your car their are other lots nearby that are more moderately priced. Checkout Parkwhiz for deals and lots close to the hotel. Got this room via Priceline at an excellent price."
"The Swissotel is very good .Was staying in a suite , so no complaints . Room was super clean , modern and view outside was magnificient . Stayed on a higher floor . Even the lobby and areas outside the room were clean and well maintained . Staff are very nice , helpful . Food was great , but breakfast and room service was pricey , So didn't eat much at the restaurants , also the internet felt slow . However the location of the hotel is excellent , a little walking distance to all the touristy spots . Also the area around the hotel is very beautiful , clean and felt safe . Will definately visit again ."
"This was the first time I've stayed at a Swissotel, and I can't wait to go back. After walking from Union Station - which wasn't the best decision, but that's what my partner wanted to do - stepping into Swissotel was a transition into comfort and luxury. At checkin, my room was upgraded to a suite on the 40th floor with an AMAZING view of the city. The front desk staff was helpful and courteous. I didn't go down to the bar, but my partner did. He said the people working and drinking there were pretty chill. We went swimming, too. The pool is nice but there were lots of kids, so maybe it could have been relaxing at another time but at 9:30 p.m. on a Friday night it was pretty noisy. I also did research on ""green"" hotels before I booked, and the Swissotel sustainability plan is impressive. Super comfy bed. I loved the products in the bathroom. Overall, this is a pretty ballin' hotel!"
"Great location right on the river. The hotel was as expected. Quick check in, knowledgeable and friendly staff. My room was on the 25th floor and had an incredible view of the sailboats moored on the lake. The bed and pillows were dreamy. The bathroom was large, well stocked with fluffy towels and toiletries. They also have a well stocked 24/7 store in the lobby which has snack and water. It was a quick work trip and met all my needs. I would definitely stay here again."
"Such a great location - our upgraded corner suite offered an absolutely breathtaking view of both the city, Navy Pier, and the sunrise over the lake, as well as a gorgeous little peek-through of Millennium Park. The immediate area is quiet and easily accessible. Check-in experience was lovely but the suite we upgraded to was found with leftover garbage and food from the previous guest (food was rotten in the fridge, so it had been there for a few days at least). We called down to ask for an audio cable to be able to use the BOSE-system in the room and sadly, no one was able to help.Turndown service was a nice touch and housekeeping did a great job every day. Bed was unbelievably comfortable. Would stay again with a few minor tweaks.


Room Tip: Rooms on the higher floors have stunning views. Worth the extra elevator trip.

"Stayed on Michigan Avenue previously but this location is far better, the best of both worlds with stunning views of the River, the Lake, the Millenium Fountain (which sprays across the river every hour on the hour) and the Navy Pier plus all the shopping you could wish for a ten minute walk away. Stunning room, first class fixtures and fittings, beautiful bathroom. Only one snag with the room the safe did not work and when a guy came to check it out he found the batteries had been stolen. He came back with batteries and left but there was not battery cover so we ended up holding the batteries in with cellotape. Only a small issue but maybe this should be part of the room check when servicing following a check out.


Room Tip: Highly recommend a room with a lake/river view an ever changing scene with boat traffic all day long...

"My fiance and I love to stay at this hotel when we just need to get away for the weekend. You do have to pay for the fitness center and the pool if you are not a member of their rewards club, which is free. Quick fix. This hotel is a quick walk over the bridge to all the main shopping and not far from most major attractions, and, most importantly to us, is not located in a noisy area. The rooms are comfortable and the bathtubs are large. This place always makes us happy."
"The location of Swissotel is its absolute plus, walkin distance to lots of things. Room was big and clean, very good service.Thank god we came by plane and not by car as the garage is ridiculous expensive for guests.Check in and out worked well, concierge and all stuff really friendly.Pool in the last floor is a bit small and lacking the view, especially as it is in the last floor.Strange was that there was no coffee making facility in the room, we had that so far in really all hotels in the states even in ways cheaper ones.Hotel can be recommended without doubts."
"Arrived with a great deal of luggage. No assistance offered..... Moved inside hotel to be greeted by what looked like a row of small airline checkin desks. Found someone to check us in who was not particularly friendly. Got ourselves up to our room (still no offer of assistance) which was very nice. The lifts are super electronic which at first puts you a bit off balance but is ok by the time you leave! Breakfast was good and our server, David, was lovely. Second morning we had a different server who was verging on rude. So service is unreliable. Location of hotel is excellent. But there are a few service-related issues which really should be addressed."
"We truly enjoyed our stay at Swissotel. There is, honestly, nothing extraordinary about this hotel, except one thing... the view. I booked this hotel, for my husband and I, for our stay during the IMTS show, after our first, second and third choice hotels were all booked. I knew nothing about the hotel, but it seemed to have a good location, on the river, right off Michigan Ave. I saw that corner rooms were available, and having had good look in the past with the views from corner rooms in other hotels, booked it. We were shocked into giddiness when we walked into our room, on the 22nd floor, and saw the spectacular view we had! Because the hotel is a triangular shape, a corner room has an extreme angle from one side to the other. To the left, we could see all the way to the Trump Building and down the Chicago River towards the Corn Cob Buildings and the Sears Tower, and to the right we could see the full view of the lake and the Navy Pier... and more of the Chicago River between the points. At night, the lights were spectacular. The windows were huge all the way around, so the light just filled our room during the day. We felt like we were living in a glass house. One morning we woke up to a rainy, stormy day and it was really fun! It really gave you the true Chicago experience. I don't believe the corner room was much more in cost than any other room, as well. But, if you request a corner room, be sure and ask for the corner that overlooks the river to the left and the lake to the right. (There are 3 corners, of course!!) One corner overlooks Millennium Park and the lake, and one looks over to a not so attractive side of the city. Also, be sure and ask for a high floor.The Lobby was very nice with a lovely bar, and good appetizers. The elevators were speedy and never had to wait very long, even though the hotel was full, as there were many of them. The concierge was helpful, as well. We had lunch at The Palm the first afternoon, and was not too impressed, so we did not eat there again. We had room service one night when we were too pooped to go out, and had a great dinner of pizza and a specialty salad that we shared. As well, we had a great breakfast in our room but after the really high cost of breakfast (almost $100 for 2) we did not do that again. It really is shameful the way hotels (most all hotels, not just Swissotel) charge outrageous prices for room service, especially breakfast. I feel like they really take advantage of tired travelers... the fees tacked on for delivery, as well as the food charges themselves, feels like price gouging. But, alas... Will definitely stay here when we come back for IMTS again in 2016!

"The toilet would not flush all week, because the chain was disconnected. I reported this to the help desk, concierge, and other staff numerous times. The technician used a plunger each time, but the water would not refill. On the last night, a different technician said, ""OH!"" He attached the chain and it worked properly. It was very inconvenient to use the other restrooms in the hotel during my stay.The conference food and service was very good and servers were attentive.The conference audio/visual technician was knowledgeable and attentive.The head of my bed was immediately next to the elevator shaft. It made annoying noises all night, the first night I assumed it was a subway nearby.The fitness room and pool are beautiful, well maintained and a tremendous view."
"When we arrived, it was sooooo hot in our room. The air conditioner was not working. When I called, the guy took the filter out and it was disgusting!!! Looked like it hadn't been changed in months. After he left, I wanted to take a nap after a long drive. Someone came to the door. It was a different repair man. He said he was there to fix the air conditioner. I told him someone had already been by. The guy said ""oh, ok. sorry, they didn't tell me."" the toilet didn't flush well and it kept running and running. the light switch in the bathroom was falling off of the wall. i went to buy a soft drink at the front desk. as i was standing in line, no one even looked up and acknowledged me. i stepped over to the bar to see if i could pay for it there and the bartender was so rude. you could tell he didn't want to be bothered by me. it hotel was nice, but not over the top fancy. for $380 per night, i thought it would blow us away. they fell very short."

"If you're having a family event or romantic occasion, I would not recommend this hotel. I believe this hotel is best suited for business travelers attending conferences because hospitality and customer service is a secondary priority at this property. None of the employees seemed particularly happy or welcoming, which makes me wonder how they are trained and/or treated themselves. There is a very impersonal atmosphere to this property, which I would describe as cold and business-like. Swissotel is not a particularly special property: while some of the design elements are cool, the rooms are too sparse with low ceilings. There is no coffee maker in the room, which is also by design: it forces you to order room service for a $17 pot of coffee! Ironically, the layout of the hotel is in the form of a triangle, so ""corners"" are a definite theme here. I just don't like feeling ""cornered"" into paying exorbitant amounts for things that should already be included at a better property. The hotel is located in a fantastic neighborhood. The neighborhood is quiet and does not have a manic vibe (unlike the frenetic Michigan Avenue) and very close to everything. There's a lovely view of the Chicago River and Navy Pier, and quite a good view of downtown & the Wrigley building. A Mariano's is to the South, which is an upscale fresh market.If management from Swissotel is reading this review please know that minor things like having ability to make a complimentary coffee in one's room and take a complimentary swim do matter to guests. Friendliness also matters! It IS the hospitality industry after all. I do not expect fawning attention or over-the-top cheesy friendliness, which we can all agree is disingenuous. But a smile here or there and a happy-to-help-you attitude from staff goes a long way! Cutting corners to make an extra buck from guests leave them feeling that they have not experienced hospitality at all. If you think your guests are not special they will also leave feeling that your property is nothing special either.

"We booked our reservation ""blindly"" through Hotwire.com for an amazing price. We had a room on the 16th floor and views of the Navy Pier were spectacular. The check-in was quick and when we requested a room on the higher floors the front desk agent was more than happy to accomodate. Rooms are large modern and shiek. Bathroom boasts a large tub and a separate glass shower. Lots of space for a family of 4. Wifi, Gym and pool now included, if you sign up for their Swissotel Circle card in advance of your stay. It's free and only takes a few minutes to register online. Gym supplied panoramic 42nd-floor views, updated equipment and an indoor pool. Hotel was walking distance to Magnifient Mile. Taxi's always available at the front of the hotel or a ten minute walk to State/Lake subway station. We did not take part in the hotel restaurants but I have eaten at the Palm restaurant in Las Vegas and the food is something to brag about. As it was the Hockey Playoff season during our visit, we did enjoy time at the hotel bar to watch the games. The drinks, while a little pricy, were very tasty.

"This is a first class hotel beginning when you step up to the reception. Our experience was with a super exceptional receptionist named ""Chenge."" Sorry if I slightly misspelled it.He was so friendly and willing to assist us with any of our needs. He remembered our names each time we passed through the lobby. My husband and I were there as the beginning of a Pullman Train Journey on the ""City of New Orleans.""We were given an exceptional room as I'm sure most of them are. The room was beautiful, clean, tastefully decorated. Every detail was special and quite memorable.Thanks to the management for their excellent job and a special thanks to ""Chenge."""
"We were looking for a hotel with a pool and close to Michigan Ave. Location was difficult if you're planning on walking the Mag Mile. The first room smelled of smoke and my wife's hand swelled up within minutes of checking in. Toilet seat also had stains so we asked for a different room. Front desk put us in a different room but was indifferent with little apology. The pool was serviceable, but the hot tub was disgusting. We hurriedly got out after seeing what looked liked mold in numerous spots. I would not pay full price for this hotel."
"Check-in was simple, however as soon as you enter the room you are greeted by a musky smell of a dated hotel room that one can only presume had been smoked in many times since the last update of this hotel. The bathrooms have finishes that will never look clean even if they were indeed spotless, thanks in part to the 1990's intimate fascination with the color beige.The desk and tv console are separated from the wall, leaving about a footlong gap from the wall because they couldn't figure out how to get an extension cord back there, and on top of that there are specks of some sort of historic splatter on the wall to the left of the tv. There are no accessible outlets next to the bed, so your cell phone and ipad will have to be plugged in next to the tv on the other side of the room (these things weren't an issue when this hotel room was last updated).I wasn't expecting the Ritz, but this is in no way a four star hotel. On top of the outrageous price they have the audacity to charge for this room, they also will not provide a travel size tube of toothpaste without an additional fee. When I told the concierge that this was not indicative of a luxury hotel, he said my other option was to wait for the CVS to open at 7am.Thoroughly unimpressed, and I'm very glad there are only one of these atrocities in the United States."
"The hotel staff gave me a friendly and adequate greeting when I arrived to the Swissotel. The hotel is in a great location - across the river from the mag mile and is a ten minute walk from State/lake subway station (go north and east when you come out of the subway). It is a 5 minute walk from millenium park and from the greatest breakfast place Wildberry pancakes on Randolph street. The first thing you will notice is that the elevators are very strange - you will have to key what floor you want to go to and it will direct you to the elevator that will take you there. This is great when you are the only person trying to get into an elevator but becomes problematic when there are many tourists who can't speak english and don't know what is going on. I had several people ride with me in the elevator thinking it will take them to their floors erroenously. I was trying to give them hand signals on what they had to do! The elevator was also excruciatingly slow in the mornings as it was trying to pick up people on every floor - you would be hoping that because it is computer programmed it would know not to stop on more than 10+ floors because it can't hold that any people! Otherwise the rooms were clean, modern and the beds were quite comfortable. I enjoyed the glass shower and separate tub. I would have to warn you though if you are a big person you will not get into the shower. Wifi is extra."
"Waited 45 minutes to check in. Hotel refused to provide me with an itemization for in-room-services. But, freely charged my credit card, for more than I had expected. And, I believe that I should get an explanation, a true itemization, but the person didn't get back to me, when they claimed they would. Beware, terrible customer service. Also, we were ignored at the lobby bar. I had to request service. it felt more like an overpriced 2.5 star hotel."
"Love the swissotel. Great atmosphere, great location, and great views! We came to Chicago on a busy weekend which meant the hotels were all pricy and nearly booked. I stayed at the swiss before and that was the first one I suggested. Sure enough it was reasonably priced in comparison to other hotels and they had rooms available. It had been awhile since I last stayed so I hoped the quality would be the same. The quality surpassed my memories and we had a wonderful stay. The room was perfect,comfy, and classy. We will return!!"
Beautiful view of canal and Navy Pier - Close to both the Pier and the Magnificent Mile. Decor was simple and understated. Beds were very comfortable and the Baths were nicely appointed. Starbucks could be purchased in the lobby bar. Great valet service/porter.Negatives:No coffee/tea in the guest roomsConcierge was unable to adequately help us order food late one the evenings of our stay.Parking was $65 a night?!?! Room was very warm even with the thermostat set at 68 degrees.Pool was very small and completely over crowded
"Overall, our stay at Swissotel was great. The hotel was very clean and modern. We stayed on the 7th floor. The view was ok, couldn't see much but we were barely in our room so that wasn't a priority for us. My only complaints are the extreme cost to park overnight for guests. $65?? Really? Also, it would have been nice to have coffee in our room instead of having to go down to the lobby in the morning and PAY for it. Even a Holiday Inn has coffee in the room. A 4 star hotel like Swiss can't accommodate coffee? Was disappointed in that. Would like to know WHY coffee is not offered in the rooms. But we were very impressed with the staff. They were very friendly, quick service, and respectful. We were able to check in very early the morning we arrived even though our check in was at 3pm. That really helped our schedule so we appreciated the flexibility there. The beds were very comfy but if there was more than one person sleeping in the same bed, you would find yourself rolling into the middle of the bed.But overall, great experience. I would stay there again."
"The attitude and demeanor of the front desk girls was unacceptable. I have worked for the marriott in the past, and I would never have treated a guest the way I was treated. I would never think of staying at the swisshotel again in my life, and I have made that clear to any friends asking suggestions. The shower created a small flood every time it was used and nothing was done about it. Never again."
"If you are unfamiliar with Chicago & the layout, this is a great hotel that is CLOSE to many things, but slightly off the main drag of the touristy spots. Extremely quiet & clean hotel. That being said, if you hate walking more than 5 blocks, this is not your hotel...or city really. Chicago is very pedestrian friendly & as a resident of the city, this is one of my goto recommendations to friends/coworkers visiting. A few of the other ratings state that it isn't worth the price & there are cheaper options, but typically the Swiss is in line with others in its class. Marriott brands, Kimpton & even the Hilton (which I think is a dump). You are a 10-15 minute walk from River North, Navy Pier & literally 3 minutes from Michigan Ave. If you're lazy, the doorman will call for a cab, which should be $5-10. Maybe $10-15+ if you are going to the museums to the South. But the central location is key to any activity. As for close restaurants, again River North is nearby, but Three Forks (great dinner) & Wildberry (breakfast) are within blocks.

"My husband and I travel to Chicago frequently. This trip was for business. We were delighted with this hotel. Our room was huge. Wonderful view of the river. Huge bathtub. Great location. It was freezing cold outside with snow and we could walk many places underground. So convenient. The fitness center was amazing. I worked out more than usual due to such a nice experience. It is expensive, but so worth the price compared to other hotels."
"I have stayed at this hotel many times, it has always been my go to hotel in Chicago. I recently went on a four day weekend here, was in town for a wedding. The room had a spectacular view and was clean when I got there. The next first night I was there the internet was down, I woke up e next morning to find that I didn't have a coffee maker, I thought maybe they forgot it, I called down and was informed that they no longer provided coffee but I could come downstairs and buy a cup, order room service, or rent a coffee machine. I was shocked, the cost of my four days was 1200.00. I own a hair salon on the north shore of Chicago and when my clients walk through the door I offer them a cup of coffee or some water, or other beverage, they are a guest of my business and am honored they have chosen my business, offering a beverage is a universal symbol of welcome to my home, relax, enjoy. I even noticed you eliminated the complimentary water coolers in the lobby.  The second thing is the opting out of cleaning, I can get your green message as far as the reusing of towels and bed linens, but to not come take the trash, make the bed and wipe the glass counters which dirty from eating and drinking, how are we saving the planet by not emptying a trash can, on the third day I took the green plaque off my door and called down to the front desk that I needed my dirty dishes, coffee cups and garbage picked up, no one ever showed up so I cleaned it myself, found the service entrance in hall borrowed a vac mum and literally cleaned my own room, why would you not want to provide me with clean drinking glasses and take my trash?  The joke at the wedding became "" the hole I was staying at"" they had turned down service and all sorts of amenities for half the price, I have stayed at trump, which by the way was cheaper tonight online than the Swissotel by 75.00, they have Nepresso machines in your room and from the minute you walk into that hotel they are falling all over you to make you happy. The message you have sent to me is that you don't care for me or my stay at your hotel, message received. trump is now my go to hotel and will share this story with everyone of my chicago clients."
"Huge expenses abound as well as no many places to dine nearby. Views are nice. Room though lacks basic things easily found in much cheaper hotels. For the price I expect some basic things. Easy outlets to plug things into, a shower that doesn't have a broken shower head attachment as well as beds that have a a definite divot in it where many people have slept before. Move right or left and it's like you are trying to roll uphill. Room service is way expensive also. Parking at $65 a night is what I actually pay for hotel rooms that beat this place. Except for location I got to to say I am very disappointed in this hotel."
"the hotel could not have been in a better location. Central to all tours and walking distance to the Miracle Mile was great. The room was large and clean, bed very comfortable. Bathroom was great also, had a bathtub and separate shower. All hotel employees were friendly and helpful. We used the Concierge several times. Will stay there again on our next trip to Chicago.

"Excellent Stay. Met with friends for a reunion, and the staff helped us get a suite that accommodated all of us. Hotel was in great shape, in a great location and we had a great time. Parking garage was hard to find, but we called up the hotel and they guided us right to it in minutes. Very good price compared to other hotels. I would highly recommend this for folks staying in downtown Chicago."
"Stayed here for four nights. Good, little pricey hotel with an amazing view on the river and the lake (stayed on 30th floor). Large room with an even larger bathroom. Awesome! European style interior, very clean, extremly comfortable bed. The staff is friendly and helpful. :-/: No free wifi! 15 $for 24h! Not up to date!! Poor! No free drinking water and no free coffee and tea in the room. Unacceptable for a hotel of this category!!"
"Perhaps one of the nicer properties I've stayed in. The club level room was very nice and large. The bathroom was super nice with separate shower, tub, marble and nice toiletries. The pool was large and the gym equipment was plentiful and first class. There is no way this hotel is 50 in rankings. I've stayed at several other properties in Chicago ranked higher that are not near as nice. The breakfast was fantastic with more options than most hotels even think of. The fruit and chocolate covered strawberries really made things special."
"Stayed at the Swissotel for my parent's 50th anniversary. I have a family of four, so we stayed at a lifestyle sweet, which has a bedroom with two beds, a living area with sofa bed and two bathrooms. It was a very spacious suite. Also very clean, quiet and comfortable. My parents and my brothers also enjoyed their stay in different suites. The buffet breakfast that was included in our package was quite nice in the morning. The staff was very responsive and the hotel is in a great location with access to both the Loop and various sites around North Michigan Ave."
"The Swissotel Chicago is a very convenient location to Millenium Park, the river, Navy Pier and the Magnificent Mile. It is a new architectural landmark with stunning views. Our room was very clean, comfortable and contemporary, as was the lobby. The parking attendants were very friendly and helpful, but the parking was rather expensive at $65/night. Access to the pool and exercise equipment is not an extra charge as stated on their website. Internet connection in our room was also supposed to be free of charge, but we were unable to get it working during our stay. We got a great rate through an independant booking site and would stay here again."
"Staying here is like comfort and being pampered all in one. You get the view of the Lake and the style and elegance that makes each guest feel special. You are also in the thick of downtown and energy is amazing. This a hotel with impecable staff. They also gave us great recommendations for breakfast that was within walking distance. I love the pool as it feels like you are just floating in midair as you can see the skyscrapers as you lounge.Makes me yearn to go back.

"Had three great nights at the Swissotel Chicago last week. The room was very clean and spacious with all the necessary amenities. Wifi was very good in every corner of the hotel, computer available to check in for your flight was located in the lobby. The Concierge desk was very helpful with restaurant recommendations. The location of the hotel was fabulous, easy walk to everything. Would definitely return to this hotel on my next visit to Chicago. The only disappointment was that the executive lounge was removed."
"I recently stayed at the Swissotel in Chicago while my husband was on a business trip. The location was fantastic with beautiful views of the river and Miracle Mile and yet close to the Art Institute and all the Loop area has to offer. The hotel room was large, spotless and the bed was a dream. The bathroom was modern, clean and had I loved the artistic mirrors and how the shower adjustment was on the side of the shower you enter rather than under the spray allowing you to adjust water temperature without getting wet. The only drawback of this hotel is that the meal prices are geared to business travellers rather than tourists but then at a hotel like this you get what you pay for!The incident that precipitated my writing this review was the handling of an item I accidentally left in my hotel room. Two week after my stay I realized my error, called the hotel and not only did they still have the item (logged and registered) they immediately took the steps necessary to return my item. All this with courtesy and utmost efficiency! Anthony and Bernardo were especially helpful! Thanks Swissotel!!"
"Booked this through Priceline and got a super deal. This being our second time to Chicago, I was a bit concerned it was a bit far from the Michigan Ave, but we found a short cut that got us to Grant Park pretty quickly. The Hotel is at the end of a street so lacking for food choices, but 5 to 10 minute walk will get you lots of choices.We came with our kids for four days before joining the in-laws in Saugatuck and came during Lalapalooza, security was very tight in the evenings and required your door keys to get elevator access. Plus when we checked in they had a code of conduct for all guests printed out. With the heavy party scene in the air we were pleasantly surprised at how quiet the hotel was! Once again I was disappointed with the lack of free WiFi (if McDonalds can give to their guests with $1 value menu item, why I can't get it at a nice hotel is beyond me) and we only found out on our last day that we had free pool access ... Nothing to write home about, we had more fun renting bikes and hitting all the major beaches.Our check in experience was very special as the gentleman who helped us friended my 5 year old daughter and every time we walked in he shout out to her and ask how his BFF was doing. The staff where excellent and with Lalapalooza over the weekend then Conventioneers the very next day... We had no other issues.I will add we took our 7 & 5 year old to Lalapalooza and the fact that we were much older than our music festival days, I was thrilled to take my kids to pretty awesome event ... Even if they were one of the youngest attendees around :)A standard 4 star Hotel that serves its purpose."
"Just returned from visiting Chicago, found hotel staff to be helpful, location was great, close walking distance to Navy Pier, Michigan Avenue, and Millennium Park. Overall hotel experience was good. Only negative is the over night parking was very expensive. Suggestion that over night guests should be charged less than $65.00 per night!

"Outstanding views and great location. Staff is great. We booked our room through Hotwire at a competitive rate. Our room had views of the Chicago River, Navy Pier, and Lake Michigan. We checked in late after a long drive and had a nice view of fireworks at the Navy Pier when we entered our room. Let me reiterate this...the view from our room was outstanding. The hotel is very clean and crisp. Our room was exceptionally clean and not damp. The workout facility is robust and is on or close to being on the top floor. The negatives we experienced were mattresses that were concave and in need of replacement. I could feel a few coils on one of the beds. The in room internet is spotty at best. There is no coffee maker in the room, which is fine, but typically there would be only one person working the Starbucks coffee counter in the morning. This resulted in long waits for morning coffee 15-20 minutes, as this person is making specialty coffees and serving baked goods. Minor problems that could be easily resolved with customer service, so I can't really knock them for that Overall we were extremely content and didn't bother complaining, but I let them know about the mattresses at check out. I would definitely suggest staying here and I would hesitate to stay anywhere else when I return to Chicago."
"For our yearly visit to Chicago in November, we systematically book this hotel. It lies on walking distance to Michigan Avenue's shops, but it also close to the lake shore and to the open-air theatre. The restaurant at the entrance serves great seafood (largest lobsters around). The lounge bar in the reception area is cosy. Enroll for hotel club membership and you will receive complimentary fitness club access and in-room wifi. What would one possibly want beyond this ?"
"This hotel is a really good place to stay if you want to be right downtown close to the river, Navy Pier, Millennium Park, etc. I stayed here overnight while attending Spring Awakening electronic music festival, which was held at Soldier field (close to the Museum Campus). The walk from hotel to venue certainly wasn't short, but it wasn't bad, either. Millennium Park and such are closer, and there are places to dine and I'm sure there is nightlife in the closer vicinity, as well. The hotel staff were courteous and professional (keep in mind this was a one night stay), and the room was clean (not impeccable), nice decor, and a really nice bathroom. My bathroom had a shower and a separate, larger-than-average jacuzzi-style tub. Overall, a good experience was had with this hotel. Oh -and there are some great views to be had from your hotel window!"
"This hotel is centrally placed and near the river so you can walk to the main spots in the city. Navy pier, Willis tower and the bean were all within a manageable walking distance. After a long day, we ordered room service and it was very efficient and the food was enough to sustain us. The pool was a little shallow however it was clean and the jacuzzi wasn't hot enough but still relaxing. The fitness room was fully equipped and wonderful. We liked the slick building and the staff were very courteous and conversational. The room is large enough to accommodate many. Thanks for a wonderful stay!"
"Stayed here for 3 nights and enjoyed the hotels location, welcome gifts and modern looks. Beds were very comfy but small, excellent river view, separate shower (very small if you are tall) and tub area. Room has a small fridge but no coffee/tea maker. Ordered a pizza from room service and it was horrendous! Tasted like cold, slimy cheese. Check out was a breeze. Valet was a joke!! $65 per night?! Ridiculous!!!"
"The hotel is walking distance to many great destinations and a short cab ride to others. It is impressive, when you first walk in, but that is the lobby. The rooms are decent and mostly clean (although we found some funky stains in the bath room) and you have a little fridge (convenient) and the pool, hot tub, and work out areas are pleasant and well taken care of. Most of the rooms have a nice room too, especially as you go higher up (recommended). However, As another reviewer has already pointed out, the surcharges are outrageous. No coffee, no free wifi, and the room service is crazy pricey. My husband got a very good rate for the rooms, but we quickly realized the cost could escalate wildly. So here are some tips on how to keep costs down.*There is an 'office' area in the lobby if you must get on internet. Although we stayed 3 days, we decided on one night charge and made due with the many hotspots located in the vicinity.*My husband normally brings his own coffee, coffee cup, filters and cone. We didn't this time and regretted it immediately. Four cups of coffee the first morning cost over 20 dollars, and that's with me bringing them up from the bar area. After that we went out and got it locally.*Walk everywhere and find really cool short cuts (this city is full of sweet parks and gardens) plus you discover all kinds of charming neighborhoods, local color and people performing fantastic music on the streets.*Buy your food, water (its 8 dollars for the bottle in the room), and other necessities in the many little convenience stores locally. *Mariano's Grocery store (wonderful!) located in the cute park behind the hotel, Has everything you need food-wise and more. Great coffee, deli, prepared food and a sweet out door area to sit and enjoy your gourmet gatherings. I met many of the locals there and had some fun interactions. Prices are very good, about 1/4 of what you pay in the hotel 'store' and its a fun way to get a feeling for the neighborhood. Remember, you have a fridge in the room, but no freezer, so you'll have to eat all that ice cream as soon as you get back. Aw shucks.*Find some of the local treasures/ galleries/ restaurants/ music. I enjoyed the thoroughly savory fare and brilliant vibrant hues of the Black Coffee Gallery, right next to Marianos. Ask to see their 'book' which shows the many artists who have contributed. Its edgy and fresh, and the staff are super nice.*Feel free to ask for help from the staff. I found them really helpful and customer oriented. I think the hotel has done a good job in hiring young people from around the country and world who really enjoy what they do. They were all friendly, intelligent, and highly motivated.*Only use the phone for inside hotel calls. Make sure to use your cell for all else or the pay phone at Union station. Otherwise you pay $13 per call. *Do Not use the ATM on the lower level from the lobby. I tried to, and not only did they tack on 3.50 surcharges on their end, in addition to my banks fees for same transaction bringing that to over 5.50 just to get my money, but I never got it! The screen and receipt told me there was a 'communication failure' and to try later. My bank told me after I'd gotten home that my account had been debited for the amount requested (but never received). Avoid that machine and use one of the many other bank ATM's in the area instead.All in all a solid hotel and you can mold it into what you need. Enjoy!

"I paid $279++ through American Express Travel for my stay in July 2014. At that time, there were multiple conferences going on so rate was high. I've been monitoring their rate, and it goes down to low $100's during off-peak season. At that rate, it's totally worth it, but anything above $200 is not. The room was clean but a bit outdated in terms of furniture, bathroom, and decor. The view is excellent. Lakeshore East neighborhood is awesome. But if you are first time visitor to Chicago, want to tour around, this hotel's location is a bit out of your way.  I didn't try the Palm Restaurant this trip, but tried many times before. Lunch is well-priced and tasty, but dinner is a bit overpriced though their grilled lobster was delicious!"
"This is a 4 star hotel that is well located in downtown Chicago. It bears all the hallmarks of its grade - including the price!It is the first US hotel. - or even motel(!) I have stayed in without any tea and coffee facilities in the room! I queried this with guest services and was advised I could either order a coffee from room service for US10, or buy a coffee downstairs from 06.30. No good for an early riser!This is 5 star profiteering at a 4 star hotel. At checkout I was advised to ""it changed in March; complain to management"".Otherwise, a good hotel.

So I went here on a trip I won through one of my distributors. After reading reviews here I found out they charge extra for Internet and rooms do not have coffee makers. Who does that anymore? Turns out my room had free wifi from the distributor. I asked the hotel to bring me a Krups machine for $15 but they forgot to on two separate occasions so they comp'd it. Rooms are nice and location is great
"We had a wonderful experience for our first time staying there. Pros - we arrived early (10am!) and they were so accommodating. We asked for the kids suite & they decorated it so nice with kids table & chairs, tons of stuffed animals, books & a game and Legos. The bedding was changed to kids bedding. Bathroom had rubber duckies all over the bathtub. There were child towels, soap dish, glasses & tissue holder & rug. So cute! Corner suite on the upper level (we had 35th floor) is the way to go. PERFECT view of river & lake/navy pier. We could watch Navy Pier's fireworks from our suite. The suite is soooo roomy & nice sized bathrooms/showers. Taxi service is so easy to get there. Staff very nice, friendly & accommodating! Breakfast buffet that comes with your room was very good. FYI - you don't need to tip the server at breakfast (we did with cash) & then realized after that gratuity is charged to your room. Not a big deal - our waiter was very nice but just something to know for our next visit. Elevator is NOT complicated. It's actually quite easy. Just updated in technology that others tend to fear.Cons - a bit longer of a walk to places BUT you can't beat the hotel spectacular views. Wifi costs extra - BUT - they will comp wifi service for you if you ask. Yes, valet parking overpriced BUT - for me, the positives we experienced over rides the cons. We hope to be back next summer & hoping they will allow us to request our same room!

"I stayed at this hotel a few years ago on a trip with friends. The hotel overlooks the Navy Pier and is centrally located so it was easy to either catch a quick cab or walk to wherever you needed to go. The room was comfy and clean and the bathroom was huge compared to other hotel bathrooms (with 4 girls trying to get ready all at once this was very important). The best part about this hotel, though, was the view. From my bed I could see the Pier lit up at night and it was awesome. I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone traveling to Chicago.

"Right when my co-worker and I got to the hotel, we walked into a customer talking with a janitor right next to my room enterence. we found out the reason why, there was a pile of feces behind the door. They did not offer to comp us anything, they simply ""cleaned it up"" which did not even get rid of the smell. We asked to be moved. They do not tell you to get wifi in your room costs an additional $15/day, pool cot $10/day. Just was not the best service, and the restaurant was not the greatest.The beds were comfortable, the elevators were kind of strange."
"Room was clean and comfortable. The room was also a decent size, where many seem to be really small. If you're a big person, you may not like the shower, it's a corner unit and not very large. I'm 5'11'' and 155 lbs., plenty of room for me. Location is actually pretty good. Easy walk to Millennium Park and all downtown restaurants. Even though there is a building in the way, I would ask for a Lake view, you can see the lake if you have a high enough floor. Don't eat at the hotel, venture into the city and find a good restaurant, there are plenty. I was there for a conference and the conference space was very nice and easy to access. Had to pay for WiFi, which I think should be included in the room.

"If you take advantage of their ""Going Green"" service, be aware they will not enter your room at all, to remove any laundry, dirty linens, remove trash, replace shampoos, conditioners, soaps. I thought it would just include maybe not vacuuming and leaving sheets and towels. For four days my room was not touched even though I called down to the front desk twice. :(Other than this, it is a wonderful hotel. Beautiful hotel, fabulous location, for the most part friendly and attentive staff."
"Stayed for 3 nights attending a weekend meeting held at the hotel. The room was nice & spacious - only downside was no hot water pot to make coffee/ tea as what several other reviewers had mentioned. Fortunately wifi was provided In the room as part of the package for the meeting, otherwise would have had to pay for it! The lift system is unique- just press the number of the floor you intend to go to- no buttons inside the lift- only at the lift lobby areas- makes me wonder about security as one usually uses the room card to gain access to the room floors. On the whole, it's a nice hotel with a convenient location to the Magnificent Mile & the Chicago Riverwalk amongst other places of interest."
"My wife and I recently spent a Saturday evening at the Swissotel Chicago following a concert. We have stayed there before, so I was familiar with its great location...and easy short walk (even shorter cab ride) to most places of interest.It had been several years since our last visit. We were extremely please with the upgrades and decor of the rooms as well as the common areas. Most importantly, the room, especially the bathroom was very clean!The staff was also very attentive and professional. At one point, I was in the lobby a few feet from the front desk looking around and one of the staff asked me if I needed change. Well that was exactly what I needed...still can't figure out how she knew that???We were very please with our experience and will definitely return."
"Pretty good location with great views, but overpriced hotel where everything is ala carte - it doesn't even have a coffee pot in the room! Unheard of! And Starbucks in the lobby is $4/cup. The room is confusing - the staff even said many people don't understand the stupid little nuances of the rooms. The manual doesn't mention many important things, like:You have to press a button on the refrigerator interior every two hours for it to stay cold!The lights and electrical switches are confusing - couldn't charge my laptop without helpManual doesn't tell you that Internet is free in the lobbyInternet is not free in the roomManual doesn't tell you that room service carries a service fee (food way overpriced)$65/night to park? Come on! That's even high for ChicagoBar staff acts like you are asking for the world when you want more of their munchies (must buy a drink and even then they are very stingy with the peanuts)Rude bar manager - overhead him berating guests and telling bartender to refuse drinks to themNo breakfast - NO FREE COFFEE in lobby except for 4-6 am! How cheap is cheap?Ditto no fruit in lobby - no cookies - not even mints - No Nothing but waterFitness center is nice - it should be for an extra $15/dayYou can save $5/day (big deal) if you don't have maid service but you have to use $ thereMy room had no card to hang to indicate no maid service, but others did - ordered by phoneConfusing as to how to get paper products if you opt for no maid serviceTHEY SCREWED UP MULTIPLE WAKE UP CALLS 4 TIMES IN 5 DAYSDesk is too high for chair or chair is too low for desk to write ergonomicallyPros: Nice down toppers on beds, they will hold bags for you for awhile, late checkout ok, offer to waive fees like gym or Internet (even they realize the fees are ridiculous)I wouldn't stay there again because of the above....if they were more reasonably-priced, had coffee pots in the room and spent a little time deciphering their confusing room nuances for guest, I would consider it.

"I stayed at this hotel while attending a conference. I had shipped a package to my name in advance, and the front desk staff alerted me to this at check in. Check in was easy. Nice large rooms, great fitness area, good location, poor internet connection. The day prior to checkout I asked for a late check out time of 1:00 PM, but was only given until 12:30. this was a hassle because I had a meeting. Other than that, the stay was good."
"We stayed there July 4th wknd. Although the hotel staff was excellent, the bartender and hotel manager need lessons in customer service. They also only had 1 bartender on one of the busiest days of the year. Waited over 30 min and waiter never came back to table. Finally found spot at bar and waited 20 more. Manager was rude and disrespectful and they even lost our signed meal and drink receipt amongst all the bad service and waiting. Will never go back again. PS the rooms do not have coffee makers cause they want you you to buy it!"
"The Hotel was very clean, as the room. It is centrally located. However for the paid price I eould have expected free Internet connection, instead no way, internet at an n average price of 15 bugs for a day. Speed not fast.Internet nowadays is a must. How can you plan the day if you don't have access to Internet. Sure they say that in the lobby is for free. If you comeback from a long day or if you are hanger for conquering the city, you need Internet."
"I stayed here for three nights on a business trip in late June 2014. I enjoyed my stay and could find very little to complain about, although I only used the hotel as a place to sleep since I was out a work commitments from sunrise to past sunset.This hotel is located near the Chicago River, Riverwalk and all the attractions there. However, it is on an elevated roadway and there is not an easy or pleasant walk to get down to the Riverwalk from the hotel. It is also located near Millennium Park and there is a fairly easy and scenic way to walk there from the hotel.Tips:* The blackout curtains are between the window and the privacy curtains. Don't be fooled by the decorative curtains in front of the privacy curtains that don't go all the way across the window.* The bathroom light switch looks like a two-position switch, but it is actually a three position switch. Up is on. Middle is off. Down is dim (night light).High Points:* Everything in the room was quiet and there was little street noise despite being next door to the fire station.* Shower temperature and water pressure were good. Hot water from the sink faucet was too hot, but pressure was good. There was a bathtub in addition to the glass stall shower.Low Points:* The desk chair had tattered front corners, one with an exposed frame, padding and sharp fastener.* I wanted more lighting. There was only a ceiling light inside the door, a floor lamp next to the easy chair and an extremely dim LED desk lamp. No overhead light or reading light over the bed.* There is no coffee machine in the room. (Not a problem for me, but maybe for you.)


Room Tip: Rooms facing East and North have the best views.

"The location of the hotel is superb, easy walking distance to State Street, the Miracle Mile, and Navy Pier. The hotel was nice.On the other hand we were not given the type of bed arrangement we had reserved several months before. Also there was a ridiculous charge for internet in the room, and there was no internet in the lobby. There was a computer for printing boarding passes.We did not have a car with us, but be prepared. Parking is $65/day in the lot closest to the hotel.Our beds were EXTREMELY overly soft and uncomfortable."
"This was our first stay in a Swissotel and it was very pleasant. We used Travelocity to get a good deal on a room and it happened to be at Swissotel. The lobby wasn't very large, but it was nicely decorated, and the staff was pleasant. The room was nice (as I would expect), and the view was impressive (25th floor). We only had breakfast in the hotel on the last day, and although the food was good it was overpriced. If I recall, the buffet was around $25 a person and the individual entrees (just eggs, toast, bacon, and some fruit) were about $12. If you didn't want to eat a ton it was better to get the individual entrees, but still felt just like standard food for the price.Also something that was interesting: the workout room and pool are on the top floor and have great views. The mens and womens locker rooms have showers that have one whole wall as a window; the mens showers have frosted glass but the womens' do not! I'm not sure if this is common in high-rise buildings."
"Stayed here for four nights while attending a conference at the hotel. Nice property in a fairly convenient location. Room was quite nice, though for some reason I had a hard time sleeping and I'm normally a sleep anywhere kinda guy. I don't understand why some hotels still charge extra for internet....feels like buckle and dimung and its a hassle to reconnect every 24 hours. Connecting multiples devices was a bigger hassle. Another issue was the service at the lobby bar during breakfast...more like, breakSLOW. had me running late a could times. Splurge on the extra employee and keep people happy."
"My husband and I stayed there for 4 days over the 4th of July. We had a good experience, customer service was professional and courteous! The only drawback for us is that wifi was not included in the hotel stay. For this being 2014, including Wifi should be standard. The Palm restaurant located in the hotel was top notch!! If you visit ask for Janet as your waitress she was excellent! I recommend the chicken Parmesan....which is one of their best sellers. We didn't upgrade our room but still had a nice view of the river from our room!"
Stayed at the hotel during an weekend business trip to Chicago. This was my second stay at this hotel and the lobby area that was under construction during my last visit was completed. The rooms are well designed and comfortable. Amenities are top rate. Love the computerized elevators that keep waits to a minimum. Service was friendly and helpful all around. In addition the hotel has a great location along the river. Highly recommend at this price point.
"A wonderful 7 night stay .great location for sightseeing etc all within walking distance.Room was excellent ,had a lake view room with afantastic view ,especially of the amazing thunderstorms playing over Lake Michigan .Room well designed ,comfortable and spacious ,heavenly pillows!Bathroom spacious and well set out for blowdrying hair(usually a nightmare in most hotels).Staff were extremely helpful and nothing was...

"situated in amongst the shops bars and restaurants, easy access to main areas of interest. Staff were very accommodating nothing was ever too much trouble. Hotel was undergoing refurb but this did not effect our stay. Make sure you ask for a coffee maker In your room or else you have to pop downstairs in the lobby to get a cuppa. Wine hour is a must ,lovely way to start your evening.Get the red line train from the airport and get off at Clarke and Lake costs 3 dollars each and is quicker than a taxi."
"Though the hotel was under renovations while I was there the disruptions were minimal. Very small rooms but I was there on business so not really an issue. Very very nice staff. Could not be more helpful. Good restaurant. Only downside is that you must walk outside of the hotel and around the corner to access. Not so nice in rainy and cold April that Chicago is. I would recommend it overall as a well located business hotel..


Room Tip: Ask to be away from the elevators. It got very noisy one night when I was trying to get to sleep

"The walls are thin, expect to hear your neighbours, their arguments or the ""good mornings"" when they meet up.The bathrooms are closet sized and the bed is probably the worse Kimpton bed I've slept in but maybe it was just that it was a pillow top.The hotel was undergoing renovation but really didn't disrupt the stay. The adjoining restaurant was poor and I hope the food is next on the renovation list.Fitness centre had relatively big, varied (free weights, gym balls, machines) but no windows and opposite guest rooms.Amenities were CO Bigelow for Kimpton: relatively bland but well proportioned.Wi-fi dropped out now and again. The elevators were paradoxical in that they seemed so quick when you were inside them but you are left waiting for quite a while, particularly in the lobby area."
"First of all, our stay was amazing. Hands down our favorite Hotel in Chicago....as a Kimpton Karma Rewards member we get special rates, opportunities for upgrades and a $10 raid the mini bar coupon. Everyone gets a free 5-6 pm wine and beer reception every evening. When the concierge asked where we were going to dinner he called ahead as we were walking through the lobby and had the restaurant give us a complementary appetizer.The room we stayed in was smaller than before but it was still very comfortable....love the easy wifi, minibar, robes, yoga mat and 24 hr yoga channel. It had been redecorated. I think in the larger rooms the scale of the design in the carpet and wallpaper probably work better. Kind of a nod to Art Deco....The new bathrooms are really nice however. We did have one small maintenance problem with the toilet but they were there in five minutes....called us because we had left the ""do not disturb"" outside the door before knocking (I love that) and then were in and out in five minutes....crisis averted! Every single person on staff, whether it is the front desk, wine reception, bellman (who remembered us from a previous visit), concierge, doorman, maintenance, or valet is so friendly, polite, and accommodating...they treat us like we are millionaires (trust me we aren't). We love staying in the theater district whether we are seeing a production or not. Virtually on-site is Chicago 312, and excellent restaurant and small bar, and so many great restaurants within walking distance! If you don't want to walk, cabs are plentiful. We also love that this hotel is dog-friendly. Needless to say we have already booked our next stay."
"The hotel is under renovation but they do not do work until after 9:00 a.m. in the morning. I am not sure when they stop because I came at 7:00 p.m. and it was quite. Small rooms but very pleasant. Hotel staff are just the best. I had a 'ton' of luggage after a many week travel experience in many cities. I stayed with my daughter, who also have too much luggage. They had no problem with all our junk. The manager on duty could see my problem immediately and came to give me help. She was very professional and brought over a specific employee to give me a hand. Even though there is construction, it does not seem to be a problem. No problem with in internet and I am a high user of it at the hotel.


Room Tip: My understanding the fourth floor was the first floor to be renovated.

The allegro was undergoing maintenance but that in no way hampered my stay. The thing that I did appreciate the most about this hotel is that they actually have a light switch that turns on the light for the whole room.I'm really sick of hotels that just have a little tiny light above the bed and nothing on the ceiling.They rearranged my toiletries more than most hotels and even placed a couple of my things on a shelf across the bathroom that almost caused me to leave them behind.I sprayed myself in the face a few times with the shower because even after all of these years the faucet with the stick handle that you turn a little bit for the top and a lot of bit for the hand shower always result in getting sprayed out of the hand held shower sprayer.A good visit. Awesome location. Will stay again.
"Very Pleasant staff upon arrival. Found parking around the corner for $42 a night. The hotel itself is undergoing renovations, and I'm not quite sure if I had a renovated room or original room. The room itself was average to small in size. The bathrooom, while nicely appointed, was very small. The location is excellent if you plan to go to a theater show or view the Willis Tower. The 312 restaurant served a quick and delicious Eggs Benedict on Sunday morning."
"Staff is welcoming and amazing - really responsive and focused. Great job management. Hotel is under construction - limited in hotel choices for breakfast/dinner etc while construction is going on. Stayed in older rooms (not renovated). It is okay - small, desk faces wall - so cannot easily work and watch TV.Coffee in the morning was lukewarm - and wine in the evening was a nice touch. Overall the lobby is somewhat dim and the construction makes the whole thing less then it could be.Walgrens is right across the corner - and of course there are restaurants to go nearby."
"This hotel is basically within walking distance to everything you need to see, millenium park and the shops of michigan ave. They are doing a remodel its beautiful so far and no, there was no noise. Our view was of concrete buidlings, but that cant be helped in a large city like chicago. The staff was very friendly, the room was small but very clean and if you forget shampoo they use co bigelow products, which are amazing."
"The bride booked a block of rooms here for her out of town guests. What a great hotel! Super easy ( and cheap! ) to get to from O' Hare using the blue line to Lake and Clark street station. It was 5 dollars and about 50 minutes. Easy peasy. The hotel is under renovation construction, but we only knew that from reading prior reviews and the first day we arrived ( friday) we could smell fresh paint in the hallway. Otherwise, we were not affected at all by construction. Some of the people from the wedding party who also stayed here complained about the room size, but we felt like the room was fine. It was clean, the bed comfortable, and fit our luggage with no issue. We were only there to sleep! Free happy hour! Hello! Beer and wine, every night for an hour. Great fun and a good way to meet other guests. We enjoyed that every night of our stay! The coffee is not the best, but complimentary. So there is that. Skip it and walk 4 blocks to Intelligentsia coffee shop. The staff was pleasant, professional and accommodating. Jean- luc, in addition to pouring a generous glass of wine and beer gave us an awesome dinner recommendation ( Sunda rocked, thank you! ). Kudos Jean-luc, kudos.the hotel was conveniently located near major theatres, good restaurants and millennium park. Good quality hotel for the money. I will stay here again when we return!"
Very disappointed! We knew hotel was under construction but from other reviews it seemed to be fine. Not for us! Our room was old and just felt so dirty!!! I didn't want to take my socks off and slept with light on. Yuck! Hairs in shower hairs on bed spread! Also we got to hotel around10pm no where to eat or have a drink! Very expensive and very disappointed!we will never stay there again! We stayed at Omni Chicago hotel the night before and loved it!!!
"Spend a Saturday night here to see a show & have dinner during the hotel's construction phase. The staff is very friendly and helpful. The room decor and amenities were nice for an older hotel. Excellent location in walking distance to theatre district and transportation. Also had a lovely pre-theatre dinner at their Italian restaurant, 312 Chicago. We'll be back again to stay another time after their lobby renovation. Recommended."
"The hotel was under construction during my stay. There was no construction noise at night, and the only issue I had was minor - only one elevator was in service for a period of time during my stay. I think they did a very good job of limiting construction inconvenience . My room was small, but very well appointed and quiet. I could hear very little street noise and did not hear people in the adjoining rooms. This hotel is located within a block of the Washington and Wells train station and two blocks from North Wacker. It is convenient to west loop businesses. I recommend this hotel for business travelers, but my room would have been very small for a family.


Room Tip: Ask for a room on an upper floor for less street noise.

"Spent one night at Hotel Allegro in March 2015 for a random weekend in the city with my husband. Classic hotels in Chicago have great atmosphere, and when the Allegro finishes their construction, it should make a nice alternative to similar-style places. Until then, the hotel is more utilitarian. We did have a lovely stay, however. We were fortunate enough to be able to check in at 10 a.m. and were given a newly renovated room on the 19th floor. Fresh robes were in the closet, and fluffy socks were available for purchase. There was also a well-stocked mini bar/fridge. I will note that the bathroom was extremely small, even moreso than is usual with a historic Chicago hotel. It was also lacking a full-length mirror, an oversight I hope they remedy. The staff was extremely pleasant and helpful; one staff member actually walked us over to where the ATM was stationed, rather than just pointing the way. The cocktail hour is a nice touch, although I don't think it is enough to replace a full-service lobby bar. The hotel is clearly in a state of transition, so I will be interested in seeing what becomes of it in the future. One thing to consider when booking here: Location. The Allegro is very conveniently located to theaters and the financial district. However, the hotel is just far enough away from the Mag Mile, lakefront, and better restaurants to make walking a chore. The area tends to shut down by 10 pm, so late-night activity and dining is very hard to come by in that area."
"Charming old building retains much original detail with modern decor that works very well with it all. Great wallpaper, furniture, light fixtures & accessories in the lobby & first floor lounge areas. Wonderful places to read their excellent art books, have a drink, check your devices. Room was modest sized & totally adequate for 1 person. Staff members were friendly & tried their best to be helpful. I didn't give it 5 stars because it took hours to get my room ready (even though I told them what time I would be arriving) & the restaurant was okay but not outstanding. Walking distance to everything I wanted to do, including the conference I was attending. Will be staying here again this year at a very good rate & recommend it.


Room Tip: Avoid facing the elevated train as it can be noisy. Ask for a room away from the elevators.

"This is by far my favorite hotel in Chicago! Hotel Allegro is a Kimpton Hotel. Recently Fortune Magazine rated Kimpton Hotels one of the 100 best Companies to work for. In fact, Kimpton came in 11th in the survey! I have found all the Kimpton hotels excellent. The staff at Hotel Allegro is particularly attentive. The Hotel Allegro is well situated. We stayed because we were going to the Lyric Opera which is a short 5-minute walk. It is in the heart of the theater district. It is an absolutely great place to stay if attending a performance. The hotel is undergoing a renovation, but there was no problem with noise! My wife and I particularly like the complimentary wine hour! We will definitely be back!!!!


Room Tip: Definitely attend the complimentary wine hour!!

"Bed was fantastic, rooms are very small. Hotel is under construction so the check in is in a temporary spot. My room keys didn't work when I got to my room and the front desk person was not very sympathetic as I was carrying my bag, briefcase and boots up and down to have it fixed. Valet parking for $59 continues to be an issue so beware that if you get a good rate online, taxes are about 20% and valet parking is pricey. Good location. I will probably stay elsewhere next time as there are tons of choices as reasonable prices in this area.


Room Tip: Ask for a room that has already been renovated.

I stayed during a business trip and couldn't be happier with the hotel and service. The front desk agents were friendly and helpful. Every request/question was met with a smile and quick action. The room was small but very nicely decorated and comfortable. It was exactly what I expected. The wine hour in the lobby was a nice touch. It was a little strange that the lobby is on the second floor. The best thing about the hotel is the location. It's right in the theater district and short walking distance to restaurants and shopping.
"You discover it is under refurbishment only when you book the room, nothing wrong with it but I'd have rather preferred to know it in advance.My room was super tiny but nice with a strage steel like burnt wood that I have already found in some kiloton hotel. My suggestion? If this is your kiloton fragrance..look for something fresher and betterPeople at the front desk is ok except for one lady which was not helpful when my door key had a problem and she make me go up and down three times..very annoying. It is easy to be nice when everything works smoothly but it is when we need help that we see the difference in service.."
"First of all the scented air in the hotel is gloriously refreshing and uplifting! Second, check in and check out is painless and the folks are friendly and cheerful. The decor is beautiful and comfortable. The whole atmosphere is inviting. The beds are divine, the rooms are attractive but not overdone. The full length mirror that's altered with a chandelier and an antique look could go (just not a fan and actually want to utilize the mirror) each bathroom would benefit from a magnifying mirror but it's no deal breaker. The location is perfect and there are two options for dining and relaxing without leaving the building. My sister directed me to Kimpton hotels and now I'm a true follower!


Green Features: They're just about as green as a hotel can be!"
"We have stayed at the Allegro several times -always with our dogs. The pet friendly atmosphere is great - treats, baggies, plenty of other dogs. Plus, the hotel is beautiful, convenient and affordable. Attached to the Cadillac theater and within a 5 minute walk of Marshal Field's (I know it's Macy's).

"I stayed just one night for business and selected the hotel primarily due to its proximity to my business meeting. If you are interested in the theater, this is the place to stay. Generally, the service accommodations were excellent. The room was a bit small, but for my purpose was quite suitable. There is a complimentary happy hour from 5 to 6 and a very nice breakfast. However, I would not recommend the bar/restaurant on the ground level. One of the few meals in many years that I could not get through. Had to send most back uneaten."
"Check-in and check-out were a breeze. I've read lots of complaints about small rooms, but ours was quite big -- certainly big enough to do yoga on the thoughtfully provided mat. Since this is a renovated older hotel, there are some oddities -- the dark hallways, combined with the silvery wallpaper, gave it kind of a prison vibe, and the bathroom, though nicely appointed, was very small. The room was very quiet -- we didn't hear anyone else except for housekeeping doing their morning rounds. The front desk staff was very friendly. We wanted to talk to the concierge to make reservations, etc. for us, but never managed to find one--but I guess that's what smartphones are for. I stayed on a corporate rate, and I'd stay again: the location is terrific--in the middle between to the bars and restaurants of the West Loop, and the museums/Michigan Avenue."
"Was given a wonderful end suite at this property, loved the bigelow toiletries, the evening social hour 5-6pm with free wine, beers - was super! And the classic, modern, contemporary design throughout the hotel was superb. I loved the fancy cycling machine in the gym - amazing 3D like actually riding. You can tell the attention to detail this hotel has - it's great and it's my first time at Kimpton and i'll be coming back. Also as a Kimpton member, I was given a $10 mini bar credit and free internet - I love this chain of hotels... I hope they stay this amazing!"
"Here for a conference; room was booked by my State workplace. It turns out that without a special form completed in advance, rooms are only RESERVED not PAID FOR... resulting in a $810 charge to my personal account which I will now have to fight for reimbursement. Not a nice suprise--I can only assume that the website is not very clear on the reserve/purchase issue, otherwise our financial person who does stuff this daily would have filled out the appropriate forms. And we're still waiting for the form 30 minutes later. This situation is why I'm rating it ""poor.""Other than that, the woman delivering the news of the devastating $810 charge was delightful, and visibly pained at having to charge me that amount. The place is cute--it's imperfections kind of make it. If you have a disability, you absolutely must tell them when you book your room. It would be impossible for a wheelchair or otherwise differently-abled person to navigate the room.There's also free wine from 5 to 6 pm--and for $810, I am going to drink buckets of it."
"The hotel was beautiful. The facility is older and the rooms were a little small, however, the service and the staff more than made up for that minor issue. We were in town for a wedding and the kindness that was bestowed upon my family members was more than I could have ever expected. All of the staff was extremely friendly and helpful with every contact from the counter staff, valets, and cleaning staff. The hotel is clean, quiet, and very comfortable."
"4 minutes from Clark and Lake ""L"" stop. Wonderful lobby. Nice clean room with a large built in wardrobe complete with bathrobes. Plenty of charging points including usb points. Big style digital clock, large screen TV and mini bar. Plenty of side lights and ceiling lights. Shower over bath; minor gripe if you turn the sink tap on mind you don't soak yourself. Hairdryer in the bathroom and a nice big wall mirror with decent lighting. Staff were friendly and there is a wine hour between 5-6pm when you can get a complimentary glass of wine or beer. The lobby bar food was good but the bar shuts at 10:30pm which we found strange. Yes we would stay again."
"I had to stay at the Allegro for business recently. The hotel is conveniently located close to the Clark/Lake metro stop and within the loop. Upon arrival my check in process was quick and painless. I signed up for the Kimpton Karma rewards program solely to get the free wi-fi the hotel has to offer. I seriously doubt I will be using it ever again. It was not that the hotel was bad, it was just that it was not quite my cup of tea. So I checked in during their happy hour they have everyday around five. Apparently they have free wine and beer but I just grabbed an hors d'oeuvre as a snack and made my way to my room. I did not really go to any of the happy hours so I could not tell you much. The room was somewhat small but not too small. There was a double bed and desk, chair, dresser, and TV. The first thing that hit me about the room was the decor. It was a good thing I did not partake in the happy hours, because if I did the wall paper would have made me vomit. It was so dizzying that I could not even look at it without feeling nauseous. I understand this is supposed to be a ""boutique"" hotel, but the decor really was quite obnoxious. The chair looked as it had been pulled right out of a movie about 1990s that was made in the 1950s. The carpet was also a bizarre dizzying zig-zag design as well. So not wanting to look at the decor too much, I watched TV. Which made it frustrating when their satellite dish service went out three times when I was there. I was only there for 5 days total and the TV went out on three of them. Not a very good ratio there. The closet was tiny, and 1/3 was taken up by their tacky bathrobe that looked raggy and old. Needless to say, but I did not even take it off the hangar. There was barely room for my three dress shirts in the closet, that's how small it was. I found myself hanging them in the bathroom. Which brings me to the bathroom. It was quite small but functioned as a bathroom. It was just several little things that made it inconvenient. The towel rack is in the shower, yup, IN the shower. So you have to move your towels every time you take a shower. The toilet paper is on a roll on the wall behind the toilet but in between the sink and the toilet. So you have to reach almost backward to get the TP. I found myself just taking the roll off the holder and leaving it on the counter. They provide soaps and shampoos just as any other hotel does. There is also a mini-bar but I did not use anything out of it. I needed toothpaste and they had some in the mini bar but I figured I would get some free toothpaste downstairs rather than pay $8 for organic toothpaste.  I called down later one night to pick up a burger at Encore, the on site restaurant, and it was pretty good, but nothing to write home about. Check out was easy and painless. All in all it was several little things that just annoyed me about this hotel. The bed was comfortable and it served its purpose, there was nothing that really blew me away that would lead me to call this hotel even ""very good"". I even waffled between poor and average before I told myself that it served its purpose and I had no bad interactions, my bed was made everyday, so it is pretty much just an average hotel."
"Our 2 night stay at Hotel Allegro was wonderful. The service was excellent and staff was very friendly. Although the rooms are small, we didn't mind since we were there to enjoy the city, and not spend a lot of time in the room. The walls are thin, but we had good ""neighbors"" so it wasn't an issue for us. The location is great as well. We were able to walk everywhere we wanted to go, but Taxi fare is very reasonable if that is what you chose. We will most certainly stay there again!!"
"This is a lovely hotel in a great location in downtown Chicago. We stayed here for two nights for a family wedding (at the hotel as well) and had a wonderful experience. The El station is just a couple of minute walk, so we were able to get easy airport access without paying cab fares.

"For some bizarre reason, hoteliers love to label their hotels as boutique to cover up flaws. This is NOT a four-star hotel as we were promised when booking. It's a 3...and that's a stretch. Everything is old...interior and exterior...but not in a charming way; in a dirty, ready for renovation-type way. We checked in, contacted the booking agent and rapidly checked out. (It was not because the room was small as others have noted. It's NYC size..not teenie) If the complimentary wine/beer is incentive enough to stay here then it will probably work for you. Located in the theater district and middle of the Loop so there are many things within walking distance."
"The most notable thing about this hotel was the extremely poor elevator service. The elevators were too few in number, and too slow, to service the number of hotel guests. On more than one occasion, we had to wait 10-15 minutes before we could get on an elevator - they were all jam-packed. The hotel was otherwise adequate, although the rooms were small, and the free happy hour from 5:00-6:00 daily is a nice touch. However, the elevators made this hotel unacceptable.


Room Tip: Stay on a low floor so you can use the stairs.

"My husband and I like the Kimpton chain, this was our first stay in Chicago. The room was small but had what we needed and bed was comfy. It would be nice if all hotels would provide a complimentary bottle of water, what would it cost ? Less than a dollar ! We returned to our room at 8pm and could clearly hear the couple next door to us ' enjoying themselves ' Oh dear, it was funny but if it had been late at night it would have woken us up !"
"Not what I would expect from a Kimpton Hotel!! However, the hotel has a beautiful entrance and lobby. The rooms are small, but have a contemporary decor and were sufficient for my needs. The 312 Chicago Restaurant was a bit pricey but the service and food were good. The Encore Liquid Lounge was great for unwinding at the end of a busy day and the bartender, I think his name was Raul, was great and very attentive."
"Large rooms, however the beds are not king size!!! Nice deco, clean design. The hotel us very we'll located in the theatre district , 5 minutes walk to a couple of blue line metro stations.The lobby is not at street level but on second floor, huge design space , and everyday around 5pm one gets a free couple if wine glasses !! Service is great, people sympathetic .Breakfast included in the room fare and taken at the ""31"" Italian restaurant(?1st class place by the way) waiters are dedicated and sympathetic !Interior design us inspired by Art Deco architecture of Chicago with a twist if contemporary arty touch !!!A real great stay!"
Just got back from a 4 night stay at Hotel Allegro and just loved it! Rooms were smallish but nothing worse than boutique hotels in New York or New Orleans. Rooms are very well designed so even in small spaces all amenities were still available. Beds were super comfy!The complimentary wine hour was very well utilized and very much appreciated! For the rate and location (theatre district) - you can't go wrong with this little place. It even has a Starbucks on the ground floor. The only reason I'm giving it a 4 out of 5 (would give 4.5 if possible) is that the only thing missing is some type of continental breakfast.
"I stay here regularly, meaning more than once a month. So have stayed in multiple rooms and clearly it is not bad since I keep coming back. That said, it is not perfect or even great and there are some things you should know. The most important thing for anyone (I think) to know before you book: there is NO room service. That's right. NO room service. There are restaurants but they range from weekday-worker-fare to night-out-fare. So either fast food or expensive restaurant, not a lot in between. If you are there on a Sunday, a lot of the restaurants are closed including the hotels, Encore. The WiFi has a catch or a cost: to get free WiFi you have to sign up for their loyalty program. If you don't care, then you are golden. If you don't want them to have your e-mail, etc., then you have to pay and it is NOT cheap. The rooms vary significantly in quality, size and layout. Generally ask to be facing the street and on the East side of the building. This way you have some kind of view and are not disturbed by the El. It is a dog friendly hotel that does have a dog care package for check-in. Sadly you only get it if 1) the desk person is a dog person or 2) you ask for it. Most of the desk people will not offer it or even know where they are kept. Go to the Encore! The staff at the large bar is AMAZING! They will make you feel welcome, taken care of and appreciated. The small bar - not so much. This mostly seems to be staffed by pretty girls with scan brains and few social skills. The happy hour deals are excellent (often up to 50% off) and the food and drinks are good. Tequila Tuesday is my favorite - $2 tacos and $6 Margarita. 312 - where to start? The coffee is undrinkable and their excuse is that it is ""strong"". Strong does not make coffee bitter and that stuff is more BITTER than a divorced Desperate Housewife with a prenup. The food is good but expensive and the services doesn't make you feel like you are paying as much as you are. They seem to be understaffed for all meals. Go somewhere else. You know how some hotels the service is so good the stay is ""better than home""? This is not that place. The service varies radically and they need new management to provide consistent standards: the staff are either amazing (bend over backwards to make you happy) or incompetent-lazy. The porters for the most part will ignore you. They do not open the door (except for one gentleman), they do not get you a cab, mostly they stand around chatting, there does not seem to be much of a reason for them to be present. The desk staff is all over the place in quality and service. One thing the desk staff is really good at is never knowing who I am even though I've been there 7 times this quarter and always reciting the same ""welcome"" speech. Location, location, location. Really it is excellent. Quick walk to work. The kids were here and walked to most of the major destinations. Blocks to Millennium Park and all that has to offer. Blocks to the West Loop and the Sears Tower. Easy public transportation and to access to cabs. It is really convenient."
"I stayed here for the Chicago Marathon and it was very convenient for both the race and for entertainment and shopping. Being in the loop, I was very close to multiple L stops so I was able to get around town quite easily. Still, most of the places I visited were walking distance including museums and restaurants. Neighborhood was great and I had no issues walking around at night alone. The hotel itself is fun and interesting and I was given mini bar or hotel bar credits - good times!"
"I am not a picky person by any means. And I've stayed in a wide range of hotels: everything from Days Inn to Waldorf. I booked Hotel Allegro as an Express Deal through Priceline (a practice I am coming to regret more and more). I will give the property this, the location was good for arriving from Midway and taking the Orange line into town. The hotel was approximately 1/2 block from the L station and about a 10 minute walk from Union Station. There was plenty of shopping and Grant/Millennium Park were a quick walk away (although be warned N State St and Michigan Ave shopping are kind of a hike). Now let me cover the major bases of my stay. As always, the room is first. Yes it is a boutique hotel so the rooms are smaller than in your typical chains and since this was an older building that was remodeled they are an odd often awkward shape. The king deluxe had a hallway with a closet immediately to the left inside the door, to the right the bathroom and then the hallway opened up into the bulk of the living space. The bathroom was clean but incredibly small. Since one single door wouldn't fit the bathroom is closed off by double wooden French doors. While standing in the tub you can easily reach the sink across the room. The toilet is in between and it is nearly impossible to maneuver around the room without some part of your body then touching the toilet. Getting changed in the bathroom itself would be nearly impossible. The shower head was typical hotel fare but had good pressure, however the faucet for the tub stuck out to far denying anyone who wanted to take a bath about 6 inches of tub space. The rest of the room is standard issue except one thing. The bed was the hardest, most uncomfortable bed I have ever slept on and I found myself tossing and turning and waking up still. It would be a good room if you were needing proximity to the theater district or you found a killer price online.  Many times in hotels with lackluster rooms I find myself thinking how great the staff was and how that really made a not-so-great room better. In the case of Allegro, Kimpton needs to step in immediately and do some customer service training. When we arrived at the hotel check-in was fairly quick. i advised the front desk that the next day I would be having a birthday cake delivered at 1pm and would be at the front desk between 5-6pm to pick it up. I was told this would be no problem and a note would be put on the account. When I went to get the cake the next afternoon, the young woman at the desk said she had no idea what I was talking about, that no cake had been delivered, and that was I sure I even ordered a cake. The cake had been meant as a surprise which failed miserably after my companion asked why I was waiting at the desk so long. Again, I was questioned if I'd actually ordered a cake, and then blame was shifted to the bakery who ""might not have delivered it."" After 10 more minutes of searching she finally came back with the cake. We went up to the room and since the cake looked beyond amazing (I will review them too!) we decided to have a slice. I called down and asked if 2 forks and 2 plates could be sent up. The voice on the other end hemmed and hawed a bit and then told me ""ummm yeah."" Only 40 short minutes later they arrived, although the young man who brought them up seemed apologetic and sincere. We headed out for dinner and as we came out of the front doors there was a doorman talking with another employee. We stood for a minute waiting to be acknowledged or asked if needed a cab. We were noticed but the two stayed engaged in their conversation. Annoyed we walked half a block down to a cab parked on the side of the street in front of the theater. The next day we checked 4 bags so we could explore the city before departing. When we arrived at the hotel at 6pm we went to collect our luggage (for some reason they don't have a bell desk so this entire process is contingent on someone actually asking if you need something). We were approached by the girl from the cake debacle who took our tickets and disappeared. After a few minutes she came back with one bag and then asked me to describe the others. After about 5 more minutes she came back with my luggage but we were short my companions last piece. She asked if there was another bag and if we were sure we checked it. We described it and she disappeared for another while before coming back with it. I almost felt like I was on candid camera. There is no other way to describe the staff other than either very badly trained or literally people they pulled off the street and hired. I can't imagine ever seeing this type of service at any other chain. Some other fun facts about the hotel? The walls are thin as paper: we not only got to hear our neighbor and her beau fight and cry until late in the evening but also got to here them make up the next day. At wine reception I was given the duty of telling anyone else that got in line that wine reception was over. The views from the rooms, at least on the 10th floor were of the street and a parking lot in which I got to watch people relieve themselves after Lollapalooza.The ac is jahnke and unless you want it 65 it will be 80. However, I will say the lobby was beautiful and the dimming lights next to the bed were also nice. There's lots of options in Chicago for you to lay your head in exchange for your hard earned money. I'm not sure I'd spend it at Allegro again.


Room Tip: If you must stay here ask for a high floor away from the old elevators.

"I booked this through the blind booking system on priceline, so I got the room at a much cheaper rate than was available on any other sites I'd found. I do not think I would have been happy if I had paid the rates on other websites.I got a ""King room"", and although it did have a king size bed, it was still a queen sized room at best. The room was clean with modern enough decor. The bathroom was absolutely tiny.The location is good - only a few minutes walk from many of the popular sites, and pretty quiet at night, though my room did not overlook the street. It's nearby the ""L"" blue line, which makes for a very cheap option to and from O'Hare. The staff were polite, if not overly friendly. WiFi is not included with the room."
"You couldn't ask for a better location. Walking distance to all major attractions. A subway line leading directly to the airport (no transfer) is a mere 2-3 minute walk away. Cost: $3 per person; as compared to about $50 by taxi.A number of reviewers were not happy about the front desk. Yes, the personnel there were professional without exuding warmth. Nor were they willing to accommodate beyond the book. Except for CHRIS. He is a gem who went backward to please. The major downside is the size of the room. They are tiny, especially the bathroom. The basin is almost on top of the toilet, thereby rendering little standing room. I would return, but will definitely ask for a bigger room.


Room Tip: Choose this hotel for its terrific location. But book a bigger room.

"We were looking for a hotel with easy access to attractions and the trains and this hotel was just right. The wine social in the lobby each evening was a lot of fun. Two nights, there were people from the Field museum with insects, both alive and in cases. Everyone on the staff was helpful, even the porter telling us what local beers he thinks are the best! It was our first stay in a Kimpton Hotel and I don't think it will be our last."
"Boutique hotel rooms are smaller- I get it. But shouldn't they have a closet, especially if you book a king size bed in room for 5 nights ? Granted, I got a deal through one of the Priceline -Travelocity type cites weeks in advance, but still.The good- ---very clean, pretty lobby area, location in theatre district, large tv, high end toiletries and faucets in bath.I asked for a room with a closet, offering to pay more, and they gave me one no charge. Room wasn't bigger, but had a small closet and I got a robe to use! Why didn't they give me that one in the first place if they had it all along The bad- room had space for my bed, the mini-bar, and a tiny, but nice, cramped, bathroom.Card keys had to be re-keyed. Didn't work...When changing rooms, no offer was made to assist me with my bags.The bellman Lost my personal pillow from home. Went through talking to 4 different people about it, had to fill out a form, and 3 weeks later, I still haven't received reimbursement as promised.Really felt as though I was given the run around for a pillow, for Pete's sake! It was a Sharper Image pillow, so I was asking $75 to replace it and pillowcase.some of the other Kimpton properties may be worth checking out, but I'd steer clear of the Allegra, unless you really love free, cheap wine at their happy hour, and coffee in am (Coffee is good!)"
"My wife and I stayed in this hotel for 4 nights in mid-June. We had a King Deluxe room on the 14th floor. Although clean, the small room was nothing to rave about. The bed was comfortable enough, but the roman-shade blackout curtains didn't do a good enough job of blocking out the morning sun. In general the walls of the room were paper-thin, so much so that we could hear our neighbor coughing and sneezing in the next room over! You can also hear housekeeping knocking on each door while making their morning rounds. At over $200/night my biggest gripe about this place was the bathroom -- it's one of the smallest hotel bathrooms I've ever seen! You can sit on the toilet with both arms outstretched -- one hand will touch the shower wall, and the other hand will touch the mirror above the sink. The counter space around the sink is minimal which makes it difficult to get ready for evening events. While this hotel is conviently located in the theater district, this area pretty much lacks nightlife so you'll have to head to the North-side of the river for hip bars and restaurants.The Washington/Wells Metro station is close by, as well as the Clarke/Lake station (the blue line will get you to and from O'Hare Airport). Chicago is an awesome city with much better hotels to stay at!"
Fantastic experience! The Allegro is conveniently located in theater district and close to Metra stations. The staff is friendly and it has a wonderful boutique feel and look. Rooms are typically small for city hotels but exceptionally clean. The nightly free wine and appetizers in the lobby are an excellent way to unwind and start your evening. We stayed for an anniversary getaway to enjoy a play and dinner at the 312 restaurant located on site. The staff made us feel very welcome and made a special effort to help us celebrate our anniversary by giving us a top floor room and Champagne and dessert voucher for the 312 restaurant. This hotel is a perfect spot for a reasonably priced but wonderful place to stay downtown Chicago.
"Stayed two nights with my wife at start of a road trip. Registration was quick and easy. Room was away from road and on fifth floor which meant it was lovely and quiet. Rooms very clean. Only real complaint was continental breakfast. We were given cards to hand to servers which entitled us to small bowl of fruit and two slices of toast plus Orange juice and coffee. Anything extra was charged which to me seemed to be a rip off. Overall though a good hotel in a great location offering value for money other than breakfast.

"There were a lot of good aspects to this hotel: The beds are very comfortable, the staff was friendly, it's in a good location, and it has the good Kimpton touches of the evening wine hour, morning coffee, and nice robes. The rooms were small, but okay. WiFi should be free for everyone, but it's free if one joins the loyalty program. There were two main problems. First, the bathrooms are extremely small. There is very little room to put anything, the tub/shower is very small and the water temperature was hard to adjust, and the towels were small and mostly pretty worn. The other problem is that the rooms aren't very good at keeping out sound. The hotel is dog-friendly, which is great, except for when the dog in the next room starts yapping in the morning."
"The location of the hotel was fab. If you are not going all out with the limo or taxi service with the transportation to and from the hotel - this is the hotel to go to.I took the direct train from Midway international airport to Wells/Washington stop - took about 35 mins, with a 5 mins walk to the hotel. From the hotel, you could walk everywhere - federal bank of Chicago, theaters, Cloud gate. They have free bicycles which you could borrow too [free].Service was mediocre but consistent of the Kimpton chain. Nothing to WOW about, but nothing to complain either - conducted in a business-like manner. Early check-in was quick and fast. Usual happy hours from 5 to 6pm. Gym was functional.No issues with noise as others have talked about - had a room on the 16th floor.If you are looking for consistent service in a well-located area - this is the hotel to be in. If you are looking to spend a lot of time in the hotel with the red carpet service, skip this hotel. I would chose this hotel again as Chicago was too beautiful to be spending that much time in hotels.


Green Features: They did not provide toothpaste and toothbrush. However, you could request for it. I like that coz no point wasting such resources."
"I stayed here for a week for work. It's a lovely art deco boutique hotel on Randolph street right near the shops, theatres and CBD. In fact, there is a theatre next door called Cadillac Palace. The room is a bit small but it was perfect for me as it made me feel very cosy and at home. The room is modern, very clean and the bed very comfortable. And in the evenings, I think between 5-6pm the hotel provides a free wine appreciation social drinks for the guests. I really enjoyed my stay here and would come back again."
"My wife got us tickets to see Phantom of the Opera at the (almost) next door Cadillac Palace Theater, and because of the great January rates, she decided we should stay downtown and make a weekend out of the trip into the city. ""Retro chic"" is the best way to describe the decor, and although the building is very old, it was very modern and comfortable. We got a King Single room, which was massive by Chicago hotel standards. Nice touches like plush bathrobes, glass cocktail and wine glasses, great shower, and super comfortable bed were very welcome. The HD TV was great, too, but it got little use. We had dinner at the connected 312 restaurant (very good!), and ordered a late carry-out flatbread from Encore - all easily charged to our room. Valet parking was pricey, but typical of 24 hours of parking in the Loop, and very efficient. Great weekend!


Room Tip: We had no view from our window, but we didn't care. If you want one, you might try asking.

"I took my daughter and a friend to see Phantom of the Opera in Chicago. I had booked (or so I thought) a double queen room through Travelzoo, but when I arrived I was told I had no reservation and they were fully booked. When I showed the desk agent my paperwork, she pointed out that I had failed to agree to the terms and conditions, so my request did not process. However, they found me a single queen room for the same rate and offered us a rollaway bed. The rollaway wouldn't fit in the room, but the housekeeper who brought the bed suggested we lay the mattress on the floor. This worked out fine. The room was tiny but we had a good time, enjoyed pizza and salad in the adjoining restaurant, and were able to walk next door for the show and leave our coats and bags at the hotel. What could have been a disaster turned out to be a fun ""girlie"" weekend thanks to the accommodating and flexible staff at Hotel Allegro. Thank you for saving our weekend!


Room Tip: The bathrooms and closet are terribly small but functional. Just fine for a night or two.

"I loved the hotel's modern decor and the contemporary feel. The bed was comfortable, the room spacious. However the bathroom is pretty small, I think you can shower and brush your teeth at the same time. We did not get out much due to a meeting but it is right next to the L which is good and bad. The good, is it would be easy to get around, the bad, you are right next to the L. The common areas are pretty. Some of the couches are prettier than are comfortable though. The evening wine/beer reception is a huge plus. Goose Island ales and passed pizza. Very nice touch!


Room Tip: Get a room away from the elevators. Mine was across and I could hear the elevator from my room.

"Although I was in Chicago for business and did not see a show, I wanted to with all the fantastic theaters all around. The Art Institute and lots of other sites and shops are within walking distance. This is the third Kimpton Hotel I've stayed in and they are wonderful: warm and welcoming service with lovely rooms. My Queen room was more compact that the double rooms I've stayed in, but I had all the amenities that I needed. My room was well furnished, the bed was very comfortable, and the bathroom compact but clean and well appointed. The 5-6pm beverage hour is terrific and a nice way to unwind after work. We ate at 312 one evening, the adjoining restaurant, and enjoyed the food and service there. Would definitely return to this hotel."
"My boyfriend and I stayed at the Hotel Allegro in November 2013 and we absolutely adored it! The room is beautiful and the location is extremely convenient! The hotel is newly renovated and is simply stunning. The staff was very courteous, friendly and helpful - they helped us pick a nearby restaurant on our first night! Since the hotel is located in the Theatre District, there are plenty of things to visit and see. We're both in our early 20's and it took us about 15-20 minutes to walk to the Magnificent Mile, 20 minutes to the Navy Pier, roughly 30 minutes to Millenium Park/Art Institute, and 45 minutes to Soldier Field. Taking a taxi is very cheap (we realized this on our last day) - it's around 5$ for a ride to Soldier Field from the hotel! The only downside is there is no parking within the hotel you have to park at a parking garage. I believe it is like this for many hotels in downtown Chicago though. We parked our car for 3 nights in the ""Lasalle Parking"", if I remember correctly, and the service was fantastic! I definitely recommend this hotel to everyone! It is in a great location, quiet, beautiful, and the beds were very comfortable. My one and only tip would be to visit the lobby desk regarding internet access! We thought we had to pay but if you sign up as one of their members you receive FREE wifi in your room!

"The rooms were very clean and well kempt, but not particularly interesting and smaller than many other Kimpton hotels that I've enjoyed.The staff was pleasant, but in other Kimpton experiences I've been blown away by how friendly and helpful the staff could be... not so this time. No complaint, just not impressed.One quibble: the elevator is unreasonably slow from the lobby. If you drop down a floor to the entrance, you can catch it easily, but at lobby I was waiting for over ten minutes each time I caught the elevator. That's a long time. The location is within the Loop and makes it easy to catch various L trains to get to wherever you might need to go. It's also a short walk from Milennium park, and from plenty of good restaurants. The lobby area is pleasant, bright, and comfortable.All in all, I'd go back but I would likely check out the Monaco first. It is a nice place, just not quite as nice as other Kimpton Hotels that I've enjoyed.Perks: free wine hour from 5-6, decent wine and beer. free coffee (very good coffee) in the morning in the lobby is much tastier than the typical in-room coffee pot (you can request a coffee pot, if you prefer). Join the inTouch program, it is free and gives you free wifi as well as a $10 coupon towards the minibar in your room, which is typically well-stocked.


Green Features: they claim to be focused on green practices, I didn't research it beyond their claims."
"I stayed here for a conference (the conference was held at the hotel as well). It was a nice hotel overall, but it was not the best Kimpton I've stayed in (the best were all in Washington, DC). It was a renovated older hotel and that seemed pretty apparent. The rooms were smaller than other Kimptons i've stayed in and I had terrible allergies the whole time (as did a few other conference attendees), so I think they may not have done a thorough flush or renovation of the air ducts. The temperature was also hard to get right (it was either freezing or boiling) and the window was painted shut, so I had no possibility for fresh air.The breakout rooms for the conference were odd -- ours was too big and another one was double booked. The main ballroom is right next to the train tracks, so you do hear a lot of noise over speakers when a train goes by. Also, the walls in the bedrooms are really thin. I heard a very long conversation my neighbor was having on the phone until late at night.Those are the negatives. There were also plenty of positives. The lobby was great - lots of comfortable seating for networking with high ceilings and a nice atmosphere (decorated to Kimpton standards). The customer service was top notch. On checking out, I mentioned that I missed my baby, and they gave me a bag of Kimpton Kids goodies, which was a nice touch. I love the InTouch members benefits of a $10 credit from the mini-bar (I had a massive bottle of water, which clocked in on the price sheet at over $6, so that was a nice benefit--although that's a benefit for members at all Kimpton hotels). The free yoga mat (also a Kimpton-wide perk) was nice, but the room was very small and so it was hard to find space to do yoga! The toiletries were very nice quality. The location is really fantastic. It's a 1.5 blocks from the El (I took the El from Midway and they're both on the orange line, so this was a big bonus). Plus easy to walk to lots of locations around downtown Chicago from the hotel. They also stored something for me in the freezer, which was nice.I give it very high marks for service and location. I only knock of a rating for the air quality and smallness of the rooms compared to other Kimptons I've stayed in.

"Visited downtown Chicago with my adult daughter for the weekend. Booked the Hotel Allegro and we were pleased. When we arrived, they had a free wine hour which we were not expecting. What a treat - it started the weekend out the right way. The front desk staff was very friendly and helpful. We were extremely happy with the convenient location to the Amtrak Station and to what we had wanted to do. In the morning they served coffee and tea with a few fun fixings. They were very accommodating to store our luggage after check out time so we could go around town without hauling our luggage around. The bathroom was small but was not a problem for a short stay. Would stay there again when visiting Chicago."
"The Allegro is my new home-away-from-home. I'm in Chicago frequently for business, and work just a few blocks from the hotel. Only drawback: Their standard room is somewhat small. But anyone familiar with the Kimpton Hotels brand knows they do their best to make up for it, particularly among frequent customers. Decor throughout the hotel is cool and quirky, and the beds are super comfortable. Rooms are also functional with a big desk with lots of plugs available. Loyalty club members get $10 credit towards mini bar purchases (or a cocktail in the hotel bar) on every stay plus free wifi. There's a wine hour every day where the hotel serves free wine and beer to guests, and a coffee bar every morning.Plus there are yoga mats in every room, free bike rentals and tons of loungey, comfortable places to sit.Finally, there's a restaurant on the first floor, as well as a Starbucks. Makes it easy to grab and go.Overall, a comfortable place to go

"THE GOOD:One thing is certain, the service in this hotel is excellent! The check in process was super quick, the woman at the desk offered several suggestions to improve my stay, and they responded so quickly to my request for a coffee maker in the room that they almost beat me to the hotel room door. (In addition to the coffee maker, they brought several K-cup options, and every item one might possibly need to enjoy coffee or tea.) The entire hotel was spotless, including the room. It was easy to see that the cleaning staff take exceptional pride in their work. There is a complimentary wine gathering at 5:00 pm each day, with healthy servings of wine offered by friendly servers. There were no requests unanswered, and all were greeted with smiles and genuine offers to help!The hotel is smack in the middle of downtown. The location offers live entertainment, coffee shops, great dining at just about any price point, and multiple shopping spots to be had within a short walk.THE BAD:The rooms are miniscule! The bathroom is super small (think closet), with a narrow, tiny counter that ensures that getting ready is an absolute pain. The rooms have NO sound proofing between them, making for embarrassing evenings listening to people in the next room talking and/or doing other things that really should not be shared with neighbors. There is also NO sound proofing between the walls of adjacent room bathrooms, which needs no further explanation. Ick! All hallway noise comes into the room as well, so one can give up on getting any sleep until the entire hotel floor chooses to go to bed for the night.If only one could transplant the amazing staff into a larger, soundproofed hotel in that exact same spot!

"I had a great time at the Allegro during a work trip in downtown Chicago. I was only there for exactly 24 hours, but during that time I had an awesome experience.Kimpton Hotels does a great job keep a clean house and always having a fabulous, fun and quirky decor. Every square inch of this place is spotless! My room, while rather small, was clean, smartly decorated and so comfortable. This was one of the best sleeps I've had on a work trip, hands down.All of the staff from front desk, to room service are so happy and willing to help. That goes a long way.My only gripes are the $60 valet charge to wait 30 minutes for the car and the size of the bathroom. The valet service made me late for a flight, I could have used that time! My rooms bath was so small, you could use the shower, toilet and sink at once.Overall, I will totally return."
"Great location in the middle of downtown, within reach to City Hall, State Daley Plaza, Dyvvy Bikes, the Washington Wells CTA Orange Line Station (one of the three stations in the Loop with elevators), and many theaters. There is a Starbucks on the first floor, and a CVS pharmacy within a block. Our family was greeted with a bag full of goodies for our children (the lighted yo-yos were a great hit!), and check in was pretty fast. Just be aware: The lobby is in the second floor, so if you don't feel like taking their beautiful staircase up to the lobby, you'll need to wait for a while for an available elevator. We were assigned room 725, which is handicap accessible. We had not requested that type of room, but we were fine with it, because the room and bathroom were very spacious. Beds were very comfy, but wished our pillows were a bit firmer. The flooring in the bathroom needs to be revisited, because a large pool of water kept being form in the middle of the bathroom after each shower. Internet connection in the room was fast. Check out was fast, except for the wait for an elevator; it was early Sunday morning, and we had been waiting in line for over 15 minutes, when finally one of the cleaning staff was kind to show us the service elevator."
"Stayed here for the weekend, and wasn't blown away. Landed a room on Hotwire for $200 a night, and I was a bit disappointed when I saw the room - it was rather small and underwhelming. Elevators took forever - the shortest wait to go downstairs was just under 5 minutes.That being said, everything was clean, all of the amenities one would expect were there, and they had a nice local beer and wine event with complementary beverages the first night we were there. Location is prime - right by the loop and the main shopping district.Staff was lovely - in short, they tried, but still couldn't reconcile the fact that I didn't get much of a room for the price we paid."
"We were here attending a conference and were given a corner room. The bed was comfy and the room large. Complementary umbrella, slipper, yoga mat and robes in the room. Also had a small iron and board. The check in is one floor up from street level and each evening has a hosted wine and beer reception with one passed appy based on the day. Starbucks off the street levbel door and a great little bar on the other side which made getting a night cap super easy. The gym on the 5th ? floor is functional and they have complimentary headphones in case your forget. Nice touch.It is an older building and we were on the 10th floor and could see and hear the train when it passed. Great location, easy to public transit which made getting around the city a breeze. The only reason it does not get a 5 is that it did not exceed my expectation, but it certainly met them."
"Dear Kimpton brass: About the Allegro...it needs updating. It's not a bad hotel at all -- we had a decent five-day stay there -- but it's shabby around the edges. We were wowed by your Monaco in Denver, enjoyed your Surfcomber in Miami Beach, but let down by the ordinariness of the Allegro in Chicago. Will the Epic in Miami be what we expect from Kimpton? We're pondering it. Anyhow, back to the Allegro: Good staff, convenient Loop location, no noise on the 14th floor (no view either, but that's tolerable in a downtown hotel). We didn't leave complaining or in a bad mood -- even with the minuscule closet or when the bathroom door knob fell off -- but we didn't depart inspired to come back. Send us a note when you get the Allegro spiffed up. Oh, by the way, a kudo: Your next-door 312 Restaurant was the highlight of our stay. See our separate review on that.


Room Tip: Stay away from the noisy, elevated Loop tracks! We were on the 14th floor, overlooking nothing, but...

"I stayed two nights for meetins in the area. This hotel is located within walking distance to Union Station, Michigan avenue shopping, financial district on Wacker Drive, Millenium Park, and theatre district.. I stayed in 1228, room was on the smaller side - good for max two adults. The complementary wine bar and morning coffee bar are very well done. Starbucks is located in the same building. Very convenient option if you do not want to always hail a cab. I enjoyed it."
"Great hotel! The location, the service, the accomodations . . . . all excellent. My entire family stayed at the hotel for two nights on the occasion of my 2nd daughter's, second marriage. The wedding, wedding dinner/dance and goodbye breakfast were all hosted by the hotel. Every one of the hotel staff we came in contact with was friendly and completely service oriented. It was almost impossible to believe that a commercial enterprise like this hotel could be staffed by such nice, friendly folks. And the meals . . . . . outstanding! The wedding dinner was as good as any fine restaurant might serve . . . . . delicious, and served with style and grace. The wedding was conducted in the beautiful hotel ballroom and was conducted perfectly to the enjoyment of all, especially the bride and groom! The entire event made for wonderful picture taking opportunities and lasting memories. Very nicely done. Everyone's room was also comfortable, nicely decorated and pleasing to stay in.Coupled with the outstanding location in the middle of the theater district, a wonderful overall experience.


Room Tip: The room with only a king size bed was somewhat small and cramped. Suggest a multiple bed room. Al...

"What I liked the most about the Kimpton Allegro was the location. It was in the middle of the Theater district but it did not feel crowded or touristy. All main locations were within walking distance and there was a metro 5 minutes away from the hotel. The rooms are nicely decorated and we loved the Bigelow toilletries. The staff was very friendly and the concierge, Anthony gave us a great recommendation for dinner, EPIC. I also liked the fact the rooms have free wi-fi with the inTouch membership. Overall a great experience.


Green Features: Liked how there was a recycling bin in the room. Nice touch."
"It looks like it's been recently refurbished and they've done a lovely job. Nice decor, nice room, nice bed, good [free] wifi, all the stuff you need as a business traveller. The best part are the people who are, without exception, really friendly and nice to chat to.the little touches are great - like the yoga mat in the room and yoga channel on the TV, the ribbon around the bath mat and the free bike loan from the front desk. The free wine is a bonus too!"
"I never really understood the value proposition of Kimpton Hotels. I am guessing ""cheap"" would nail it, as these properties are indeed reasonnably priced for well located urban properties. The one in Cambridge Mass was acceptable, and i stayed there many times despite its shortcomings. The Allegro in Chicago is a notch down. The location in the Loop is good. Service is friendly. But the decor and attention to detail are not to my taste. Bordering on the 'design for the uneducated' category, it is a mix of old style American middle class luxury cues (textured wall papier, gold ribbons and heavy cushions...) all mixed in with cheap imitations of contemporary furniture. As a result, we have none of the confort or cosines of a Stark or Garcia, and none of the sobriety of an Eames or Puttman. Attention to detail is weird too. My huge suite has a real bathtub (nice for a change in a us hotel), but no shelf space and no toothbrush glasses. Breakfast was your usual industrial stuff, but no salt or pepper. Minibar is locked but the key doesn't work. Am I supposed to call housekeeping every time to get this fixed? Rooms are somewhat noisy, I am listening to my neighbour's telephone conversation as we speak. All in all a decent place for the cost conscious, but definitely not the experience it overtrades as."
"My girlfriend and I stayed here for four nights in August 2013. I read loads of reviews on Tripadvisor before opting for the Allegro and I'm really glad I did. The free wine reception every evening was an added bonus (and one of the things that swung it for me - I thought a hotel that gave you free booze couldn't be all bad), but it was perfect in so many ways. Our room was lovely and really quiet (I emailed ahead of our arrival and asked for something not too many floors up and they were only too happy to oblige), the breakfast every morning in 312 was a great way to set us up for the day, and the location was great - walking distance to Millennium Park and the Magnificent Mile.It was a bit quiet at night, but I think that's just Chicago. It seems the nightlife might be reserved for the suburbs. A great hotel, I'd recommend it highly."
"We took advantage of the ""All Inclusive"" special we found on the hotel website. It included free valet parking and a dining credit for both days we stayed. While this is obviously an older Hotel that has been furnished to look new and modern, it was still quite nice. While hotel restaurants can be hit and miss, we thought 312 was a HIT. Excellent breakfast and dinner we had. The rooms are fine. Bathroom was very tight, but who cares? I'm not staying at the hotel to hang out in the bathroom. Again, old Hotel. Didnt eat from the mini-bar, but I did use the fridge for my personal beers. The location is a few blocks further away from the main action of Michigan Ave, but I think it's reflected in the slightly lower prices. Hotel staff was not snotty like another fancy Chicago hotel we stayed at. Plus you can't beat the free Happy hour at 5pm. Couple beers in the hotel lobby before dinner. Perfect!"
"I have long favored Kimpton hotels, and on this visit their superiority in their class was once again confirmed for me. When I arrived early -- VERY early, like 9 a.m. -- I was told that there was actually a room available for me. But when I went to the room, I discovered it had not, in fact, been made up. I returned to the lobby and the staff apologized, but there was no other room to offer me. I was not overly put out -- I was six hours early for check-in, after all. Later that evening, when I returned from dinner, there was a lovely plate of cheese and accompaniments and a full bottle of red wine waiting with a handwritten note apologizing for the inconvenience at check in! Whatever very slight exasperation I might have felt from my experience that morning was more than erased, and my loyalty to the chain was strengthened.(Additionally, my room was clean and lovely, and the Kimpton In Touch perks were appreciated as always.)Highly recommend!"
"We have used Kimpton Hotels before and knew the Allegro would be 'quirky'What we did not realise was that when we arrived, we were informed that for the duration of our stay, Paramount Pictures would be filming scenes for 'Transformers 4' outside.As a great fan of the flickering screen, it was the icing on the cake.The hotel, as usual, was friendly and well organised.The music was great (see my review of the Palomar Hotel in San Francisco)Kimpton appear to select old hotels in city centres of a medium size, and make them into 'boutique'Hotels with a homely feel. (They even have a free wine 'get together' in the lobby from 5-6)The room was very good and in addition to the usual mini bar they had a selection of 'missed items' i.e. toothpaste,shoe polish,tooth brush and even a condom for those unplanned meetings!!(I love America!!)The restaurant was good but a little pricey but then it is the city centre.Check out the old,and unfortunately not used internal mail system, next to all the lifts that used to 'deposit' your mail into the box on the ground floor!We enjoyed our stay at the Allegro and will return.


Room Tip: Get a room on the first floo to watch the film set!!!

"This is a typical Kimpton with attention to detail and first class customer service. Rooms are small but comfortable. Decor is stylish and welcoming. The room was clean and adequate. The hotel restaurant is very good, with again excellent service. The hotel is well located for the theatre district and main attractions.We have stayed in Kimptons before and prefer concierge to be dressed in formal uniform so they are easily recognisable as staff. The communal areas are exceptional, comfy chairs with quirky decor. We enjoyed the wine reception but the person fronting should have done some research about the wine they are serving, without having to resort to reading information from the bottle label !"
"The Allegro is a lovely hotel in such a central location. The staff are very friendly and couldn't be more helpful if they tried. Modern hotel, which I liked. Housekeeping was done daily - even the day we had the 'do not disturb' sign out, housekeeping rang our room to see if we needed anything, such as towels or shampoo! Great service! Excellent hotel, and would most definitely stay here again if I was in Chicago again! Thanks to all for a fantastic stay :-)"
"I got this hotel through Priceline and for the price I paid, it was ok. But at advertised rates, I don't think it's worth it and it should not be 4*I had a standard queen room that was on the small side, but not as small as some of the reviews made it out to be. It was spacious enough for 2 people to move around without any issues. The bed was very good but the closet was very small and there was no in room coffee. Overall, I think the hotel is a tad old and the rooms smaller and not as well appointed as a 4* should be."
"I had a thoroughly enjoyable stay at the Hotel Allegro and I will definitely return next time I visit Chicago. The location is excellent as it is easily accessed from the airport via the subway's 'blue line' and most of the cities attractions such as the Willis Tower, Magnificent Mile, Chicago River and many others are within easy walking distance. You can also find every colour of subway line with 3 to 4 blocks so even further away attractions are easily accessed. The hotel itself, was clean, well maintained and the staff were very friendly. The rooms were comfortable (the bed especially) and provided you with a range of accessories including an iron, safe, etc."
"We stayed here for our son's wedding which was held at the hotel over Labor Day weekend. Everything was wonderful. The hotel is beautiful. The staff was helpful and courteous. The bed was so comfortable, we slept great. We were in an upgraded suite which was very roomy. The bathroom was a nice size for the suite. (I guess the regular rooms have a small bathroom I heard.) Thank you's go out to all the staff for making our stay and son's wedding a fabulous experience. We want to especially acknowledge KT Thompson the wedding coordinator, for going above and beyond to please all. We are truly grateful for your expertise and caring manner to make this wedding special and beautiful as it was!!"
"I was recently on a business trip to Chicago and was pleasantly surprised with everything the Allegro had to offer. When I entered the ground level I immediately saw a bunch of fun bikes off to the right, next to the Starbucks entrance. In the elevator I saw a poster that indicated I could borrow the bike to explore the city or get to my meeting. I inquired about it at checkin and was happy to find it was free! I checked in at 3pm, threw my stuff down in my room and was exploring the city on a beach cruiser-style bike by 3:15. I rode along the waterfront, the city bike trails, etc. and enjoyed the beautiful weather in a fun way.My overall stay at the Allegro was great. They hold an evening happy hour of free wine from 5-6pm. The lobby is spacious and comfortable and found that many guests enjoyed socializing with other guests during the wine hour. It made me feel more at home given this open, inviting environment.The location was great - within walking distance to everything I needed and cabs were readily available when necessary. The staff was professional, friendly and helpful and I loved having a Starbucks in the base of the building. I would definitely stay here again."
"Very much a boutique hotel with smaller space, but perfectly suited for our needs. The staff was incredibly helpful, friendly and professional. The location was wonderful with much of what we wanted to do within walking or a short cab ride's distance. I simply adore that they accept pets and that you're not limited to just one. This is a very rare amenity. The fitness room was also a nice surprise - very clean and well maintained with plenty of equipment, weights, etc. This area also has a water cooler, which was much appreciated."
"We've stayed in Kimpton hotels before and they are becoming my favorite places to stay. My husband and I, along with our 9 month old son stayed here over the 4th of July weekend and it was better than I could have expected. The staff was very helpful and courteous and made us feel welcome, especially with a complimentary upgrade to a suite. Having a separate room for our baby to sleep in was great and meant we weren't going to spend our evening hunkered in the bathroom. The staff at 312 was also very kind and attentive to us, and the location can't be beat for a Chicago get away. I've recommended this hotel already and have another stay booked coming up. This is what a boutique hotel should be like!"
"I love Kimpton hotels, I mean who can pass up a daily happy hour and free wifi? However, despite the great location of this hotel, the decor could use a bit of updating and the rooms were slightly outdated. The service was fantastic, with the staff working hard to meet my every need. Room service was very tasty and moderately affordable for a downtown hotel. Overall, this was a great business stay and I would recommend for another quick visit."
"Stayed there for business. It is more of a pleasure travel hotel. Small room (1 or 2 only) and the bathroom was tiny but enough to get done what I needed. There were no hanging closets, no irons, no coffee makers in the rooms and the work space is not great. I have stayed before fun for pleasure travel. They allow dogs and it has cool decor and is more 'hipster' than a corporate franchise so not great for a work stay. If you are looking for a more relaxed stay, this is the place"
"I stayed at the Allegro in Chicago 1 night on my way from Philadelphia to Spokane. The lobby entrance and public areas of the hotel are beautifull and inviting, and I enjoyed the complimentary coffee and water. The location of the Hotel could not be better I walked around the Loop and to Union station. My room was very modern and comfortable,and the price I paid for my stay on the Hotel web was a great deal for such a nice Hotel and location. I enjoyed my stay so much my only regret was I didnt book an extra night at the Allegro. For dinner I ate at The 312 Italian restaurant at the hotel, and I must say the food exceded my expectations , it was the very best! Hope to return to the Allegro Hotel again one day .


Room Tip: No pool at hotel but they do have fitness room

"We arrived an hour prior to check in and the man at the check in desk was very nice, we told him we wanted to get information on a boat tour and he said the concierge would help us but there was nobody at the concierge desk at the time so after checking in we waited a bit and then decided to go to the room, unpack, and then talk to the concierge. We reserved a room with a king size bed but our room had a queen size bed, we decided to just stay in the room because we were only staying one night. After unpacking we went back down to the lobby to talk to the concierge, there still wasn't anyone at the desk so we sat and waited, and waited, and waited. The concierge never came. Maybe they should put a sign on the desk if the concierge is going to be gone for longer than 30 minutes. After spending a few hours in the city we got back to the hotel at about 5:15, just in time for the wine hour. The free wine and few passed apps were very nice, the only problem was the garbage laying around. We sat in chairs next to a small table, the table had a few wrappers, used napkins, coffee cup and water bottle on it and we looked around for a garbage can to throw the items in but couldn't find one. Later in the evening when we got back to our room we were going to order something from room service but they didn't have a room service menu. The book that has info on the hotel was missing a few pages and it referenced the feed me book for the room service menu but there wasn't one in the room. They also didn't have a list of what the items in the mini bar cost, we wanted some water but didn't want to have one if they were going to charge us $20. We've stayed at another Kimpton hotel in Chicago and that was a much better experience. We won't be staying here again."
"My husband and I stayed here for eight nights when he was in Chicago on business. One of the best features of this hotel is the location. It's right in the Loop, about a twenty minute-walk to some of Chicago's most popular attractions such as Millennium Park, the Chicago Institute of Art, and the Mag Mile. If you enjoy walking but don't want to be too far away from the attractions, this location is ideal. It's also about a 5-minute walk to a couple of Metra stops to get you to Wrigley Field and other interesting places.If you like quirky, funky, unique design, you'll probably appreciate the decor in the lobby and rooms. It wasn't quite my taste, but it was definitely different. Another good thing about this hotel was the complimentary coffee and tea from 6-10 a.m. Although a continental breakfast would have been nicer, it was better than being completely on your own first thing in the morning. The gym was basic but had all of the equipment I needed for cardio workouts and strength training. The front desk staff were alright, polite but not overly helpful. My biggest complaint about this hotel was that the rooms were very small. For the price, I expected a bit more space. Admittedly, if I had a shorter stay, this probably wouldn't have bothered me as much. Also, the rooms were out-dated; the black and white circle wallpaper made me feel like I was back in the seventies."
"I stayed at the Allegro on business and selected it because of the close proximity to the work site. I was not disappointed. The hotel is close to the El, making it easy to take the train from the airport. I was greeting by very friendly staff who remained very helpful throughout our stay. The rooms were small (typical for a city hotel) but very nicely appointed. Lots of outlets and comfortable workspace. I do like the the Kimpton happy hour. They had a nice selection of wine and sangria plus some appetizers. It's a good way to meet other travelers. I would highly recommend the Allegro.


Green Features: The hotel has in-room recycling and a towel reuse program."
"These rooms are small. I mean tiny. The main part of my room was just 10 by 15 feet. The closet was less than two feet square and the bathroom didn't even have an enclosed vanity, some of the toiletries were stored on a shelf under the sink.Small.The staff was friendly and the evening complimentary adult beverages were a nice touch.Parking was $56 per night (high even by Chicago standards) and they charged a colleague of mine $1.75 to print a boarding pass for his return flight. So while the sticker price is pretty low, they make some of that up by nickeling and diming.If you're on a budget, this place will work, but I think you can do better."
"I stayed at this hotel for 2 nights for a work meeting. I thought it was just OK. Kimptons try too hard for my taste -- the decor is a little too trendy. The rooms in this hotel were tiny, the smallest I've seen outside of NYC. That was what I liked the least. The bathroom sink was so tiny, when I washed my hands, water was splashed on my legs. I shower and night and usually get my hair wet in the morning (in order to style it), and my head would not fit under the spigot of the sink. The shower, however, was nice and had good water pressure.The gym was also small but had what I needed. The best part of the hotel was its location. As others have said -- in the theater district and close to buses and trains. Of course, that means I could hear the trains going by at night. I didn't have great sleep quality.I wouldn't rush to stay here again but would if the price was right."
"Absolutely fantastic location (inside the Loop), close to shopping, Willis Tower, Millenium Park and the general downtown. Rooms are seen bigger, however, comfertable and spacious beds. We got breakfast included, and it was served in the restaurant located next to the hotel. Staff was nice and helpful (both receptionists and concierge). The hotel has a great atmosphere and a very unique style. Even though the building is old and the hotel definitely has been renovated, they've managed to preserve the special feeling and touch this hotel has got.In the morning complementary coffee and tea are served and for a couple of hours each afternoon sangria and wine is served for free during happy hour. (And the sangria is great, too!).I would recommend this hotel and when I return to Chicago, this hotel will hopefully be where I'll stay!"
"This was a great place to be. The location is wonderful...right by the L stop we needed, in the heart of the theatre district, and very close to the shops on State. Hotel staff was exceptionally friendly. Our room was quite spacious. Perhaps we were an exception since I've read a lot of ""small room"" reviews here. We had a room at the very end of the hall on the top floor, and maybe that contributed to it. I don't know, but we had a bunch of space. Noise was not an issue at all. Loved the robes that are provided. The bathroom is very small, which was the only real annoyance we had since we had to get ready for a dinner out, and could only go in one at a time to do so, and is the only reason why I am giving this four stars. The wine reception was great. They offered wine, beer, and sangria. We opted for the sangria, which was light, refreshing, and absolutely delicious. There was also a chef preparing small plates of pasta, which was very good as well. Our sleep was very restful, and check out was a breeze. Since we planned on spending the day downtown after check out, we asked if they could hold our bag, and they were very accommodating. Though I wish the bathroom was bigger, our stay was absolutely wonderful and I would not hesitate to stay here again."
"We just commpleted a 3-day stay and were very satisifed. For starters, we got an excellent rate (via Hotwire) for a hotel that was comfy and extremely well located (near every subway line, near the theaters). The beds and pillows were confortable and wi-fi was free if you joined the hotel's ""club,"" (which was free to do). They had lots of nice little things: $10 of complimentary things form the (overpriced) inroom stash of snacks; nice shower robes (and a yoga mat!), 5 p.m. free wine. A minor negative: There was no coffee pot in the room, but free coffee in the lobby. (I believe one can ask for a coffee pot, but we didn't.) Our room was a good size with a spacious bathroom. Mattress was very comfortable. We didn't encounter too much noise."
"Booked blindly via Hotwire and wasn't sure what to expect. Decor was very unique and fun. Everything was clean. The free wine/beer from 5-6 was also great! The customer service was also friendly. I requested a king sized bed away from the L-train at check-in and they were more than accommodating. I noticed a lot of complaints about the rooms being small. They were small, it's a boutique hotel in the middle of the city. It was totally doable, and if you plan on spending most of your time around the city it really doesn't matter. My only complaint was that the walls were pretty thin. If you are a light sleeper, or worried about others hearing your conversations this could be annoying. All in all, I would recommend this hotel to others.

"This hotel is situated within the Loop which makes it a perfect central location to explore from. The hotel is very clean and nicely decorated and all staff we came across were friendly and very helpful. The rooms are on the slender size but we had plenty of room for us and the suitcases. We were on a Bed and Breakfast deal, which was fine for us but the breakfast was limited. It consisted of Coffee, fruit juice, cup of fruit and then a choice of toast/English muffin/Croissant. I would definitely come back to this hotel once we return to Chicago."
"Stayed here for a quick one night business trip to Chicago...This was a great hotel and I would have no hesitation in staying here on a future trip. The beds were super comfortable, and the rooms clean and contemporary. Katie at front desk was really friendly and a pleasure to deal with after a long flight. Definitely join the kimpton loyalty club too as it gets you a whole bunch of little extra's. Look forward to going back soon!"
"Our hotel room was ready upon our arrival. We arrived about an hour early, and there were no problems checking in. Our room was on the 8th floor. It was a smaller room but very clean. The decor was nice. One night there was a party in the room next door. People were singing, loud music, and smoking weed. I called the front desk, and they sent security up. All of the noise stopped. Other than that minor issue, we had absolutely no problems with this hotel. It's in a great location (theater district)."
"We loved the decor and got several decorating ideas from our room! Even though the rooms are on the smaller side, we had a baby, stroller AND a pack n play (which they provided including sheet!!) and were totally comfortable. There are TWO closets to hang your clothes in. The service was perfect and location was super close to all public transportation. There is a freshii.com a block away for you healthy eaters. Become a Kimpton member and get free wifi and $10 out of the minibar!! Will definitely stay here again!!"
"I have stayed here before. The public spaces and rooms are beautifully designed. The rooms are small but very well planned. The decor and appointments are A+. The staff is very nice. Bedding is nice. Amenities include the usual and bath robes, socks in the closet. There are no coffee makers in the room. You need to go downstairs in the morning for you complimentary cup.Unfortunately on this 5 night trip I had noisy room neighbors on and off. Make sure to have ear plugs just in case. Upon learning of the noise, I was delivered ear plugs and chocolates by the hotel. This certainly is a nice service jest urge.Also, the mattress in my room should have been replaced (or turned around/over) a long time ago. I didn't think to report this until I checked out. So, perhaps if you experience the same, report it. You will sleep better. The mattress was well dented on one side, by the telephone, as if a heavy person had been sleeping in that exact spot for a long time. (What I've learned is this must be the side where most people sleep.)"
"Stayed here with some friends for a weekend stay in one of the suites with king bed and separate living room. The room was great - spacious, well designed. Staff was friendly. Location is good right in the Loop though it is only 1 block from the L (elevated subway) which isn't particularly scenic and can get a little loud but it's certainly convenient getting to/from the airport. Overall a good hotel - would recommend!"
"Thoroughly enjoyed the spacious suite with my daughter. Plenty of room in bathroom to get ready for the evening event, It was fun to relax, read and watch the traffic below on the streets. Very nice ammenities. I enjoyed the happy hour on Friday evening and breakfast on Sat. a.m. Staff members are so nice. Looking forward to returning soonl

"Great location - just across the river on State/ a block and 1/2 from the Red/Orange/Brown line and 2 blocks from the Blue. The rooms are large, clean, on the modern side and come with free wifi. The staff are friendly and helpful. Your stay comes with a complimentary continental breakfast - located on every floor! And when I say continental I mean a full spread of coffee, juices, donuts, muffins, bagels, pastries, cheeses, cereal, fresh fruit, yogurt, and so much more. Probably the best breakfast continental breakfast I've ever experienced. And the fact that it's steps from your door, means you can head out in your robe. Also included is a nightly HH on the 6th floor where you're treated to a cocktail, glass of wine or beer - all of which are ""top shelf"" choices."
"I stayed at the Kinzie in the Summer of 2014, and have never had such fantastic service and welcoming staff. The location of the hotel is perfect, right in the heart of the action and steps away from the river. The staff was extremely pleasant and helpful and the hotel itself is beautiful. I would recommend the Kinzie hotel to anyone planning on travelling to Chicago. I plan on staying here upon my next visit."
"My husband and I traveled from Dallas to Chicago for a quick weekend getaway. We chose this hotel primarily for it's excellent location (we walked everywhere we went while in Chicago), the amazing prices, and the included breakfast! When we arrived early from our morning flight, they quickly helped us get checked in, stored our luggage, and called my cell as soon as our room was ready. All of the staff was so friendly and everyone was always smiling. There was always someone to greet you at the door.We had a fantastic room, a king corner room on the 6th floor. We enjoyed views of the Trump tower and the Wrigley building. The bed was comfortable, room was clean, and we were right by the lounge area. We took advantage of the breakfast each morning and the nightly happy hour.After we found out our flight back to Dallas was going to be cancelled due to the crazy snowstorm we talked with Monica and she was so helpful in getting us booked for a 3rd night. It was quick to walk anywhere we wanted - the lounge on top of the John Hancock building, Magnificent Mile, Art Institute, Millenium Park, etc. We also enjoyed the proximity of many restaurants - Harry Caray's, Bavette's Bar & Beoff, Frontera Grill, and Eataly to name a few! We will certainly be back to this hotel again and look forward to another great trip to Chicago!


Room Tip: We loved the king corner suite because it gave views in 2 directions.

"I stay here when it was the Almafi, now remodeled and updated to a very modern/contemporary design. The rooms are very nice, bathrooms modern and clean. Very comfortable beds. The evening happy hour was quite nice. One drink ticket, but the cost for an extra drink was very reasonable. Also a nice continental breakfast served on each floor by the elevators. Staff was very nice and helpful. Overall a very good deal for central Chicago"
"Kinzie hotel is an excellent value hotel. The rooms are clean and confortable, they use their space very efficiently. The hotel has a great location, within walking distance of the miracle mile and some other great places in Chicago. They offer some tokens for free drinks at the bar which would provide some warmth before heading out in to the cold downtown streets however this should not be seen as a destination more as the first step towards a night out. Great little hotel that does its job right and does not pretend to be more than it is."
"We have stayed at the Kinzie several times when it was the Amalfi...first time since new ownership and remodeled...love the decor of the rooms...very modern and comfortable...bed was first class...previously the 'happy hour' was unlimited complimentary drinks but now it's only one per person so new ownership has become more 'stingy'...while I don't expect two hours of freebies the cutback...

This was my first time staying at this hotel as I usually stay at Embassy Suites when I'm in Chicago. I must say that everything about the hotel was good. All the staff was very welcoming. When I had go call down to the front desk because there was a problem with the heat; the technician was at the room within 15 minutes and fixed the probkem. The breakfast was nice with a good selection as well as the managers reception every evening. I liked the fact that it lasts a few hours so that you don't feel rushed and that you have to get there rite away. You can definitely tell that the managers make customer service apart of the employees training. I would definitely come back again.
"We have stayed at this hotel several times over the past 4 years and keep coming back, despite the change in ownership and identity.We first stayed at the Kinzie when it was called the Amalfi, and were overwhelmed by the service and extra amenities, like the ""manager's reception"" which featured an open bar with appetizers for several hours each evening, a nice breakfast options on each floor, robes, etc.The hotel has since scaled back the open ""open bar"" manager's reception to an offering of one free drink per night, per guest, controlled by tokens given to guests upon check-in. I can understand the need for this change, because the open bar option was abused by guests and by persons not even staying at the hotel.The service level at the Kinzie seems to have improved, the decor updated, and the breakfast options remain the same. The only significant change seems to be to the previous very liberal ""free drinks"" policy during the evening reception.If you decide to stay, request an upper level room, on the side of the hotel off Kinzie Street. Although you will not have a view, it will be a bit quieter, as Kinzie can be very active throughout the night.


Room Tip: Request a room on the 6th floor, or on the side opposite Kinzie Avenue.

"This was our first trip back since the hotel changed from Amalfi to Kinzie. The remodels are gorgeous; love the modern colors. We were treated so kindly by the staff - Jared and Jerry welcomed us warmly, and got us checked in quickly. They gave us good advice on dining at the Tortoise Club (yummy!). Julian was there in the morning and was exceptionally friendly and helpful as well. Great staff and atmosphere. Oh, and make sure you check in in time for happy hour!"
"We really liked this place. There are a whole lot of little things that add up to making this a great experience. There are complimentary drinks every evening with great little snacks and nibblies. Other reviewers commented on the buffet breakfast available neat the elevators on each floor. It really was a treat to just sneak out in pyjamas and bathrobes (also complimentary), fill up a tray and retreat back to your room to relax and enjoy the breakfast. Add in cookies and hot chocolate in the lobby, extra public washrooms on some of the floors, chairs to sit on at check-in (who likes standing after a long trip?).All the staff here are very professional and attentive. Whenever we had a question we were greeted with smiles and all the advice and suggestions we got was spot-on to our needs.Location is perfect. Easy to walk to North Michigan, the River, the area south of the River, Macy's, etc.. Also great restaurants very close, including Sienna Tavern, Davanti Enoteca and many others. There's also an Einstein Brothers Bagel place on the next block in case you want something more substantial for breakfast.My only (small) suggestion would be to maybe upgrade the mattresses. In our room the mattress seemed to sag slightly a bit at the edge of the bed. This may be a personal taste - I like a hard mattress. Again, this is a very minor point and does not take away from this fabulous hotel.


Room Tip: The rooms facing the street have more of a view than those on the other side of the building.

"this hotel is in a great location. We were able to walk to most of our events. It is small and friendly. The room was very clean and the bed had comfy linens. We did a ton of walking a took a great nap thinking the bed was really nice. However the next morning we both felt different. It wasn't bad just not as comfy as we thought after a full night. They offer breakfast but when we got there it had been raided and it wasn't replenished very fast so we ate elsewhere. They did give out free drink tokens which was nice. We ate lunch at Sienna Tavern. Omg yummy. Go there!! We would consider staying at the hotel again but won't make it a mission.

"The Kinzie hotel was brilliant, the service and check in was quick, polite and efficient. The room we had was excellent, it was large and had a comfortable bed, window seat, and all the room amenities were great. The Kinzie also have a social every evening from 6-8pm where they have snacks and free beverages - including alcohol. The room was spotless and all the staff were really on their A game - polite and really helpful. I highly recommend this hotel. Although the hotel isn't directly off Magnificent Mile, it's only a few blocks away and is very close to all Chicago's main sites. The only negative was the room service food which wasn't great but with plenty of restaurant choice in Chicago and close by to the hotel that shouldn't put you off staying here."
"First things first--the hotel is in a fantastic location in the city. One can easily walk to Michigan Avenue shops, State street shops, the loop, Millenium Park, etc. The River North area is full of wonderful restaurants and bars. We compared prices of lots of hotels in the city and decided on the Kinzie because it wasn't a chain hotel. Continental breakfast was wonderfully presented on each floor, and our reservation came with two free drinks during happy hour. The rooms were beautifully decorated and nicely sized. The real surprise for us was the level of service. Having stayed in many hotels downtown, this was by far the best service I have ever seen. Zuhair helped us with our luggage, and actively engaged my seven year old son. The valet, whose name I didn't catch, went above and beyond to help us get our car when we had problems with our parking arrangements through Spot Hero. Really what made me so happy was everyone we came into contact with treated my son so well. Sometimes establishments don't have the ""time"" for children. I will recommend this hotel and will definitely stay here again. Thank you for your genuine service."
"We stayed here just before Thanksgiving weekend, the weather was cold and windy. The hotel was nice and warm. The Kizie is a great place to stay. We had a corner king which had plenty of room, closet space and good desk space. Bed was comfy and bath was clean and well appointed. We did have breakfast as it was continental style held at the elevator entrance on each floor. If I had any complaint it was that the breakfast was not refilled often enough. Rising at 8 am for breakfast and it was already half empty. We found the hotel right in the middle of many restuarants with lots of choices for any time of the day. Shopping was a bit of a walk, but taxi's are plentiful and not very expensive. I would stay here again and recommend it to anyone look for a good stay at a good price."
"We had my bachelorette in Chicago, where all 14 of us were from out of town. We chose to stay with Kinzie as it looked like a great deal for a boutique hotel in downtown. It was much much much better than we expected! They checked us all in at the same time, no mix ups, no issues. Gave us cold water bottles right when we got in and every time after when we were stepping out of the hotel, took our bags to our rooms. The rooms were beautiful, clean and good enough room, very unique for sure. Always smiling, always helpful, always interacted with us. They location was great, we were walking distance to everything, dinner spots, shopping, clubs, Lincoln park, John Hannock center and much more. I would definitely stay here again and recommend it to anyone traveling to Chicago looking for a place to stay downtown."
"Every Thanksgiving, our family picks a downtown hotel to spend a few nights, do a little shopping and basically enjoy each other's company, since we live in 5 different states and only see each other once a year. We have stayed in 8 other downtown hotels, and the Kinzie has jumped to the top of our list as our favorite. From the continental breakfast enjoyed in your jammies, to the impeccable professionalism and friendliness of every member of the staff, everything was top notch. We can't wait to come back next year!

"We had a flawless experience at the Kinzie. We absolutely loved our room, everything was clean, well-designed, spacious, and first class. The view from our room was incredible, with huge glass windows. The bed was super comfortable and the bathrobes very soft. The service was impeccable and the location was ideal. I would highly recommend the Kinzie to anyone needing a hotel in Chicago. A great plus is the continental breakfast served every morning on each floor by the elevators. You can roll out of bed in your pajamas, grab whatever you want and take it back to your room. Also every evening they have a cocktail hour with free drinks and appetizers. It was a nice touch that made our stay that much more enjoyable.The woman who checked us in at the front desk when we arrived was possibly the friendliest check-in experience we've ever had. They had a plate of fresh cookies and hot apple cider as well. I literally can't think of anything negative about this hotel. If I had to scrounge for something, it would be that the room came with bathrobes but not slippers. Also when I picked up the room phone to call the front desk, there was no explanation written on the phone as to which number to dial to reach the front desk or guest services. Those were the only two ""complaints"" I can think of.I highly recommend the Kinzie hotel and would go back there in a second!

"Overall, a nice place. Friendly staff, nice decor, comfortable beds. I had a few issues with the alleyway noise and some sketchy Wifi service, but it was manageable. The free breakfast isn't gourmet, as listed. It is, however, a very nice treat. The in room Keurig coffee maker was nice, but I never had anything but decaf pods. I did order room service and the food for. Harry Caray's was wonderful and it was delivered quickly."
"This hotel and really really lovely! It is not a massive chain type, but personal and Boutique like. The staff are fun, great at what they do and extremely helpful on all fronts! I loved not having to eat breakfast in a packed breakfast room with other guests. Breakfast buffets are set up on each floor and you ( or in my case my hubby!) take a tray with your chosen food back to your room! The location is ideal, especially when weekends are actually only 2 days!!! Very central yet surprisingly quiet! Chicago is seriously underrated! I will return and wouldn't hesitate to stay in the Kinzy again!"
"There are many hotel choices in Chicago, albeit most of them are in the higher price bracket. The Kinzie Hotel (formerly the Amalfi) remains independent and unique.Two things are distinct pluses. As mentioned elsewhere, the evening reception is a cut above most ""manager's receptions,"" with generosity in food and beverage selections much appreciated.

"Stayed three nights for a trade show.The bed was as comfortable as they get. Everything in the room (like a mini suite)was very nice. The bathroom was very nice. Breakfast served on every floor.....yogurt, breads, fruit, cheese, eggs, good coffee. Free drinks and antipasto are served on the 6th floor early evenings.Harry Caray's is across the street. House of Blues is 1/2 block away. The place is surrounded by nice restaurants. It's a quick cab ride to McCormick place.This is a smaller 6 story hotel where the attention to detail is great.I stayed here with my family several times back when it was the Amalfi and the hotel has improved as the Kinzie.The staff truly gets it. I have another trade show in Chicago in two weeks and I'll stay at the Kinzie again.

"I stayed at the Kinzie Hotel for one evening to get some rest after a flight from London. The hotel is ideally located in the city. About a five-minute walk from the Magnificent Mile, and maybe a 10-15 minute walk to the Loop (depending on where you are going). There are some great bars and restaurants on Kinzie Street (one of my favorites, Mercadito, is about a five-minute walk away).Unfortunately, the hotel itself is not as great as its location. Check-in was fine, although I can't say the front desk staff were incredibly enthusiastic with regard to assisting me. I booked a king room through an independent hotel booking site, but was placed in a handicap room with two queen beds on the sixth floor (Room 618). That wasn't a big issue for me as I was traveling alone, but please make sure that you receive the room you actually booked if you want a king bed. The room is located right around the corner from the elevators. This caused two huge issues for me. First, the door is thin, so you can hear the elevator ""ding"" each time it arrives and departs. Even worse, the hotel sets up a breakfast in the lobby in front of the elevator each morning. I wanted rest when I arrived - I did not want to be woken up at 6:30 a.m. by glass clinking while the staff set up the breakfast. I guess it's a convenience for the remaining rooms on the floor to have a breakfast table so close, but for the 4-8 rooms that are closest to the breakfast table, it's a major annoyance to deal with sounds from the breakfast in the morning. I would suggest that you ensure that your room is not located close to the elevator (or perhaps the hotel will move breakfast to a conference room or a more convenient location that will allow ALL of their guests to rest).The bed was comfortable, and the windows were relatively soundproof despite the nightlife outside. The room, however, definitely needed some TLC. There was a hole near the bottom of the wall in the hallway, and a tear on the seat in the bathroom. Additionally, the bathtub was rusty, and the toilet had a flushing problem (at times, it would continually flush without stopping). On the plus side, the hotel happily watched my luggage while I shopped the next day. It would have been nice to be asked at checkout, however, about my stay. I'll find another hotel the next time I stay in the city."
"This boutique style hotel had one thing that stood out - customer service. The staff were SUPER friendly and helpful, and a good part of what made the stay enjoyable.The included morning breakfast (continental style, no hot foods) and a wonderful nightly happy hour with light appetizers and a few included drinks were additional highlights.The rooms themselves are modern, beautifully appointed (a bit trendy), and incredibly clean. They were pretty much true to what was pictured online, except keep in mind that this hotel occupies the first 6 floors of some kind of business building. So you're not getting sweeping skyline views which may be suggested by the tower that's pictured for the hotel. Also, some of the of the pictures highlight rooms with large curved windows overlooking the city - these are actually the two room suites. The standard/deluxe rooms are smaller and most with not particularly great views. It IS possible to upgrade to king rooms with corner windows, that have slightly better city views. Wifi included!Lastly, location of hotel is fantastic. On State and Kinzie streets, within walking distance to Michigan Mile shopping and Trump towers, boat tours (Wendella) and lots of delicious restaurants. Made for a great weekend visit!"
"We stayed during Labour Day weekend and picked this hotel based on its location to Millenium Park for the Jazz festival, to the Mag Mile for shopping and to the South Loop for more shopping. We arrived and were promptly greeted and offered a refreshing drink of naturally flavoured water at the front desk (though the staff do their intake while sitting down and guests have to look down at them...a tad odd).This was our third trip to Chicago in four years and the best hotel we've stayed at...especially since were also celebrating our anniversary. Our room overlooked the street and provided amusing entertainment from the hotel across the street due to the large windows - we just had to remember to close the blinds so we didn't return the favour! The room was very comfortable from the space, to the bed to the ammenities. Each morning we enjoyed our breakfast (high carb) on the couch while planning our day.Next time we return to Chicago, we will most likely stay here again. Thank you!

"I travel to Chicago often and had the opportunity to stay over the weekend for a family trip. We stumbled upon the Kinzie. My wife, a hotel snob, was unimpressed because it is owned by Amalfi which is often less than 4 stars. However, we were pleasantly surprised. The hotel staff was very friendly and genuine. The accommodations and hotel are a boutique flavor, so it has to be in your palate. Everything was nice with a breakfast bar and hospitality club before dinner.


Room Tip: The choice is basic views of the city street.

"The Kinzie is in a great central location for getting around the various tourist attractions, shops and restaurants within Chicago. We enjoyed walking for miles to see all the famous sights. We were initially placed in a corner room on 6th floor but it was immediately across from another building with huge air conditioning units on top which my husband found quite noisy so we asked to swap and Jose kindly sorted out a move to an alternative room for us. We were on 4th floor which does mean that you will still hear traffic as the hotel is in a great location - I think the top floor is 6 so it will be hard to avoid noise, so if you're a light sleeper it might not be the best choice of hotel. My husband needs to use ear plugs at night anyway and he found this fine. I did hear some sirens and horns but it certainly wasn't constant but is possibly a very slight negative against the hotel but can't be helped. Otherwise the hotel is great, staff are welcoming and friendly - doormen were great fun! The continental breakfast is ideal to set you up for the day (cereal, toast, bagels, pastries and donuts, fruit and yoghurt, juice and teas) - although it would be nice to have somewhere to sit and eat it other than in your room but it's fine for a few days. The evening reception is great - free cocktails (2 choices) & beer (312 by local Goose Island brewery) with tokens provided at check in. There were also nibbles - we didn't get an opportunity to go every night but thoroughly enjoyed it along with the opportunity to speak to other guests. The room was really clean and modern, although it did seem minimal space for storing clothes if you were staying for a longer period of time. I had contacted the hotel via Facebook prior to visiting the city as we had booked to enjoy a late anniversary trip and the hotel very kindly provided us with chocolate covered strawberries and champagne which was a lovely touch, especially as they also have me a hand written note to thank me for getting in touch. Customer services is definitely a key within the hotel. Overall, would certainly return to the hotel as it had loads of great benefits and was in a perfect location to travel around the city by foot."
"Booked this hotel for a weekend in Chicago when there was a huge convention and the usual hotels we stay at were priced out of range. What a lovely surprise! The Kinzie staff were super friendly, check-in was quick even though we were there early. Room was fine - no view - with comfortable bed and couch. Nice idea to have continental breakfast on each floor. They even had hard cooked eggs for us Atkins folk! The location of the hotel is great - on State and Kinzie - with everything Chicago has to offer close by. I would certainly consider this again for our next visit."
"We had a lovely experience - hospitable, well mannered staff - from the valet to the front desk, to the housekeeping629 - corner room- great view - stylish furnishings - cool electric sliding blinds - very comfortable beds - and importantly, an actual door separating the bedroom from the living room giving us privacy from the boys sleeping on the pullout sofa. And outlets near your bed for your phone - not fifty feet away (a pet peeve) . You are facing directly into the windows of other hotels, though, so strategic use of those blinds will be necessary.What was especially nice were the extras - free FAST Wifi - wifi is often promised at other hotels but rarely is consistent. This is the ONLY hotel in which my son did not complain about the WiFi.Continental breakfast - I think a very generous spread, especially for the middle of a big city - danish, donuts, bagels, bread, cereal, juices, teas, coffee, apples, oranges, bananas, yogurt, milk and my favorite - a little protein - hard boiled eggs. Finding these kind of ""home-y"" items in the middle of the city would have cost 30 dollars. Being able to tiptoe down the hall and have these items ready for the kids without having even to get them out of bed was a HUGE help in keeping moods light. PLUS the evening cocktails were accompanied by antipasto - also very helpful when the kids are getting peckish, but you are not quite ready to go out for the evening. And you don't have to have a cocktail - a complimentary soda or juice is also offered.Tip: The valet usually would get the car faster than 15 minutes, but if you are on a tight schedule, call and arrange for the car 15 minutes or so in advance of your departure. This is not unreasonable - when I lived in a condo on Lake Shore Drive, this was customary. Is there city noise? Yes. But that is because you are in the city, not because the hotel is remiss. If you want to be in a convenient location, but have a more unique boutique experience, Kinzie is a great option. I would absolutely stay here again."
"We stayed in the Kinzie for 4 nights before travelling to the Big Apple. The staff are welcoming and the hotel is spotlessly clean. The breakfast was a bonus and was served on each floor and then taken to your room. It wasn't a hot cooked breakfast but still adequate and enjoyable. We stayed on the third floor at the side of the hotel and our only complaint was the noise from the bars in the street below. The noise kept us awake for a couple of nights. It maybe better to request a higher room if you want to sleep well. The rooms are quite spacious, we had a corner window with a couch so we were able to watch the action outside.Would visit the Kinzie again but in another room."
"From the second you hit the door you are pampered in a beautiful setting. From the doormen, to the staff that checks you in to the cleaning staff, everyone shares the same ethos of perfection in service. The location of the property ideal in the heart of River North in downtown Chicago. Virtually everywhere yu want to go is walkable. The room was beautifully appointed and immaculate. The lobby is small so breakfast is served on each floor across from the elevators. The food was delicious and there were plenty of choices. The business center was far superior to many comparable properties. I plan on staying at the Kinzie for all future stays. Each room has a small refrigerator which was very helpful. Wifi was free and fast. I confined to be impressed with every element of my stay,

"I booked this room for a weekend away from Groupon.Love the modern ambiance. Had a great Happy Hour Mingle room and everybody was extremely pleasant. Wish they had a spa, I bet it would be great! The complementary, breakfast was nice. Located on every floor by the elevators. Coffee, tea, juice bagels, muffins, fruit, cheese, eggs. Great lil restaurant called mercadidtos next door.Room was small but okay. The bed was super comfy and Carpet was old and had ripples in it and the wallpaper in the bathroom was peeling. The ""blackout drapes"" didn't close. Not because they were broken, they just weren't designed to. The desk chair was disgusting to sit on. Tiny old school fridge that needed defrosting. The fan in the bathroom was broken but there was double shower heads. Not sure why, but okay."
"as a group of people we stayed in this hotel from Apr 18-20. all was excellent from booking stages over the email and phone to arrival, check into the rooms. rooms were great and clean, service excellent, breakfast very good. Location is so good, that you do not need transportation, all main attractions are around hotel.

"Loved this hotel, very well positioned for most of the major attractions in Chicago. Staff were wonderful, the room was amazing, really clean and the best bathroom towels going. The breakfast was really good and you can have as much as you like, with fresh juices, coffee etc and plenty of choices of food. The free evening drinks was a really good idea. We felt totally looked after all the time we were there."
"The Kinzie presents a compelling value proposition for those who want an excellent, unique place to stay without enduring the ridiculous prices, general snobbery, and lack of personal service found at nearby upscale chain hotels.During the business portion of a trip to Chicago in August, my wife and I stayed at one of those upscale chains. After the conference was over, and vacation time began, we hopped across the river to the Kinzie, and we were amazed at the difference. Let's compare:* The upscale chain wanted $27 per person per day for a minimalist, allegedly continental breakfast.* At the Kinzie, a continental breakfast is free. And it's served on every floor of the hotel.* The upscale chain scoffs at the notion of in-room coffee without overcharging for the service.* The Kinzie provides an in-room Keurig, and they're happy to give extra k-cups if you need them.* The upscale chain wanted $15 per day for internet service.* The Kinzie gives it to you for free.* The upscale chain charged $100 more per night.* The Kinzie was reasonably priced and provided a room that was roughly 50% larger.* The upscale chain had sparse staff who were somewhat aloof.* The Kinzie treats you like an actual guest - as though you're a friend visiting town, and they're excited to welcome you in.* The upscale chain had the standard upscale bar.* The Kinzie provides a free evening reception with cocktails and hors d'oeuvre.* Need a cab at the upscale chain? Sure, as long as someone's there to call it into the loading area.* Need one at the Kinzie? No worries; the always-on-hand, friendly bellman will take care of that.Sure, the Kinzie has a couple of cons and oddities:* The hotel only occupies the bottom six floors of its building, so street noise can be a factor on nights like Friday and Saturday as young socialites spill into the street from nearby bars and clubs.* The L is about four blocks away, which can be moderately annoying if you're taking advantage of public transportation.* The corner suites are great on space, but perhaps some of that hallway width could have been apportioned to the bathroom instead.* Elevator ""bells"" sound strikingly akin to the bird whose tail gets yanked and squawks quittin' time in the ""Flintstones"" opening.Cartoon bird reminders aside, we look forward to returning the Kinzie whenever we're in Chicago. And when we do, we'll feel like we're among friends.

"Within walking distance of subway stops, terrific restaurants, and the Miracle Mile shopping district, this hotel was a great find. The new owners did a great job renovating the old Amalfi hotel. The rooms are comfortable and stylishly furnished. They kept the old tub and tub fixtures, but other than that everything seems to have been repainted and refurnished. I wouldn't call it a ""luxury"" hotel necessarily but it's definitely a stylish boutique hotel. Request a room on a top floor away from the hotel elevators and the sixth floor lounge. The hotel offers a complimentary continental breakfast and staff set it out on each floor just outside the elevators. Folks stumble out of the rooms to get coffee and danish and you can hear their conversation and the clanging of plates. The walls are pretty thin so you can also hear your neighbor open and close the blinds, flush the toilet, etc. however these are minor complaints. The staff are super friendly and the location is just great. I will definitely stay here again."
"centrally located, this hotel is close to all the major sites, to the river, Millenium park etc. It is surrounded by restaurants, coffee shops, and what not,so we enjoyed being at the center of things. Staff friendly and helpful. Room spacious clean and comfortable with great insulation so we slept like angels....very nice idea of serving breakfast on the floor loby, though sometimes it was hilarious to chase the coffee on one floor and the milk on another but really no drama. small intimate and very welcoming.

"We spent four nights at the Kinzie hotel. Overall, it was a decent hotel in an excellent location. The continental breakfast consisted of coffee/tea/juice, a variety of breads, pastries, yogurt and fruit. It was centrally located on every floor. After four days, the choices did become slightly repetitive, but we still found it convenient. The rooms were average sized and had very comfortable king sized beds. Each room came with two bath robes. Unfortunately, one of ours went missing after housekeeping the first day and was never replaced. We had some other issues with the housekeeping services in that our soap bars were never replenished and we had multiple 9am knocks to see if the room had been vacated for cleaning.The hotel also has a reception with drinks and appetizers each night, which we did not have a chance to check out. The Kinzie is situated in a great location to experience downtown Chicago and the hotel staff were friendly and accommodating. Apart from some minor issues, it was an enjoyable stay."
"I've stayed at the Kinzie several times, including several as the Amalfi, and the hotel has a great location and is nicely furnished and the staff is quite helpful. It is nice to have the little cocktail hour where you can relax over a drink or two before heading out for dinner or a show.

"We booked a very affordable stay at Kinzie and received a 4+ stay! The hotel is very clean, comfortable and conveniently located. The continental breakfast was fabulous and a super convenience allowing us to get out early to explore the wonderful city of Chicago. The lounge with drinks and snacks is soo very well done. Concierge were always very pleasant and helpful. Would definitely stay again. Highly recommended too."
"This may have been the best hotel stay my wife and I have ever had. The small lobby has 2 persons sitting at a low desk. They function as both receptionists and concierges. As a concierge, they always have the right answer about visiting the sites or choosing a restaurant. And, there is never a line at the front desk or at the elevators.The rooms are spacious, clean, and well organized. A unique feature is their included breakfast, which is served on every floor. That means you can go for your food and take it back to your room, if you desire. In the evening, there is a complementary reception with snack foods as well as beer, wine, and hard liquor.Valet parking is expensive, but no different than at any other near downtown hotel. This hotel is listed as being in River North, which is close to everywhere you might want to go. In addition, this has the largest concentration of fine restaurants that I have ever seen. All in all, this added up to some great meals.The people are friendly and very helpful, in addition to the hotel's great location. We can't wait to come back.


Room Tip: If you are sensitive to city noise, request a room on a high floor and in the back of the hotel.

"On our recent visit to Chicago We stayed (3sisters) at the Kinzie. Not only were the rooms immaculately designed..marvelous beds etc, but the staff treated us like QUEENS. From the moment we arrived MEG and Julian were outstanding along with Rafti who met us at the curb and immediately took our car and belongings to the appropriate spots. We were not allowed to lift a finger. The customer service was outstanding. The park and go rates were terrific. Harry Caray's was right across the street. Check out was effortless with 3 credit cards, no questions asked. We feel it is the best hotel in Chicago and we are pretty fussy!! Actually I didn't want to admit to the ""best stay"" in Chicago because we always want them to have a room available for us on our next stay. So Don't let the word out. Basically the STAFF was tremendous.Kudos to the management for selecting and training such a wonderful, personable staff.Until next time..can't wait.Surprise..an intimate experience in the heart of Chicago."
"We recently stayed here from Fri-Mon. We were on the 2nd floor on the north side of the building. Didn't hear any bar noise. I'm guessing for those who did hear the bars their rooms they were in the front portion of the hotel facing Kinzie St. Quick 3 or 4 block walk to Red Line and vice versa south to the river. Really nice rooms and just convenient for everything we wanted. Flying into O'Hare, jump on the Blue Line to the stop just before the Loop and grab a cab from there. Save about $40 in total depending on traffic.


Room Tip: Choose room on North side

"We stayed at the Kinzie this past weekend. The room and hotel are beautiful, the doormen are super friendly. However it was impossible to sleep in our room as the noise from the bar behind the building could be heard through the walls even in the bathroom with the door closed. The noise stopped around 5 a.m. Not a nice place to try and get a good night's sleep. So if you are booking this hotel request a quiet side of the hotel room. I mentioned this to the girl behind the desk when we checked out and she said I should have known this and requested the quiet side of the hotel when I booked. Not the answer form her I expected. We have stayed here many times before and did not experience the noise issue. Quite a letdown for our 40th Anniversary.

"Stayed at the Kinzie for 5 nights in August and what a great hotel it is! The room was spacious, clean & modern with everything you need. All staff were helpful & pleasant & the added bonus of a free drink every evening in the small cocktail bar was most welcome! Self service breakfast on each floor allowing residents to enjoy a leisurely breakfast in their own room was different & may not appeal to everybody; we loved it! Excellent central location with many bars & restaurants in the vicinity and a 2 minute walk from the 'L'. Free wifi too! Great value for money & would definitely stay here again."
"The Kinzie is a nicely located, and well run independent hotel in the River North neighborhood of downtown Chicago. Although it does not have a large lobby or amenities of many larger, chain hotels, it is a contemporary, attractive, personally-friendly and comfortable property. In the case of our stay, it was also an excellent value for the three nights that we stayed there. As guests, we very much appreciated the personal attention and hospitality we received from nearly everyone on staff, including a very attentive young bellman named Gerry, who was eager to make our stay more enjoyable. The complementary breakfast arrangement is very efficiently arranged, as it is set up on every floor adjacent to the elevators, for easy access from one's room. In the late afternoon/evenings, the hotel offers a complimentary happy hour including cocktails and light hors d'oeuvres on the top floor. The bartender does a nice job managing this every evening. While there is no bar or restaurant located within the hotel, there are many choices located in easy walking distance within the River North neighborhood. The rooms were comfortable and well appointed, albeit not particularly large. We will return to the Kinzie for future stays when we visit Chicago.


Room Tip: Ask for rooms on the side/floor that do not look directly into the office building less than 50 feet...

We stayed for 3 nights 11th to 14th August. The staff were most helpful and pleasant. The bed was super comfortable. Everything was spotlessly clean. Breakfast was buffet style available on all floors and you brought it back to the room. Unusual but great. WIFI was free and Concierge was really good (from Sri Lanka and ordered our taxi for six people at a decent rate. Hotel is near to boat cruise and tour pickup points - just past the Trump tower and over the bridge. Would definitely return and will recommend to friends who may be visiting Chicago.
"We had a very good stay. Very clean, new furnishings, comfortable beds. In a great location. You can walk to most of the architecture gems along the river. No need to pay for the tours.Gym was ok. Could have used some resistance bands and an exercise ball, but adequate overall.Breakfast is continental and served on your floor to take back to your room. As continental goes, above average.Overall, we'd come back and recommend"
"My husband and I first visited the Kinzie hotel during our first visit to Chicago in 2009 when we were dating. The location was amazing, the staff were extremely helpful and we loved the continental breakfast and cocktail hour that was included. The rooms are very comfortable and charming. Fast forward four years to 2013, my now husband was planning to propose and decided that he had to bring me back to Chicago and the Kinzie hotel! He woke me up and told me we were going on a road trip and when we arrived in Chicago 7 hours after departing Toronto and pulled into the Kinzie hotel I was thrilled! Needless to say, the Kinzie hotel is a very special place and we very much look forward to going back to celebrate many anniversaries!"
"We stayed at the Kinzie last week for 4 nights for our honeymoon. We had an amazing stay! The staff were so friendly and attentive. When we arrived we were early and our room wasn't quite ready. We left for about an hour for lunch (while they held our luggage for us!) and when we came back it still wasn't ready. However, they got us into another room right which was wonderful! Everytime we entered or exited the hotel we were greeted and told to have a wonderful day. Just a nice touch that you don't get at larger hotels. We were on the 5th floor with a street view and of Harry Caray's Steakhouse restaurant. The location is fantastic. We walked to pretty much everywhere we wanted to go (except Wrigley Field and Union Station). At check in we had some troubles with our Canadian credit/debit cards working and they were very accommodating. The same issues came up on our second last day, and again they were extremely accommodating and friendly while we solved the issue.They were aware it was our honeymoon, and when we returned from the Cubs game on our first night, we were greeted with a bottle of sparkling wine and chocolate covered strawberries along with a lovely note congratulating us on our marriage. Again, so nice.The bed was SO comfortable, and while the room was not huge there was everything you needed and everything was very stylish and updated. The extra perks made the stay. The continental breakfast on each floor was great. It wasn't something that we wanted every morning but had it a few times. There was juice, donuts, bagels, muffins, coffee, tea (all kinds of tazo tea), fruit etc. The reception from 5-8 was wonderful! They had different snacks (cheese, meat, bread etc) as well as a full bar. I was expecting small drinks and little selection however, this was NOT the case.Overall, I highly recommend staying at the Kinzie, it was a great experience and much more reasonably priced than other alternatives. I will be staying at the Kinzie again, and will be recommending it to anyone I know travelling to Chicago!


Room Tip: Ask for a higher floor - and a corner room would be nice!

"This is a beautiful hotel in a perfect location .. You can walk to most of the best locations in the city ... The rooms at the Kinzie are very nice and well decorated.. It provides a breakfast every morning and has happy hour every evening. You receive a free drink token when you check in. Another bright spot with this hotel is the staff ""especially the check in staff"".. It was perfect for a weekend in the city.."
"Staying at the Kinzie is a great way to introduce yourself to Chicago and immerse yourself immediately into the food and art scene of the downtown area. Location is very convenient for exploring and ambling around.It's a small boutique hotel with a clean, modern vibe that's warmly welcoming...a feeling I thought was whimsically represented by the minty-blue H2O+ square soap sitting on the cool, stark white dish in our bathroom. The grey/white walls are decorated with framed photographs of vintage scenes as well as fun modern art pieces which could include the funky furniture in the lobby. The Kinzie staff is friendly and attentive, always greeting you on the way in and out. The bellhops are very dapper in their light grey uniforms and fedoras. Fresh fruit flavored water is available in the lobby.Yays:- Free breakfast is served on each floor from 6:30 to 10 am, set up right across from the elevators. How convenient is that? You'll see your neighbors in their white bathrobes out examining the continental breakfast choices: pastries, bagels, breads, cereal, fruit, hard boiled eggs, coffee, juice, tea, yogurt. There's a white tray in your room that you can take with you to carry all your selections back for a leisurely breakfast in bed moment. - The free Manager's reception in the evenings is on the 6th floor with open bar (you're given a token for a free drink when you register) and a tasty assortment of appetizers. It's a low-lit, intimate setting with bar tables and chairs.- Everything was clean and comfortable...the room, beds, decor.- Our room had two queen beds-- a choice not offered at many hotels but very appreciated by families.- Location is excellent: great access to restaurants and Michigan Avenue. 5 minute walk to Grand metro station where you can catch the Red line to Wrigley Field, 10 minute walk to Millenium Park (""Bean"", Cloud Gate) and a little further to the fantastic Art Institute of Chicago museum. - Considering the hotel is on a main street right in the middle of downtown, you would think you'd hear a lot more street noise. Our room was on the 5th floor and we heard more from the ice machine across the hallway. There is street noise, just not as much as expected.- The small gym is located on the 5th floor which was very convenient for us.Nays:- We traveled at peak time so prices were higher, but still better than many other hotels nearby.- That we couldn't stay longer!Interesting:- Kinzie has a very pet-friendly policy with rooms and services geared towards furry guests. For those of us who are unfortunately allergic to man's best friend, you should ask for rooms on the non-pet floors.Staying at the Kinzie helped make our visit to Chicago more enjoyable and accessible...would definitely come back!"
"This boutique hotel is conveniently located to Michigan Ave. and the magnificent mlle, Millennium Park, and many restaurants. The rooms were clean, attractively decorated, and quiet. The late afternoon cocktail party with a complimentary drink and appetizers is worth making time for. There were also complimentary cookies at the front desk in mid afternoon.

"This was our 2nd stay at the Kinzie and now that it's completely remodeled, we had a wonderful experience. The room with a king size bed and a large bathroom was comfortable and quiet. Breakfast was included, with a nice choice of fruits, grains, yogurts, cheeses and beverages. The evening cocktail hour was also a plus, with great wines and appetizers. Katie Russell our hostess was exceptional and offered several ideas for great restaurants. The bellmen were courteous and helpful as we loaded and departed in heavy rain. One unexpected perk: after the repairman fixed the running toilet on the morning of our 2nd day, he left us two large chocolate wrenches...very tasty Charlie! thanks for your great hospitality.

"Our 1st visit to chicago and we got a late deal for the kinzie hotel on kinzie st between State & Dearborn st.The hotel is very nice and great location for shopping State st & The Magnificent Mile. Also an easy walk to the Navy Pier.They also provide a very good complimentary continental breakfast on each floor.They rooms were a good size with good bathroom & very clean too.On checking in we were given tokens to avail of free drinks in the bar too, an unexpected surprise.We loved our 1st visit to chicago and it was only improved by the hotel & staff at the kinzie.I hope to return."
"We stayed here over July 3rd and had an absolutely wonderful experience. We arrived early and luckily our corner room was ready. Went to the ""Bean"" and stopped to hear the Chicago Symphony rehearse then we went to the Field Museum and when we returned to the hotel there were freshly made cookies. We went to the sixth floor where 2 drinks per person plus appetizers were included in our rate. The next morning there was a nice breakfast by the elevators that you could bring back to your room. All members of the staff were exceptionally friendly.

"Just stayed at the Kinzie July 11-13 and it was great. First thing is that it is only a block away from the Blue Line Subway (EL) that comes from O'Hare airport (Clark & Lake exit). Its a 30-40 minute train ride but for $2.50 each its good. The bed was comfortable, room was clean, blinds covered the windows well so it was dark and the noise was next to nil. Slept really well there. All the personnel were exceptionally polite and welcoming. Jose at the front desk was great for giving us ideas where to eat and advising on some attractions. Everything is walking distance in my opinion as we were close to the ""magnificent mile"", Millennium Park, Art Museum and the river where the boat tours start from. They do a appetizer/drink 5-8 up on the 6th floor which was nice as it held you over before you go out for dinner. Complimentary drink and food (cut up veggies, cheese, sliced meats) were a nice treat. The gym is really clean with 1 recumbent bike, couple treadmills, elliptical, and couple weight machines as well as some free weights. Overall I would recommend this hotel and will be going back again for sure."
"Travelled with sixteen ladies from our Bookclub to experience Chicago and it started on the right foot by choosing to stay at this incredible hotel. Location, location, location! Inexpensive cab fare from the train station and we could walk to most tourist sights, close to awesome shopping and dining in safe and beautiful neighbourhood. Clean crisp modern hotel with the most friendly staff, handsome and helpful doormen and all staff said hello first and nothing was too much trouble including the maid service. Breakfast served on each floor so walking out in one of the provided bathrobes to get a coffee and juice was no problem. Hard boiled eggs and lovely chocolate croissants and yogurts and fruits and all types of items to toast. Started the day off right in such a convenient manner. Happy hour each evening with one free drink and appetizers provided, ( I'm talking prosciutto wrapped asparagus not chips and dip) rooms were very clean, smelled good, bathrooms were immaculate and towels smelled fresh, beds were super comfy. Slept well every night even in the middle of a noisy metropolis. We will definitely stay here again! No need to look any where else !

"This hotel is in a great location. I wanted to see the downtown in night and this hotel was in perfect location even though they don't have rooms in the upper floors. Staff was good and room was super clean. Evening drinks were really nice ;)Only issue I had was - I called the hotel in the morning to check if I can check in early at 11. They said it's ok and can come. When I went there room was not ready and we'd to wait nearly till 3 PM with small kids. I hope they will be more sensible in future.

"I was traveling to The Langham Chicago (5-star hotel) for business with a group and gave up my room there for one of my clients when we learned that hotel was overbooked. The Kinzie is located just around the corner and the Langham booked me there. At first I thought the Kinzie looked cheap/chintzy online and I was concerned but my Langham contact assured me it had just been refurbished/updated. My room was clean, the furnishings were new, the bed linens were of good quality, and the robes were nice. The long counter ""desk"" made it easy to spread out my work and get a lot done. They set up a breakfast buffet in the elevator foyer area on every floor each morning - coffees, juices, cereals, yogurts, muffins/pastries, toaster w/breads & bagels, whole fruit, string cheese. There's also a lounge on the 6th floor and you're given a coin good for 1 drink for each night of your stay. Due to business commitments I was not able to visit the lounge but I did peek in to check it out and it seemed fairly nice - fun lighting, big screen TV, variety of seating/tables - and it was busy. The cons of The Kinzie are minimal: small closet, I could hear the ppl in the room next to me raising and lowering their shades, could also hear what I assume to be construction noise well into the night even with earplugs.


Room Tip: The lounge is on the 6th floor.

"Very clean, great location and nice free continental breakfast on each floor.Nice optional place for breakfast around the corner at bin61Funny, I left tip money under the pillow for the maid and she did not take it and left in on the table instead.Like all Hotels the parking was expensive $55Good Hotel if you want to keep it simple without paying all the extras like swimming pool ect.I would go back."
"If you're looking for a well-positioned boutique hotel for a short stay in the downtown area of Chicago, then look no further than Kinzie Hotel. Ask for a room on the highest floor possible and in the back if you can handle the darkness with which you might be faced, but that will allow you to avoid the yelling revellers complained of my another review. Some great deals can be had for this property if you know how to use some of the online discount booking services.TL;DR, Kinzie Hotel is comfortable, welcoming and well-run. Recommended."
"First off the products H2O are wonderful! Really fresh and love the shower every time we visit what can be a grimy city sometimes. While on my out to shop, Meg the concierge told me all the great places to go and that old navy was having their famous one day $1 flip flop sale and went out of her why to surprise me with a pair when she found out that I went the other direction and missed it to watch Colombia in the World Cup ! Melissa the front house manager is completely on it! She made sure we had all the extras we request and informed us about their new ""we get it"" policy which I'm a big fan of with all our travels. Thanks again for a wonderful, local stay!"
"We stayed in the Kinzie on the last leg of our trip to the US.The room was large and clean with coffee-maker and snacks.We availed of the complementary breakfast each morning which unusually was served on each floor.We also enjoyed the Happy Hour each evening when drinks and hors d oeuvres were served.The hotel is very well located - close to all attractions and transport links and is close to many bars and restaurants.We were particularly impressed by the check-in staff - polite and friendly. We felt that we were treated very fairly when our flight into Chicago was cancelled at very short notice and subsequently our cancellation call to the hotel was literally at the 11th hour.On check-out the cost of our first night was deducted which is not often the case in other hotels who use the small print to take as much as possible.We would certainly stay here again and would recommend the Kinzie to anyone visiting the Windy City.


Room Tip: This is a city-centre hotel and some street noise is inevitable,but was not a problem.

"We stayed here over the Thanksgiving holiday weekend to attend the parade and go shopping. The hotel used to be called the Amalfi and is now the Kinzie. Room was great and clean, staff were wonderful. We didn't know about the Manager's Happy Hour until we checked it and this became something we attended daily, just so we wouldn't miss it! Great snacks and drinks, very generous! It was nice to interact with other hotel guests too. Most hotels don't have such a nice free feature and we really enjoyed it each night of our stay. Walking was easy and felt safe, close to good bars and places to eat.


Room Tip: Don't miss the daily happy hour! Staff is wonderful, ask them anything and they will help you...

"We stayed at the Kinzie for a split week in June. Five nights followed by a break and return for four nights. The staff handled our departure and return smoothly, promptly and with great attention to detail. Moreover the valet staff and staff assistants provided every service we requested with speed and equanimity. Buffet continental breakfast is beautifully presented and everything tastes delicious. They use a really good bakery!Our beautifully appointed corner room was comfortable, light from huge windows, great view of the city. The bathroom is roomy, great shower and terrific, large towels. The corner was a great way to stash our belongings without cluttering the room itself.Our only misgiving is that these rooms are really too tight for extended stays. While we were there the great service made up for this, but we would not plan our annual two week visit to Chicago at this hotel. Short stays are great. We were taken care of like royalty.

Having breakfast right outside our room and the complimentary happy hour makes this our number one choice for our stays in Chicago from now on!!!.

"This was my first stay at the Kinzie. The staff was fantastic and extremely welcoming. Every day when I arrived, they greeted me and asked if there was anything I needed. The room was very clean and modern. Most importantly for me, the bed was especially comfortable. I appreciated the complimentary wine and appetizers at the manager's reception and the free breakfast was very convenient. There are plenty of dining options within a very short walking distance. The only issue I had was the noise from outside. I'm guessing it was because I was on the 4th floor and so close to the street. I wish they had a vending machine or some way to get a soda without leaving the hotel. Granted, there is a 7-11 just around the corner, so not a deal breaker. Even with the noise issue I would definitely stay there again.


Room Tip: I would try to get a room as high as you can. I think this would reduce the noise from the street.

"Stayed two nights for business and was very pleased. Rooms were nice and the love seat and ottoman a great plus. Comfortable bed with nice linens and large counter space in bathroom with magnifying mirror. The cocktail/appetizer reception another bonus especially since it goes until 8pm. We found them to be very popular. Also a great benefit to only have to walk to elevator to grab breakfast. Although no eggs or hot food there was a big variety of scones, muffins, toast, bagels, cheese, croissants, yogurt, cereal, etc. All of that with great service. Hard to beat."
"Spent a couple of nights here for work - great location for nightlife and access to business district. Chicago is such a great city and the location lets you make the most of it all. Breakfast included is great with decent selection - served on each floor in the lift lobby and you take the food back to you room. Rooms were spacious, clean and service friendly. Look forward to coming back again in future - only minor downside is some rooms are noisy due their location being next to adjacent buildings - but not enough of a deterrent. Will be back!"
"I was a little wary about staying in the same hotel for a second time, especially as it has changed name and been refurbished since our last visit however we were not disappointed & so glad we came back! This hotel is second to none. The staff are friendly & helpful, the location is incredible, surrounded by some of the best restaurants & bars in Chicago and the complimentary breakfast each morning is a very nice (and rare) bonus. Rooms haven't changed in size but the decor is bright, fresh & spacious. Oh and did I mention the happy hour every evening from 5-8pm?! A great way to start an evening out. I will continue to recommend this hotel to everyone I know!

"Fabulous find in River North! Great renovation. Modern boutique hotel. Loved the complimentary breakfast each morning and especially the complimentary cocktail reception each night! Nice location in the heart of river north and close to mag mile shopping. Wifi is also included. One downside was the noise. We stayed in a suite on the 3rd floor and the entire wall was windows, which was beautiful, but noisy. We stayed over memorial day weekend and it was noisy every night. So if you can ask for a higher floored room do. Besides that, no other complaints. Great, newly renovated, boutique hotel.


Room Tip: Ask for a room on higher level. The lower floors are close to busy, noisy streets.

"The excellent reviews for this property convinced me that it was worth a try during a particularly busy period in downtown hotels. It was very expensive - but so was everything else in this hotel's class.The check-in was efficient but rather indifferent (a bit surprising given the praise for front desk staff in previous reviews). The room was fine: certainly not huge, probably average by Chicago standards. I found it dark, particularly because most of the wallpaper was grey or charcoal. It was nicely outfitted, though, with a loveseat and large ottoman, plenty of power outlets, and a Keurig coffeemaker. (Unfortunately, I was only provided with one pod for regular coffee.)The free continental breakfast left by the elevators in the mornings was a disappointment quality-wise, but at least the free wifi was reliable and a decent speed.Biggest plus for this property: Definitely the location. Biggest negative: The street noise, particularly the loud music at local bars. I was on the second floor and could even hear arguments between people in the alley that my room overlooked. You'll definitely want to ask for a higher floor!"
"I was staying for a convention and was very pleased with the hotel and the surrounding neighborhood. Everything you need is nearby. It is a few blocks from red and blue line stops. Very friendly and helpful hotel staff - superior to what one usually gets. Another distinguishing feature is the availability of food and bottled water - they don't nickel and dime you at Kinzie. Breakfast buffets are out on each floor so very convenient - and very well-stocked with food too. Cookies and water are out in the evening. Great place to stay when you'll be on the go and won't have time to fool with details like that. Also, the rooms are larger than what I usually get in Chicago so for a long convention where you live there 5-6 days that makes a big difference too,"
"The Kinzie is great boutique hotel in a great neighborhood in the River North Area. It is in walking distance of everything. The rooms have all be remodeled and are very nice. The included buffet breakfast is great and so is the cocktail reception every night. Also, the wifi is included in the room price. And the staff is great and they are all very helpful. I highly recommend this hotel for your next stay in Chicago.

"Happily, this hotel is still great under the new name. Breakfast near the elevators every morning and there is a tray in your room so you can easily carry your selections back to your room. Bagels actually were decent all thing considered. They don't have a front desk per se, but a more casual type of area with desks and chairs to check-in. Every one is super friendly and the location is great. It across from Harry Carrys, around the corner from house of Blues and a short walk to Portillos, hard rock and Pizza due for those have to have a deep dish pie and an Italian beef sandwich on every visit to Chicago as I do."
"This was a trip to celebrate an anniversary and the hotel was a great choice.Location was perfect, walkable to and from shops and sights.The room was uber modern in a comfortable way, slept really well and no noise.The staff are trained to be professional but to be nice too takes it to another level. Breakfast on each floor is a great idea if you need to be somewhere.Enjoyed the weekend in Chicago, wonderful stay at the Kinzie."
"We stayed at the Kinzie hotel for 4 nights just prior to Memorial Day. The hotel is in a great central location; walking distance to the SkyDeck, Millennium Park etc. They offer a basic breakfast on every floor in the morning, self serve, grab and go type of foods like cereal, bagels, hard boiled eggs, coffee, tea. They also offer a cocktail event in the evenings. The staff was very accommodating and friendly."
"We stayed here last week while my husband had a meeting at the Merchandise Mart. The location was good for us, close to his meeting, shopping and many dining choices. We had plans for other restaurants already but there are many options in the area. The price was reasonable for the area. The room was clean and bed comfortable. The bathroom toiletries were very nice. It is great to have free wi-fi available. The staff were very nice, always greeting you and providing any information you might need. The breakfast is served out by the elevators so you don't have to go to a dining room. but you then have to eat in your room, that can be good or bad, not sure if I like it. The choices were fine, heavy on bakery and grain items, my husband enjoyed the hard boiled eggs. They had yogurt available. They have a happy hour available which I did check out. They even gave you coins for redeeming alcohol drinks and had a nice assortment of snacks. It was located on the 6th floor in a room with a bar and tables. It was a nice touch but we had other plans. The valet service seemed to take a long time, especially when we were checking out on a Saturday morning. I would look at staying here again due to price and location."
"Upon arrival, we passed the car keys to the valet (daily fee) and did not need see the car the entire weekend. We were in town to visit area Universities, find a prom dress, and meet up with friends. The Kinzie met all the requirements: walkability to ""power shopping"", plenty of delicious restaurants/ bars close by, and clean modern rooms with trendy decor. After comparing several websites, calling the Hotel direct gave the best weekend rate, so do your homework. The breakfast (free) on the run is a light buffet bar on each floor. Items such as yogurt, cereal, and bagels. There is also a Managers reception (free) in the evening which was fun for the adults before a night on the town, as we snacked on light appetizers and drinks. The view from our room was another building, which didn't really matter to us. My teens loved the visit."

"We've stayed at this location may times over the years when known as the Amalfi and have always enjoyed the wonderful service, amenities and perfect location. This was our first visit since the transition to the Kinzie brand and can happily report there is certainly no falloff in quality! Spotless, well decorated rooms; complementary evening reception with hors d'oeuvres and beverages; convenient breakfast on each floor; great wifi reception; and friendly, helpful staff make this a place we'll return to for all our Chicago visits."
"We have stayed at this establishment several times, under the Amalfi banner and now the Kinzie name, and service, amenities, comfort and particularly staff are all exceptional regardless of the title. Our visits to Chicago have included stays at numerous Chicago hotels and none can quite compare to the way the Kinzie cares for their guests. We have decided this is the onlly place we will frequent going forward. The location in River North is perfect for restaurants, the Mag Mile and the theater district.Breakfast availability on each floor is highly thoughtful and wonderfully convenient. The variety of choices is greatly appreciated along with the attention to cleanliness and re-stocking of items throughout the morning.The complimentery hors d' oeuvres and cocktails every evening are an amazing perk and, while we are not overly indulgent drinkers ourselves, our friends are exceptionally impressed and we do take advantage of this thoughtful reception.The new makeover is amazing! The rooms have always been good sized and comfortable but we love what the local designers have done with them! The beds are sooo comfortable we didn't want to leave, the bathrooms well designed with dual shower heads and the H2O products very nice. the clean, bright new look is fantastic. We were lucky enough to get our favorite corner room so had plenty of space to spread out in.But the very best thing about the Kinzie is it's people! No one, and I mean no one, takes care of you like Kinzie people! We cannot understand why anyone would want to stay anywhere but here with a staff like the Kinzie has. Melissa, Meg, Jose, Julian, all of the Bellman...and everyone else greets you like family. You are remembered and welcomed every time you return. They will do everything they can...and they do...to make certain your stay is as perfect as possible. Everyone has a most wonderfully sincere attitude that you just do not find anywhere else. We had slipped away for the weekend to be married and these people created, without our asking, a time that we will never forget. But, believe me, you don't have to be celebrating anything special to be treated this way. Every time we've been there we have received the same treatment. Lest you think there are no flaws, of course there have been, but the truth is (and we have been in the hospitality business ourselves so we know this is not always the case) they have been rectified so quickly that they are not worth mentioning. The bottom line is this; the Kinzie is a place we highly, highly recommend....not only on Trip Advisor but also to our friends and family. We sincerely hope you enjoy it as much as we do."
This hotel used to be the Amalfi Hotel but recently completed an $85 million renovation and had a grand opening a few weeks prior according to the staff. It is a great boutique hotel close to shopping with free wifi and breakfast on each floor. There's also a complimentary reception each night (though it does have a limited beer menu). I recommend staying above the 2nd floor though to get away from the street noise at night from the bars nearby.
"I had the opportunity to stay at the Kinzie and had one of the newly renovated rooms - it was fabulous! I have stayed there many times in the past, and have always been impressed with the attention to detail and friendliness of the front desk staff and the bellmen. The warm friendly welcome and attentiveness hasn't changed - I really like the new upgraded rooms!The best of the past has been retained and and they've added great value as well - I highly recommend the property! Too many restaurants within an easy walk to mention including Harry Carays right across the street. Perfect location, and an amazing value!!"
"Spent 3 days and all were great. The staff is friendly and helpful and can answer any question you have. The rooms are very nice, just upgraded and a nice size. The hotel is set within walking distance to Mag Mile, the theather district and oh so many restaruants, Harry Careys is across the street and a supurb steak house is 2 doors down. They give you a contential breakfast that is worth the room price alone. They have a managers party each night with free drinks and what they call light snacks, actually it's more like a meal. The drinks are great and all top shelf. I will return. It is well worth the price. I would suggest that you pop the few dollars and get a corner room.


Room Tip: Spend the extra for a corner room, they are very large.

"Stayed here from the 7th to 9th April 2014 with two children, 7 & 11. We were able to take advantage of the hotel's reopening deal, which gave a good discount off the standard room rate. The room was very nicely finished and freshly decorated and the beds and bedding were very clean. There was good space and a little sofa under the front window. The blinds were good and we were able to sleep very well.We were given tokens for the early evening welcome drinks and snacks in the bar and the kids drinks were free.We could have parked our car locally for about $30 per night, but paid the extra for valet service, about $56 per night! but they would bring it back and re-park when needed. Parking at attractions was about $20 per day, so used the buses to the museum campus area.Could not fault the breakfast, served by the elevators on each floor and you grabbed what you wanted and returned to your room. Good selection of cereals and Danish pastries. Coffee was very good and were able to grab a coffee to go before we left to explore the city.Hotel was just a block from the river, with Wacker Drive on the other side and a couple of blocks from Michigan Avenue and the Magnificent Mile for the shopping, so could not be faulted.Very please and would stay there again in a flash if in Chicago again."
"I planned a short getaway and came across Hotel Kinzie (formally the Almafi) wanted to have some couple time with BF and make some new memories sightseeing in Chi town. This was a bit of a splurge in price but the amenities e.g. Daily breakfast, yummy cookies from a local bakery and a decent signature cocktail reception made it all worthwhile. Initially I was drawn in by the discounted rate advertised as the ""grand reopening"". A lovely stay in chic surroundings with polite staff all the way around. Cheers to Hotel Kinzie, a boutique hotel I look forward to revisiting."
"Great location, clean, modern rooms, kids thought it was fancy. Great price with Travelzoo. Small snacks and one alcoholic drink is included at the evening reception, (non alcoholic free) even for kids, but not really kid-friendly. More of a lounge atmosphere. great continental breakfast on your room floor. Juices, cereal, fruit, yogurt... Makes it an even better value!! Please check...

"We treated ourselves to an outing in Chicago and were extremely pleased with the accommodations and service at the Amalfi. The first night, our room was on an alley and we were awakened around 4 a.m. with the trash trucks doing their thing. When I asked the woman at the front desk if that occurred every night, she immediately said we will move you to another room and when we came back to the hotel, we were greeted by name by our concierge and told of our new room number. The concierge was also very helpful in suggesting eating establishments. My wife and I like different ethnic foods, and the concierge would say, ""Let me think on that and I will call your room in just a few."" Then he would call, say reservations had been made, and when we came down into the lobby, he gave us a card good for free drinks or desserts. And his suggestions were spot on. Don't forget about the manager's reception every evening with top shelf liquors and excellent hoes-deourves. All in all, I would say the Amalfi, while a little pricy, is well worth the pampering."
"We stayed at the Amalfi Hotel over Thanksgiving break. It was a very short walk to the holiday parade which was convenient. It was also close to most of the good shopping, being only a 15 minute walk from Michigan Ave and the Water Tower Place. The rooms were a bit small but had great furniture. Our view was excellent, be sure to ask for a city view upon check in. The best part of our stay was the daily free happy hour from 5-8 consisting of an open bar and appetizers. Talk about fun! The hotel staff were very generous about giving out drink tickets. We had a blast at this hotel, I would definitely stay here again!


Room Tip: Corner suites have some of the best views

"We will return to the Amalfi next visit to Chicago. As other reviewers have noted, the location is prime. Just a few blocks from The Loop (where we stayed last visit); we greatly appreciated a central-feeling location without the traffic noise. (Our first instinct is always to stay in a ""downtown"" to get the local feel; the Amalfi satisfied this preference, with the added bonus of less traffic & pedestrian congestion.) Impressive number of restaurants and bars in the area, with great variety to suit all tastes.Other noted pros: - Cocktail hour, which kicks up merriment (and some noise with the fun, so do not stay on the 6th floor if napping at 5:30 without earplugs is your thing). With complimentary drink vouchers upon arrival, we enjoyed a cocktail nightly, along with delicious, fresh hors d'ouevres (copious enough to substitute for a meal one evening). -- Staff was distinctly professional. Our two minor complaints were addressed immediately. (Upon returning home I recalled my irritation that the bathrobes had been scratchy. An email to the hotel later, we were given a generous refund of part of our stay -- a truly outstanding accommodation. I'm certain we would have been given new bathrobes if we had mentioned it at the time; it just didn't irk me until returning home and starting to write my TA review. A semi-functional iHome clock radio/mp3 station -- the power button was stuck -- was rectified while we were out.) The staff's restaurant recommendations were perfect; we ate at each of the three recommended places and each was spot-on; the staff had truly listened to what we were seeking. Housekeeping did not even knock when the ""Zzzz' sign was hung. When we finally did get out for the day, an afternoon tidy-up was effected no problem. And houskeeping was spotless.- Modern design with occasional flourishes; comfortable use of space.- Aveda products. Hotel toiletries do not usually provoke a reaction in me, but I was gratified the hotel uses relatively healthy and not-animal-tested (and yummy!) products.- King-sized bed was comfortable and a two kinds of pillows (for a generous five pillows total) came with.- Fitness room was larger and better stocked than most hotel gyms.Only noted cons:- The rooms in the back of the building face the back of the next block; on the sixth floor, we overlooked a parking lot and rooftops. Lower floors (fourth and below) presumably look into back windows. That being said, we enjoyed the Chicago-y high rise view beyond the rooftops. Kinzie Street along the front of the hotel is not particularly busy (ok, this from a Manhattanite) but the old view-versus-quiet conundrum definitely applies to the second, third, and fourth floors. We had NO noise problems (three days, three nights) from the alley that divides the two buildings.- Like most new American hotels, the windows do not open. The ventilation system was not ideal, and the room felt stuffy. Caveat: We did not try all the A/C settings. There may well have been a ""fan"" setting in addition to the ""heat"" and ""off"" settings that we did use. But if you are prone to feelings of discomfort in a stuffy room, it's worth checking in with the hotel about whether their ventilation system draws in outside air or recycles building or room air. It was just never very fresh. Also, in the wintertime consider bringing a travel humidifier. Other new American hotels have not bothered me like this did.All in all, a fun time on a couples trip. See you next time, Amalfi!

"It was my first visit to Chicago, and glad I picked the Amalfi. Location was great, near Magnificent Mile for shopping, and within 20min walk of major tourist places (Millennium Park, John Hancock tower, Navy Pier etc). Great places to eat close by, runs parallel to Hubbard St.Staff were extremely helpful, providing me with maps and tourist info.Complimentary breakfast served every floor, had to take back to room to eat, but nice touch. Nightly reception on 6th floor (between 5.30 to 7pm), given vouchers for 2 free drinks per night.My room was on 4th floor at back, view over street, relatively quiet. Room was OK in size, bed comfortable, temperature control was handy. Bathroom OK too, Aveda products were great. Kept very clean, though it wasn't cleaned until after 5pm on first day.Lobby is fairly small but comfortable.Would definitely recommend it, and will stay there again, great value though understand hotel is being renovated and renamed in March 2014 (Kinzie Hotel), so hope price doesn't rise too much."
"I escorted a group from Kansas City and could not have found a better location and property. The staff go well beyond the imaginable, the hotel is maintained in tip-top shape and the complimentary continental breakfast and evening cocktail party is such a bonus.I highly recommend this hotel for individual or group travel. The staff have all been trained to accommodate the guest first and ask questions second. Pricing is extremely fair and reasonable for a boutique hotel within walking distance of many Chicago standards.

"The location is absolutely perfect for visiting the town. Close to restaurants, pubs, metro station, departure for cruises on the river and just in front of the 'House of Blues'!We had a very nice room with a very confortable king-size bed, nice and clean bathroom completed with the very good Aveda products.Absolutely great the idea of the 'happy hour' everyday from six to eight, coming back from a busy visiting day and getting a break before heading out for dinner: friendly staff and delicious buffet.We also appreciated the breakfast at the floor: one can step out of the room in pijamas, grab a cup of coffee and feel at home...of course one can also seat in the lounge and enjoy a nice start of the day!Perfect hotel in Chicago!"
"For all the reasons I loved the hotel the first time around, the second time was even better. This time I was with my wife and we were extremely happy with our stay. The location is perfect and all of the amenities you would expect at a top notch hotel are here at the Amalfi.The staff, the concierge, the valets - all very helpful. The concierge helped me score Bears tickets.The convenience of the breakfast set up is great. But the best is still the nightly cocktail hours. When drinks are flowing in a packed room it makes for a good time and fun to mingle with other people.When in Chicago you must stay at the Amalfi."
"We had a great experience at Amalfi.PROS:Localization - close to metro stations, to Loop, to Michigan Avenue, to Chicago river... Very convenient. Lots of restaurants nearby.Room - good size. We spent 10 nights at Amalfi and had lots of luggage, and the room has enough space to accommodate everything. Quiet (our room faced the back of the hotel - although the view was so so, it was quiet). Bed is confortable, shower is great. Aveno products available.Breakfast - selfservice at a lobby- you can eat it at your room. Fruits (banana, orange and apple), breads, coffee, yogurt, eggs, cheese, pastries, milk, tea, cereals, juices (orange and cranberries) available. Suggestion: include honey sachets, hot milk and forks.The hotel offers complimentary drinks (alcoholic and non alcoholic) at night for the guests. Very friendly.We had an early checkout (noon) at no cost, and a late checkout at the cost of U$ 10,00 for each additional hour.We had at the Amalfi a great reception and the staff is very eager to meet your needs.CONS:Parking at the hotel is very expensive. We rented a car for one day and prefered to return it the same day. CONCLUSION:Would return, definetely!!


Room Tip: If you want a quiet room, choose one facing the back.

"Stayed in the Amalfi for the second time, the last trip was six years ago, we were happy then and six years on, delighted to have stayed there again.Its location is super, Michigan Avenue is a few minutes walk away and go across the bridge near the hotel you are on the Southside!!Checkin was stress free and the lady on the desk, could not have been more accommodating. A nice bonus staying here is that you get vouchers (tickets) for drinks each evening in the Ravello Lounge is on the 6th floor, we stayed on the 6th floor, so drinks were close any evening we were in!! We had a corner room and everything was great, from all the lovely toiletries, towels and bedding, the room was really comfortable, great for relaxing after long days wandering around Chicago.Breakfast is help yourself in the morning, on each floor near the lifts, being awake early due to jet lag, the 6.30 start was great, pastries, cereals, bagels, breads, fruit and drinks, didn't need much more.Across the road is Harry Carrays bar, great for sports and food, so location again brilliant.For value this is one of the best places I have stayed in. Would I go back...yes, no problem.There are loads of good places to eat close by, the Amalfi ticked all the boxes for me.

"This was our first visit to Chicago. Staff at the Amalfi made it that much more enjoyable. They were very helpful with our sightseeing arrangements, rooms were clean, breakfast got us off to a good start and their friendliness made our stay a good experience. We all thought this hotel gave us good value at this price point. It's close to many great restaurants, shopping the magnificient mile and the Navy Pier. Our only negative was a noisy wedding party in the next room which kept us up for 2 nights. Thought that the hotel should monitor each floor for disruptions throughout the night. Yes, we should have called the front desk as they assured us they would've responded."
"The Amalfi lived up to all the hype. It was my adult daughters' birthday and Magan made sure we had a great room on the 6th floor with a lovely treat delivered to our room shortly after arrival. Very comfortable bed and pillows and loads of fluffy towels. Loved the plush robes that allowed us to go out to the elevator area in the morning to pick up a substantial continental breakfast and take it back to our room. The Ravello lounge with a free drink and nibbles was a nice touch. All the staff was pleasant and helpful but a special shout out to Magan and Julian who always made me laugh. Would definitely return to this hotel. We were able to walk to most places.


Room Tip: Ask for 6th floor facing street!

"We stayed there two nights. The room was spacious, quiet and comfortable. It was super clean for you clean freaks out there. The morning breakfast was pretty decent. The lobby is very small, and has a sit down desk check in which was a nice touch. The hotel staff was helpfull on directing us to restaurants and getting around. All in al this is a great value considering its great location. The best thing I can say is that its location makes it convienient, but out of the insane intensity of the Navy pier and Michagan avenue chaos. It was a great place to stay."
"I stayed at the Amalfi in September of 2013 and was blown away! This hotel is amazing - they've thought of every detail to make the guest experience exceptional. When you check-in, you're given a ticket for a complimentary cocktail at their nightly reception, which I welcomed after a long day of traveling and being in meetings. Every morning each floor has an extensive breakfast display, with a variety of cereals, bagels, muffins, coffee, tea, etc. I was expecting a ""standard"" continental breakfast display, this was above and beyond. It was easy to grab something as I was on my way to more meetings - again, very much appreciated. The hotel itself was modern, clean, well-maintained - absolutely no complaints. My room and bathroom were clean, the bed was very comfy. The only thing is that the hotel is only 6 floors, so if you're looking for a city view, you probably won't get it. The location was convenient, the doorman was even able to get us a cab quickly during the height of rush hour! All other staff were friendly and helpful too.I'd highly recommend this hotel to anyone traveling to Chicago and look forward to staying there again."
"Picked this place after reading others reviews and we are glad we did. Their weekend rate was quite reasonable considering its great location. We were able to walk to dinner and to the theatre. Parking of course was extra and not cheap but this is Chicago. The room was nice, very comfortable king size bed with luxurious linens. We stopped for the free cocktail and appetizers before heading out and were really surprised at how nice this was. Breakfast was also a nice added touch with quite a selection and being on each floor made it easy to run out for another cup of coffee or danish. Used the exercise room only because it was raining and found it to be adequate. Will definitely return!"
"We stayed at the Amalfi Hotel in September. I was there to attend a conference and had my husband join me for the weekend to shop and enjoy Chicago before it began. I choice this hotel because it was a much better value than the hotel where the conference was being held. I was really glad that I did. Very welcoming staff, cocktail hour with appetizers and a free drink ticket every night, and a breakfast buffet on every floor in the morning. What is not to like? The room was on the small side but very clean and well appointed with robes, coffee maker and a tray for bringing breakfast items back to your room in the morning. The location is great as well. It is a block from the river and walking distance to all the normal tourist sites and highly rated restaurants. Great stay and value."
"Booked a suite on the 6th floor; the Hotel has business offices above the 6th floor. They offer valet parking but its pricey (don't exactly remember how much) but there are plenty of garages near by. The area is walking distance to the river walk, lake, Grant Park, and endless views of architectural titans looming over the river and beyond. The neighborhood is safe and fun for the young and up. Chops, dry aged steaks and excellent wine and service is found in the immediate and nearby areas, however be prepared to pay $$$. Ah the hotel, all the staff we met were friendly, always smiling, gracious, and ready to take care of their guests. The hotel is quaint and not overwhelming like large scale hotels. Our suite was clean, roomy, quiet, with nice views of the downtown skyline. The bed was very comfortable, plush, and we slept quite well. We had a few friends stay over one night at which time we were provided with a fold-out bed which was comfortable enough. The evening hosted cocktail service offers 2 free drinks per guest, ranging from domestic and imported wines, beers, and cocktails-spirits. Its a sociable event and not too crowded. The complimentary continental breakfast offered us fresh fruits, cereals, coffee, teas, pastries, hard boiled eggs, yogurt and more. The Amalfi Hotel is not a high-end hotel, but we felt we got more value for our money while maintaining a solid notch above the rest. We would definitely stay again, Thank You Amalfi!"
"Breakfast every morning, served on every floor in the elevator lobby 'buffet style'. We found it was plenty to get us going ... and loved that you can take the food to your room.Then, in the evening, a reception including charcuterie, cheese, breads AND a free cocktail or beer or wine. A nice appetizer before dinner on the town.Luxury, boutique hotel. Very well maintained. Love the check-in at a desk instead of standing at a counter. All the staff are super-friendly and helpful.And you can walk to all of the major attractions/buildings/restaurants, or hop on transit.We bought a package that included valet parking with in/out privileges ... stayed five nights and didn't use the car once.Fabulous. Highly recommended!

"We looked around a lot for hotels in Chicago before booking this one and we made the right choice for sure. This was the first time my wife had even been to Chicago and I wanted the hotel to be upper level as it would be her first contact with the city. The Amalfi did not disappoint at all. We let them know we were coming for our (very) belated honeymoon (11 years later) and the first thing that greeted us was champagne and chocolate dipped strawberries in the room. Maybe even better than that though was the wonderful personalized card we got. It was an outstanding first impression. The room was clean, the sheets were soft, the bed was comfortable and our room location was ideal. We were on the 5th floor in 528 and right outside the window was a view of Harry Caray's restaurant which as a Cubs fan made me smile. The room was a great size and was not cramped or crowded at all. My sister stayed on the other side of the hotel and her room was great as well. The staff could not have been any better. From the front desk to the cleaning crew everyone was friendly and willing to help. Major shout out to everyone there. The location was great. We were able to walk to so many places. Of course we like walking so that may not be for everyone. For the further locations like Wrigley Field and the Museum of Science and Industry it is a short walk to the public transportation system that will get you anywhere. We got free drink certificates for the bar on the 6th floor as well and wish we would have had time to use more of them. Chicago has a tendency to make you lose track of time though and we never seemed to be at the hotel during the time we could use them unfortunately. It is a nice touch though, and the snacks they put out were delicious. The only drawback I can see for some people is there isn't a pool or bar that is open late. But for us this was a non-issue as we were there to enjoy the city and didn't have to pay for amenities we were not going to use. Because of this the price was even better than you would expect considering what you get and we are already planning, and looking forward to staying there again on our next trip to the Windy City. Hopefully sooner than later!

"My wife and I have stayed here several times most recently over Labor Day weekend...this is not a large chain hotel but rather an European style boutique hotel...rooms are clean, decent size and the bathroom we've always had is quite large with ample space on the lavatory for yoru personal items...the continental breakfast on each floor offers 'peeled' fruits, cold cereal, rolls, doughnuts, toast, yogurt...not extensive but certainly enough...not mainly hotels in this area offer a 'comp' breakfast...a 'comp' Happy Hour each evening in a small 6th floor lounge provides one complimentary drink and 'munchies'...previously the drinks were endless but this has changed so either the hotel is doing so well financially it no longer has to entice with unlimited drinks or is not doing well and can no longer afford endless alcohol..who knows??...nonetheless it's still a nice perk!...the location is excellent in the River North area just two blocks from Michigan Avenue and Mag Mile shopping...a vareity of restaurants are just steps from the front door...if you go down the street a few blocks to the Sterling parking garage on the corner of Kinzie and Clark the price is much cheaper than hotel valet...the staff is friendly, check in is a breeze and elevator service is prompt compared to larger hotels...all in all, we've never had a bad experience so highly recommend this hotel property!

"My son, friend, and her daughter all stayed at the Amalfi hotel for four days in mid August. The hotel was clean, close to everything, and the staff was excellent. Yes, some of the furniture in the lobby had very small rips in the leather (or vinyl?), but it was all spotless! We were met with smiles, and constant offers of assistance. I had just broken my foot, and was in a wheelchair for most of the trip. The Amalfi staff were very accomodating, and extremely helpful when it came to arranging cab service with the extra space for my chair. We arrived too early to check our bags into our room, and upon leaving we also had nowhere to put our bags while we hit a few last minute tourist attractions. The hotel graciously held all 7 of our bags (I did mention that three of us were ladies, right? Hence the 7 bags for 4 days...) while we completed our trip. Breakfast on the floor was such a plus, and even though the variety was small, it was certainly enough to satisfy everyone! Cocktail hour was fantastic, and we met folks from France, New Orleans, Kentucky, and a few other places. The bar room is a bit small, but really it just forced us to talk to strangers, and it made the trip that much more interesting. I had been corresponding with one of the staff at the hotel previous to our arrival, and she helped to make our trip ten times better. A very big thank you to Ms. Bertetto - you deserve a pat on the back from the management there - before I even arrived I knew I had found my favourite place to stay!!! I've travelled often, stayed at Four Seasons, Fairmonts, and many other places. I believe the Amalfi beats them all with their uniqueness, proximity to attractions, and the dynamics of the staff.. The only complaint I have is one. After we left on the first day we had slept there to explore, we came back to a room that had barely been touched. I was a little surprised by that. BUT it was only once, and the room was kept neat and tidy for the next three days. KAC from Sarnia, Ontario"
"We booked the hotel for 7 nights through Hotwire secret hot rate and specified we were a family with a teenager. Apparently, we were booked for a King bed. The hotel wanted to charge us additional $ to switch to two queens. Most hotels we have booked through Expedia and Hotwire (and even priceline) have always accommodated a request for two doubles but the Amalfi charges extra for it's two queen beds, even though it is the same size room as it's King bed room. However, after much wrangling with the hotel management based on just the principle that we had specified we would be three people in all and a teenager can't be expected to share a bed with parents - they moved us a two queens beds after the first night at no extra charge. Even so, we were paying almost $190 per night after taxes and fees.The management did send us a letter of apology and complimentary cookies & drink the second night.The hotel itself is highly recommended. The beds are very comfortable and room was clean. The complimentary breakfast is adequate to get you started and convenient since it's on each floor. The hotel also has complimentary Wi-fi. We did not use the parking so cannot comment on that. The location could not be better - we walked to quite a few sights and connections to most EL lines is just few blocks from hotel. There are also many restaurants nearby. Despite the unpleasantness with the bed type and the slight tension due to that (not a great feeling for a vacation), I would recommend this hotel based on the location and room and the fact the hotel did resolve our request satisfactorily at our insistence. Though I would ensure that the room is booked via a service that allows to specify the bed type since the rates are different.


Room Tip: Ask for a room away from alleys or on a top floor. Also, if bed type is important, book from a servi...

"We have just returned home from Chicago. We stayed at the Amalfi Hotel from August 20 to August 24. The location was perfect for us. We had booked the Hop on-Hop off bus. The spots for pick up were close to the hotel. The hotel is convenient to restaurants and the downtown area. Upon arriving at the Amalfi the staff were very friendly and helpful. Our friends had arrived the day before and the staff made sure we were in the same floor as them. Each day we returned after seeing the sites, we were always greeted by all staff in the front foyer with a smile and ""how was your day"".A breakfast was provided every morning. Just by the elevator on each floor there were bagels, muffins, cereal, juice, coffee, tea and milk. Breakfast was to be eaten in the comfort of your room. Each evening from 6:00 to 8:00 pm on the sixth floor in a ""lounge room"" there were hors d'ouvers and drinks offered at no expense to the guests. Complimentary drink tickets were given upon arrival. It was a nice way to relax for awhile before going out again for the evening.Wake up calls, assistance and information were all given in a very friendly manner. We would definitely recommend this hotel to family and friends.A most enjoyable stay."
"I booked directly on the Amalfi website for a two night stay in a deluxe King nonsmoking room for two adults and a 10 year old. The cost was $429 before taxes. I asked for a 5th or 6th floor room facing the city because I had read the reviews. The reservation supervisor assured us 8 days before our trip that the desk staff makes their very best effort to meet such requests. We were given a room (room 212) on the second floor. Our room was so small they could not fit in a roller bed for our daughter. They offered us a room that could take a roller bed for $25 per night extra; however this room was also on the second floor and would have us facing a brick wall across an alley where homeless people meet (read other reviews). We decided not to accept this ""upgrade"". At that point our consolation was that at least the room was not as noisy as described in other reviews, but that was before the night. The night noises from the street were very loud and kept our daughter awake most of the night. It also did not help that the room was constantly cold and the air conditioning control unit was ineffective. The room carpet and bathroom tiles are of a color designed not to show dirt, however along with the room window, they were noticeably either dirty, stained or grimy. The bathroom ceiling clearly needs repair.The furniture in the room were flimsy and chipped. The furniture in the public areas on the second and fifth floor (where the gym is) are also chipped. The TV is not high definition and is appropriately sized for such a small room.A faint putrid smell during the free breakfast should have warned me not to go early morning jostling for the rancid eggs, which eventually left me with an upset stomach. It was not all bad though, there was great weather and we visited nice restaurants and many attractions. This hotel is within walking distance to many Chicago attractions. Wifi was good and and the gym was nice (at night). In summary I did not have to apologize too much to my wife and daughter for making such a poor choice of an hotel as the other aspects of the trip covered up.


Room Tip: Choose another hotel

"We recently booked this hotel through Hotwire and got a very good price. I hadn't checked the hotel out before as it was always a bit above our budget. So I was pleasantly surprised when I booked this and read all the fabulous reviews. My daughter picked Chicago as our annual road trip so we drove into the heart of the city and it was very easy to get to the hotel. When pulling up for the valet parking pull up in front of the front doors as there is also a private valet service just at the corner and this is not part of the hotel. Check in was fabulous and they unloaded our car and took our bags up to our room. The rooms are not overly large but with so much to see and do in the city there is little time to spend n the room. We were lucky enough to be on the 6th floor, just beside the elevator, which you could not hear once inside your room. The hospitality room where they serve happy hour was just down the hall and was a fabulous treat. Breakfast is put out every morning just outside the elevators and we could slip out every morning in our pj's and robes to help ourselves. The selection of food was fantastic and was more then enough! The hotel is in just the right location and made it very easy to get to all the sites and eateries. I highly recommend a restaurant not too far from the hotel called Centro, it was fabulous! they serve homestyle so order a couple of dishes and share them. We also had stuffed pizza at Giordanis and it was delicious. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at the hotel and loved the city of Chicago."
"If you looks for a no-frills/no drills hotel in a good central location at a good price, Amalfi is your pick. Check-in and -out is efficient and fast (maybe a given in USA bu I live in China...and for you who travel to China, you know what I mean..)Rooms are ""just right"", clean (but this is a given for me in USA), bathroom is relatively large when compared to the room and amenities are good quality (Aveda). I loved the choice of sweets and nuts offered in the room. The breakfast is quite peculiar as it is self-service by the elevator at each floor, with a good choice of muffins, bakery, cereals, yogurts etcthe gym is small but well equipped.The bar offers complimentary drinks during happy hours...very crowded..so I guess people like it."
"The rooms are very clean and well maintained. The hotel is close to everything downtown. The hotel is muchsmaller than many I have stayed in which was actually very nice. The complimentary breakfast served on every floor by the elevator, is one of the best breakfasts I have had in a hotel. The snacks served in the evening in the lounge are nice. The doorman was VERY helpful with directions and information.I would certainly stay here on a return trip to Chicago."
"The Amalfi Hotel sits quietly caddy corner from Harry Carey's Steakhouse on W. Kinzie. Walking distance of so much art and galleries and museums, the miracle mile surely encompasses all you will need in shopping, dining, wining and other Windy City must dos, like the Blues Club around the corner next to Hotel Sax.The breakfast buffet is served each morning at the elevator lobby...ingenious set up when you pad down the hall in your luscious house robe at 9am. Free cocktail coupons (I got 3 for myself) are for your nightly happy hour on the penthouse (6th floor). And the nosh with those cocktails is A superb.In room massage arranged for next morning pre check out, in and out priveleges for my car while in town all add up to a great pick, a new fave of mine."
"Lets start with the pros:- very helpfull staff.- good location.- well sized rooms- free wifi- enjoyed the nightly cocktail session with a couple of free drinks each night...pretty good quality cocktails too!- enough free breakfast to het you started.But one big negative. We booked a king size corner room which at face value was great, until we decided to sleep. The room we had for the first night was next to a building where the industrial strenght aircon. vent blasted at a loud noise all night. In addition, being a corner room there are copious windows and the way the curtains are set up, you just cant keep the sunlight out. Bottom line was that notwithstanding the size and comfort of the bed, we were awake at 6:30am after a very ordinaty nights sleep. We requested a room change the next day which was accommodated, but we still had the same light problems, with more sleep noise. So whilst this hotel ticks a lot of boxes, bottom line is that if you dont get a good nights sleep, this devalues the overall experience. So you just need to be carefull the type of room you book.


Room Tip: Dont pay extra for the king bed corner rooms!!

"Perfect location if you want to stay in downtown Chicago. We walked to Navy Pier, The Willis Tower (formerly The Sears Tower) to go the the Skydeck, the Art Institute and other nearby places. The Field Museum was a short cab ride away. Plenty of good restaurants nearby.The hotel put out a nice breakfast on every floor every morning and had a cocktail party each night. I would definitely stay there again."
"I looked at a lot of hotels before going to Chicago and I'm really happy I chose the Amalfi. The pros: friendly and helpful staff, nice quiet room (with a big bathroom and, if I craned my neck, a view of the Tribune Tower), good continental breakfast on every floor (included), really nice Italian antipasto buffet and 2 free cocktails per person nightly (included), free WiFi and a GREAT location. You're close to lots of restaurants and the Magnificent Mile and you're right at the foot of the State Street Bridge to reach all the sights in the Loop (architecture tours, museums, parks). The cons: Can't think of any!"
"Great base from which to visit Chicago, the hotel is very nice and clean. The breakfast consists of several buffet tables prepared on each floor so that you can just get out of bed grab something and go back, you can also visit several floors for variety. Overall a very good experience. Also had very helpfull staff, our luggage arrived late from the airport & the receptionist team could not have been more helpfull"
This place is great. Front desk staff VERY friendly and accommodating. theey ahve a continental breakfast each morning on every floor. They have a hospitality bar with free drink coupons from 5 - 8. The rooms are spacious and immaculate.I really like the Amalfi...it's WAY better than the Hyatt on Wacker. GREAT Popular bar on the corner. I've stayed here before and was very happy they have vacancies. Great location too. Not sure what else to say other than...they just get everything right!
"My Girlfriend and I had a couple days off and wanted to take a trip to the city and after shopping around by price and quality I ended up booking a last minute trip to Amalfi. I had never stayed or even heard of the brand but took a chance. Upon arriving the thing that stood our the most was the Fedora hats that the male staff wore, It suited the decor and feel of Amalfi perfectly and was something that could be cheesy if not done right but I loved them. The lobby was very modern and made great use of the space, check in was extremely easy and very personal. Our ""Experience Designer"" also had great suggestions for dinner. The only part i found off was how they just kind of thrust 2 bottles of water at you saying they are complimentary etc. I declined them and went up to the room where they had more water for 5$ a bottle. I would be nicer if there were 2 bottles in the room .The Room was very nice, modern, well kept. The bed was extremely comfortable, Cd's were provided in the room for light music and Dvd rentals were complimentary if we were just looking to relax. The directory was also very helpful to learn a bit about what's in the area. The 2 things i feel that could be improved on is the A/C was alright but it only went down to i think 70 and the room could have used a walk in shower more than the shower/tub.Breakfast and Cocktails were included as well, both tastefully done and relaxing. Breakfast is set up on each floor as a help yourself via the tray in the room, a very light healthy breakfast or start to the day. The cocktails and appetizers in their lounge is great for socializing and for the winding down at the end up of the day. Overall I really enjoyed my stay and will probably be back, next time I may book a suite and see how that is."
"I recently spent a long weekend at the Amalfi with my daughter for a special occasion. The lovely and incredibly convenient breakfast on your own floor each morning, the excellent 3 hour cocktail reception each day, free wifi and free local calls in a charming, extremely well situated hotel - makes this hotel hard to beat. Service is exceptional (aside from very friendly and helpful front staff, we came back to our room the first night to find a beautiful bottle of wine and two glasses awaiting us for a special birthday - in addition, a key left behind resulted in numerous calls from Erika from Customer Service who helped to retrieve it and who was a great pleasure to deal with). We did get a very good rate from Travelzoo ($139/night) but as long as this hotel continues to provide reasonable rates - this will be our ""go to"" hotel for our trips to Chicago. We loved it, have recommended it to others, and look forward to returning to the great city of Chicago and to this fabulous hotel. There's a reason the Amalfi receives so many good reviews - they are very well deserved.

"I had a very nice (if short) stay at the Amalfi Hotel on a recent spring Saturday. My dog was with me and he was greeted with enthusiasm by the staff. All pet-friendly rooms are on the 2nd floor (6 floors total) and there is a $25 cleaning fee for pets (per stay, not per night). The valet service was excellent ($49.99 overnight). I enjoyed the complimentary happy hour, which was pleasantly packed. I met travelers from all over the world. The hotel, at least on this particular weekend, seemed to attract a European crowd. The room itself was spacious and comfortable. The continental breakfast was above average and just down the hall. Truly a pleasant stay. I will be back--the only hotel I enjoyed as much in this neighborhood is the Hotel Sax."
"Stayed here three nights for a conference.The good: location, location, location. Great spot on Michigan Avenue, close to the river and the loop. Starbucks downstairs and Whole Foods two blocks away! The okay: room was fine, slightly tight and crowded. Bed sloped to one side.The bad: - Air conditioner was seriously noisy even on low. The only way to make it better was to turn it off. - Room was not clean enough. Dust buildup in corners. I could see a pen and spare change in between the bed and nightstand along with the dust.- For the three days that I came and went, going past the front desk, I was not once asked how my stay was going or even got a hello."
"Nothing but regret since choosing this location. There is a charge for almost everything. Wifi $18, Gym $12, Bottled water and peanuts in your room $10 (if you remove the items for longer than 30 seconds) and you will ask yourself one question once you arrive here, was the money you spent worth the value you thought you were going to receive? No. This is night one of our stay here and I have complete buyers remorse!"
"We went to Chicago for a quick get-away to celebrate our anniversary. The Intercontinental was not our first choice - the hotel we've used in the past has changed ownership. As a side note, IHG Reservations was very helpful in resolving the issues I had making the reservation. Now back to the hotel. Firstly, this is a big hotel and the prices are about what you'd expect from a property located in absolutely ""prime real estate"" in Chicago. However, check in, even at 10:45 AM, was friendly and efficient. I was informed our room was unfortunately.not ready, but we were directed to the bell stand to check our luggage and that I would receive a text message when it was ready. (Note: I never did receive a text.) The elevators are initially confusing - one set serves half the floors & the other set serves the rest. Fortunately, during high usage times there is a person standing by to assist guests find the right elevator bank to use. The room was spacious and clean. The bed was comfortable and the pillows were to our liking. The room had darkening shades which worked very well. Overall, the room was nicely appointed and comfortable. The hotel was hosting at least one large conference but the halls were quiet, and housekeeping was efficient. Hotel staff - front desk, bell, restaurant, concierge - were all courteous, efficient, knowledgable, and friendly. The hotel's location is excellent - close to restaurants, shopping, and an easy cab ride to all museums. Would I stay here again? Yes, but if all you want is clean and safe, there are other hotels in Chicago, although not as conveniently located."
"There is nothing to recommend this hotel. Fair rooms, amenities and the lobby/bar is an absolute zoo at night. You can easily do better for the money. Fit and finish-bathroom, sheets, towels, etc were middle brow at best. 500 Michigan Ave location is convenient to to the Loop business district but somehow the Intercontinental manages to be on a block without nice restaurants of shopping (there is a Mens Wearhouse across the street).

"This is a historical marvel, with it's really quite beautiful. Centrally located on Michigen Avenue, just a few blocks from Navy Pier, the water taxi stand, and the 360 Chicago (formerly known as the John Hancock Observatory). The rooms are nicely appointed, CLEAN, the beds are heaven, and the pool is a site to behold. Stayed one night with my daughter for a Spring Break Staycation. We did order room service for dinner, and the delivery was smooth, our food presented, and tip included in the charges (so much nicer than awkwardly handing over cash). Great sized portions, we just split it so we wouldn't waste/have leftovers. Comes from Michael Jordan's downstairs and it is very good.We ordered an in-room movie and were dismayed to find that when we had to leave with 1/2 the movie leftover, it was irretrievable without purchasing twice. This wasn't made clear with purchase, really. There was a confusing blurb about the subject, but we read it to mean it was available for 24 hours from purchase. Apparently it's available for ONE viewing per 24 hours. Ridiculous in my opinion for such a high-caliber hotel.Complimentary WiFi with IHG membership. Fast and readily available. Check in and concierge wonderful. Everyone is very very polite and helpful, without being intrusive. Umbrellas are available for rain, which I thought was a wonderful touch. We were always assisted in hailing cabs.Probably won't be back only because with that kind of cost, it's not really practical. There are equally well-placed hotels with more amenities. The showers in the ""spa/health club"" were being worked on so there was construction debris everywhere & there is only one small hot sauna room available. They should really expand the ""health club"" to be an ACTUAL full-service spa and then it would really be worth the hyped up price. Overall, worth a stay to enjoy the pool at least once- especially when it's cold and dreary outside."
"The title says it all! This was a great hotel in of the most perfect spots of the Magnificent Mile. I was able to take the Blue Line to the Red Line from the airport for a total cost of $5.00. I felt as though I was a Chicagoan and was only a little more than a block away from the hotel. I was able to walk through the mall and there was the Intercontinental Hotel. It is very close to the river, walk down the opposite direction and you have shopping for days. You have everything from Saks Fifth Avenue, Banana Republic, Cheesecake Factory, Nike town and many other stores you can enjoy. I enjoyed walking at night and felt very comfortable. The Chicago police officers were out in the streets so didn't have a fear at all. Also was able to find the Lamborghini and Rolls Royce shop so I was doing some major window shopping. I would recommend this hotel for the cool rooms with comfortable beds. I will include some photos from the room and the top floors for you to see. Enjoy."
"The Intercontinental in Chicago is an expensive hotel with lots of meeting space. The staff is about average-not rude, not particulary pleasant or welcoming. There is no lobby, which is annoying since there are many meetings in session at the same time and no place to sit down or network. Even though I hadn't requested it, I got an handicapped room that was very large-too large to see the TV from the bed. The room was spartan or minimalist and completely devoid of warmth. The handicapped walk-in shower seemed like a good idea until there was actually water running in and then regardless of how careful I was, water, got all over the bathroom floor. Using the water-saving toilet was also problematic-not once did the paper do down with the flush. There were several lamps in the room but since it was so large, it was difficult to see most of the room. The food sources in the hotel were not impressive-a steakhouse and a dirty overcrowded Starbucks. In general I found the hotel to be uncomfortable and not anyplace I wanted to do anything in beside sleep-if there had been another alternative, I would have switched hotels.My room was over $400/night, a price I would never pay for this hotel again. Definitely not worth the price. The location was great and it was easy to walk anywhere. In summary, this hotel is not nearly as nice as it thinks it is.


Green Features: Good practices, but not very workable. Also, replaced all towels even though they were not on the floor or in the tub. Did that for 3 days."
"Just back from 3 nights at this hotel in Chicago. The hotel is ideally placed for shopping and sightseeing, we were able to walk to many places, others were a short cab ride.Reception staff were friendly and welcoming and the concierge staff didn't put a foot wrong with directions or restaurant recommendations.The room was bigger than I expected and had all that we needed. Free wifi would have been a bonus but you only had to pop own to Starbucks and their service extended into the hotel lobby.Would very happily reccomend this hotel to anyone."
"My boyfriend and I stayed here one night on Halloween. You can't beat the Michigan Ave location.Perhaps we looked a bit disgruntled when checking in, because the front desk gave us a room with two beds when we had requested just one (whatever, more space to put me things). The room was one of the biggest I've seen in Chicago, and the bathroom was really nice as well. The bed was comfortable and everything seemed fairly clean.The hotel has a really nice fitness center, and my boyfriend loved the lap pool, which a staff member told us used to belong to a men's club. My only complaint is that when I ripped a hole in my shirt, and called down for a sewing kit/needle and thread, I was told to come down to reception. I went down and asked again for a sewing kit, and was told that housekeeping handles that sort of thing. The receptionist called a house keeper and told me it would only be a few moments. After a few minutes, someone from housekeeping came up, spoke with the receptionist, and then disappeared. After a few more minutes I asked if everything was going okay, and received a nod. About 20 minutes passed before I gave up and left. Not really a big deal, just kind of weird."
"This is renewed hotel where what matters the most is the location.Really close to all Chicago's must see and must do's. We only needed to take a taxi going from and to the airport, everywhere else we went walking.Nice small room, we were in the last floor and the water pressure was not good. The A/C was too loud so we turned it off, Chicago's weather it's better now so we could do that.Helpful staff but nothing exceptional.There is a Starbucks in the lobby but is crowded at morning and late afternoon. Just crossing Michigan Avenue there's a Walgreens where you can buy anything you need.The Michael Jordan restaurant is in the lobby too but there are so many really good restaurants in the area that we didn't go.Everything is good in this hotel, but the location is absolutely great!! Super recommended for short or long stays in Chicago."
"Hotel is nothing special. We expected a nice hotel in The InterContinental brand. Our room was fairly large but sparsely appointed. The bathroom had no counter space and very poor lighting. Lobby was cozy and the staff very friendly. Elevators were quick, never had to wait. We'd stay here again if the rate was a great deal but we wouldn't pay a premium rate. It's in a great location on Michigan Ave with great shopping and restaurants."
"We stayed here in March, mixing a business trip with a visit to the city.Hotel service was very good, staff efficient and helpful.We had a lovely room on 34th floor, great views.The location is perfect for seeing the city by bus, water or on foot.Breakfast was the usual hotel buffet but good selection of well prepared food.Had to pay for wifi and the fitness centre, although the pool was free.

"We enjoy staying at the Intercontinental Hotel - Chicago. Rooms are of better than average size, very clean, and comfortable. The location on Michigan Ave. is ideal for travel as this puts you in the heart of the downtown area. Eno - the wine bar - is excellent with the bartender very knowledgeable in a wide variety of wines from around the world.The cocktail bar is always crowded and noisy. Cocktail choice and their preparation needs improvement. Ingredients need to be measured for consistency.We tend not to eat in the restaurant so cannot comment - too many other from which restaurants to choose.Will stay there again."
"I have stayed in this hotel several times, the most recent being in December of 2014. My only complaint is that the front desk is usually overwhelmed with the check in process. We arrived after noon and had to leave our bags due to the room not being ready. When we returned at 5 pm, there was a huge line to check in and an even longer wait for our bags. Those are the negatives. The hotel is a beautiful hotel . The pool is an absolute must see! It is worth going to take a look. Our room was nicely furnished and clean. I have always been happy with the rooms we have had. The elevators are quick and the location is wonderful for the Chicago sights. I like that it is situated between the North Michigan Avenue shopping and still not that far from the State Street shopping and Theater district. However, we like to walk! The bell staff and concierge are always very helpful. There is a Starbucks, a Walgreens and even a McDonald's very close. Other very nice restaurants are plentiful. I usually use a third party booking company and am never disappointed if we stay at the Intercontinental."
"We were taking a girl's family trip (3 generations) to Chicago, and the location of the Intercontinental couldn't be beat! The beds were comfy, and the room was satisfactory, although our view was of some kind of tank and pipes coming out of it. But the customer service at the front desk left something to be desired. When we tried to check in (a prepaid reservation with a third party), they only had one room for us instead of two. When I showed the confirmation for two rooms, the lady said that she would have to talk to her manager. She came back 10-15 minutes later, and said that they would go ahead and give us the room. Then at checkout, I asked that a $19.95 internet charge be removed since we had not used it. She argued first that I had to have entered my room number and last name. I told her to check the last name, because it wasn't mine, since I didn't do it and didn't use their internet (except for in the business center where it cost .40/minute). Both times the matter was resolved, but with the attitude like I was trying to get away with something. No, ""Sorry for the misunderstanding. Let me take care of that for you."" The front desk could use a little more training in customer service."
"Was very pleased with how quickly we got checked in and to our room.We were early by a couple hours and just for fun I wanted to check to make sure they had our information and they did so we ended up getting our room three hours earlier than expected. We enjoyed the room. The bed was comfortable, had a decent view out from front of hotel on the 18th floor. The bathroom was nicely designed and and clean. I can't saying anything bad about the service we received for sure. I do think the carpet in the hallways was weird. The original color looks like it is blue, but there is sploshes of green coming from the walls everywhere. It may be the design of the floor, but it looks nasty and almost like mold. Perception is reality to most. We loved the stay and our trip and will definitely be back and will be staying at intercontinental Chicago because of the great service, great price, and great location to everything.

"Although I will say that the service at the Hotel Interncontinenal Chicago was exceptional - everything you would expect from a hotel of this class, the building itself is starting to show it's age.We had an interesting discussion about the new carpeting in the Historic Tower where we stayed; the carpeting appeared to be designed to look like old, worn cobblestones overgrown with moss, but it ended up looking like really badly worn and faded carpeting that badly needed to be replaced.I was so shocked by the appearance when I got out of the elevator I had to lean down and touch it to realize it wasn't actually faded and torn up. Fashion choice of carpeting not-withstanding, the building was still very clean and mostly in good repair. In the rooms, the windows, that used to open at one time, were clumsily bolted shut, meaning no fresh air. We also ran into a problem with the room HVAC system. It was at a very warm 72 degrees when we got there. We set it to 65 and 36 hours later when we left it had made it to 70 degrees. Since it was late and we were tired, we opted to sleep with other covers rather than spending an hour waiting for maintenance to tell us that it was working as expected :)The rate we paid for the room was around $145, which is reasonable for a Mag Mile hotel, but I admit that the hotel fell short of expectations. I had never been to a an Intercontinental property before and had a lot of respect for the brand. Now, I'm not sure that I would spend the extra to stay in another property because the one in Chicago fell short of expectations.To summarize: The room as very clean, the bed was comfortable, and the service was great, but the room was small, the heating/cooling didn't work properly, and some of the finishings and fittings in the room were rusty, tarnished, ill fitted, etc.

"The Hotel Intercontinental is a perfect location for exploring this vibrant city. Everything you could want is right outside the door. From world-class restaurants to historical buildings and the American Girl Doll Store, staying at the Intercontinental is wonderfully convenient. The rooms are very clean and the beds just heavenly...really nice after a long day of exploring Chicago! Our lovely concierge was spot on about the restaurants she recommended, we loved every place she suggested. A must see at the hotel is the beautiful architecture in the pool area. It's just gorgeous!!During our stay we unfortunately had our travel plans interrupted due to an incident at Midway Airport. We greatly appreciated the staff extending our stay in the room and giving us coupons for the on-site Starbucks. Actually, spending a few more days in Chicago wasn't all that bad."
"I just loved staying at this hotel. My room was so clean and nicely updated. The bed was very comfortable too. I was upgraded to a room with a view due to my status and it was incredible! My favorite part of this hotel is the junior olympic size lap pool from the 1920's. If you are a swimmer, bring your gear and be sure not to miss the opportunity. There is also a sauna which was very nice after swimming."
"Feb 16, 2015: Overall decent, however, we had a noisy HVAC heating unit, flat pillows, and smelly towels.Do suggest that hotel addresses HVAC issue, removing flat pillows and replacing with fluffy pillows, and PLEASE put some laundry booster when washing towels over and over again.For a luxury hotel, one would think that the giant pool area would have a Jacuzzi. But to our surprise, there wasn't. The pool area was beautiful and don't quite understand why you wouldn't have a hot tub for couples.

"Hotels is on Michigan Avenue, which is very centrally located. Close to shops, restaurants, underground. Check in was very crowded and there was a huge line ahead of us. Luckily my husband had a Gold card and had separate check in. Room was on the 21 floor. Nice but rather small and similar to all other IC hotel rooms. Beds were comfortable and clean. Bathroom was basic and could use a little paint. Rooms are well isolated. In my opinion this is more a business than leisure hotel. If I would get a good rate I would stay here again, otherwise I would go to another, more cozy hotel."
"Biz trip, only stayed few days. So available time for shopping is precious. Centralized location (Michigan Street), gives us plenty of time for evening shopping. From KIDS: Disney for kids wear, High end fashion lovers: Burberry flapship store - Must go in & experience ""Art of the Trench"", Macys, Bloomingdales, Victoria Secrets for friends & family gifts shopping. Convenient for food too. Level 1 - right side; starbucks (your breakfast choice!) and left side; Micheal Jordan Steakhouse (open daily, served both lunch, dinner - try MJ's Delmonico 16 oz! Crab cake and pork chop are good as well. And it even has night bar..). How convenient can it get! However for the slightly pricey room rate, since i didnt use much amenities, if i am for holiday, DoubleTree By Hilton (few blocks away) can be a good alternative."
"I stayed here because I got an excellent rate and as a Platinum Ambassador, I was able to check in early and was upgraded to a newly renovated suite. Bed was comfortable, hotel is quiet, and facilities are excellent. Location is about as good as it gets. For me, it is more or less next door to where I had business meetings, so that was a key decision making factor.The valet dropoff was easy enough, but pickup is less obvious because one has to go down to the garage, but it didn't detract from the overall experience. This will be my hotel of choice in Chicago from now on."
"In lieu of presents for our grandchildren on Christmas and birthdays, we take them for an overnight somewhere. We took two of our older grandkids, Jake and Maddie, 17 and 12 respectively, to Chicago over Martin Luther King Jr. holiday. One of the requirements of a hotel is a swimming pool. The Intercontinental Hotel's pool was a highlight but not as significant as the kids' first impression of hotel's lobby area. They were blown away. They especially like the giant video screen behind the reception desk. Starbucks was a hit as well. Our suite was the extreme whipped cream on the sundae! They absolutely loved it. We arrived on Sunday and checked out on Monday. We dropped our bags off and went out for the afternoon. When we came back, the kids swam. The decision was made to have dinner in our suite via room service. When reviewing the time we spent, Maddie reported the time we spent eating and hanging out in the room was her favorite.We were allowed a late check out which made it possible to do activities on Sunday, collect our things, check out and make the train.We would recommend the Intercontinental and plan to stay their again on another grandkid overnight.

This stay started terribly but the staff made up for it. We stayed here for one night the weekend after Christmas. We arrived a little after check-in time of 4 PM. We were told there are no rooms available and that we would not be able to check in until around 6 PM. They were pretty much telling everyone that. We were in town to shop so no big deal. We checked our bags and went shopping. They said they would text me when the room was available. We were out shopping and about 6:30 PM I decide to call and check in since we have 8:30 reservations for dinner. They tell me the room is still not available but they will 'put a rush on it' We got back to the hotel around 7 PM and checked to see if we could check in. They did have our room available even though no one thought to notify us. We got our room keys and went up to the room. Keys did not work. Went back and spoke to someone else said they wrote the wrong room number down. They did give us a drink and breakfast coupons which was nice. The room itself was nice and adequately sized for Chicago. There was a shower and a tub which was nice. We had a nice side view of Michigan Avenue from the 7th floor. After we returned to the hotel from dinner we stopped to get a drink in MJ's bar downstairs. It was nice with a decent crowd. The breakfast buffet was really good the next morning.The staff that we dealt with in person while checking in were very polite and apologetic. I am not sure that I would choose to stay here again given all the choices in Chicago. The location is great on Michigan Ave.
"I stayed there with my mother and gran. We stayed for 3 nights and there was a wonderful women there who helped us with everything we needed, she was funny and not as serious as i would've thought the staff here were. There was a Starbucks connecting to the hotel, and again the staff here were friendly and willing to help. The decor was beautiful and everything was clean. It was a good location and although the hotel was lovely, the prices of the stuff in the fridge however, were not. There was a walgreens and a 711 on every street corner practically! The water taxi was maybe 3 building away and you took this to pier 49. The tour bus was also just right outside. I would highly recommend this hotel if you were looking in this price range, worth every penny!"
"This lovely hotel has a exquisite swimming pool and meeting rooms that make you feel like royalty. Even the fold out beds are comfortable.But best of all, the staff is great.I was waiting for a package that did not arrive. I spoke with Sylvia Rollins about it and she very kindly and patiently asked about all the details. Then, she connected the dots and found a package that had been mailed to their hotel with the name of my company, but not my name or my room number. She was wonderful and I wanted to thank her in public.This note also can serve as a reminder -- if anyone is having a package sent to a hotel, be sure to have your name AS WELL AS your company name on the package.Thanks again to the Intercontinental for a wonderful stay."
"I spent 4 nights at the InterContinental recently and was definitely pleased with the property and the staff. The location was very convenient and allowed me to walk everywhere except to/from the airport (the train station is just a few blocks away). I stayed on the 26th floor but did have some road noise to contend with. I did find that he IHG website did not offer me the best rate on this particular stay however given that I have had problems with 3rd party sites in the past I will simply shop around and then call the property direct to make my reservation. Would definitely recommend this property if you are in the area.

"I reserved a king ""superior"" room as part of an event block more than a month prior to the event. Upon arrival (20 minutes after check-in time started) I was advised that the room size I selected was ""more of a preference than a reservation"" and that the room type I selected was sold out.I acknowledge that this is probably a common thing if a hotel gets full for them to downgrade groups with discounted rates, but when I went online I saw plenty of king rooms and suites still available at this hotel! I called to ask for one of those rooms ""even if I had to pay for it"" and was not met with a conciliatory voice in any way, shape, or form. I was surprised that this class of hotel would make so little of an effort to help solve a problem that clearly had a solution. I called customer service for the hotel and was told that someone from my hotel would call me back but they never did. I don't think I can stay at this hotel chain again, how could I ever trust that my reservations would be respected? If you are organizing a group please keep this review in mind!"
"We booked our stay in Chicago last minute and got a great deal for the international. We arrived into the city late in the evening and were welcomed by the beautifully lit magnificent mile with all its Christmas decor Check in was mad - so many people and so loud! Turned out it's pretty much like that all the time - the Starbucks in the lobby too (we used the one across the street, no lines) Our check in was fast and impersonal - no info given etc just here's your keys have a good stay (it's line management as opposed to guest experience)Our room was on the 35th floor with huge windows overlooking three sides of the city - it was fantastic! The room was large, tastefully decorated, a huge Devine bed, a beautiful bathroom! All in all it was very impressive! The location is also great. Subway station a few blocks away. Shops/bars/restaurants right outside the door. The open top bus stops one block away. It was perfect.The concierge recommended two great pizza places and gave us his card so we wouldn't have to line up at east side Gino's - this was a big plus as the line was long, it was cold and we were hungry! (Great restaurant!!!)Our only grievance - we stayed three nights - on our second night we were heading to bed at about 1am when suddenly the corridor filled with a large party heading into the adjoining room. Then the loud music, shouting etc started. Our room had a joint door to this room (presidential suite) and party goers spent the next hour trying to open the door or standing on the other side of the door chatting, laughing etc! There was a constant stream of people coming and going and each time the main door to the suite would bang! After over an hour we called the reception to request they be asked to keep the noise down and to also resist trying to get into our room (if you did happen to start nodding off you were jolted from your sleep suddenly by the fright of someone pulling the door down!!) The girl on the phone was polite and said she would send the manager up. Twenty minutes later and still no manger the party getting louder and louder we called down again to be told the manager had been up - to which we advised this was not the case5minutes later the manager and two staff arrived. Such was the noise level we could hear the whole conversation from our room. The occupants of the room apologized and agreed to scale the party down in 30minutes!! Now in fairness they did - but I was a little taken aback that the manager agreed to his suggestion he'd only carry on partying for 30 more minutes when she knew it was effecting other guests Anyway all in all it was a good stay and I would go back We didn't use the bar/restaurant or pool area Near By great spots:House of Blues The Turtle club (tortoise??)East side Gino's"
"We stayed 4nightsi in intercontinental in early December .After10 hours flight we arrived at hotel having booked on Amoma website ,unfortunately there was no record of our booking .thankfully a most kind ,warm and welcoming receptionist advised us to take a seat in bar and organised a complimentary drink .She tried contacting the website in our presence for at least half hour .we had ref no and all details .Finally we got a. room on 19th floor , beautiful,spacious.and spotless .Our stay was really comfortable .We loved Enos wine bar, we enjoyed our steaks in Michael Jordan's .This is a busy.busy hotel because of great location .I loved the convenience of Starbucks on ground floor .Lovely pool and leisure centre.I can only say congratulations and thank you to All staff for quality service and Great welcome.(Warning !Do not book on Amoma .com )"
"We just stayed at this hotel for the weekend. We enjoyed our stay. The hotel is very nice, clean, and wonderful location. Great pool area ( but the shallow part of the pool is 4ft deep) We easily walked to several popular tourist destinations. Very quiet in the room.I will say that $67/night for parking is INSANE!! Use an online parking spot finder to find nearby parking for way cheaper.The room had all the amenities that we wanted ( in room safe, large flat screen tv and mini-fridge) but I will say that we were disappointed in a few things in the room itself. 1) The mini fridge is just that-MINI! We could not take anything out of the fridge to store the snacks/drinks that we brought because there is a sign that says "" anything removed from the fridge for more than 30 seconds will be considered purchased."" We have never seen this before so we were wondering what kind of amazing technology feature this fridge had. Needless to say, we didn't want to get charged for anything, so we ended up filling the bathroom sink with ice to keep items cold. #2- this room is SMALL! There were 2 full beds ( would have been nice if they at least had queens- it is very hard for 2 adults to sleep in this full size bed) a desk, and a chair to sit in and it was cramped! #3 We added on a package to our stay and were not informed of the benefits of the package at check in. Luckily I had done my own research and knew what the package included. The in room movie ( which was part of the package) was charged to our room and we had to go to the front desk to get it taken off. No apology given for the inconvenience. #4 there is ONE ice machine on the 7th floor. We were on the 20th. Enough said...Breakfast buffet was decent- coffee, juice included- good selection of fruits, pastries, bacon/sausage, etc.Bellman held our luggage at check out so we could be tourists for the afternoon. They were very friendly.All in all, a nice overnight stay. I don't think we were overly impressed with anything, but not overly disappointed either.

"Couldn't ask for a better location, close to all shopping, sightseeing and restaurants, parking. Read about the history of the hotel, very interesting. The swimming pool is beautiful and restored like it was back when it was created with beautiful tile work and stained glass windows. Set up like a lap pool, which can be a little difficult for youngsters who just want to splash around. Won't see another like it. Very friendly front desk staff. Rooms are small, but comfortable beds and updated decor and clean. Coffee shop right next to lobby which was great in the morning before a walk on the Mag mile.

"We live in the suburbs of Chicago and came down wanting to stay the night in a hotel with a pool. The Intercontinental was great! Water was warm, about 4 other families with kids of all ages. Lots of fun! We brought a ball and played catch. Hotels.com offered rate with breakfast - the only way you could eat breakfast in the hotel, otherwise buffet was $28 for adults and $14 for kids. Food was fantastic but as with everything in the city - pricey. We will be back!!!"
"Asked for an upgrade after purchasing on priceline, we were given a room that had two windows facing a brick wall, and was so saturated with cigarette smoke in the bathroom that we literally could not breathe after showering. Ruined an attempt at a romantic in-town getaway. Informing the staff upon checkout resulted in a non-committal grunt and a gimme-yer-money-and-get-lost attitude, from this shabby property with terrible customer service coasting on location and architectural history. Will never be back."
Came to check in on Saturday in the morning with an extremely polite and professional female front desk agent with a unique name. Night Manager from the Previous night booked us into a Jr. Suite. My buddies loved the room as they could watch one football game and me and another could watch another game. Pool was great. Get there early or it will be overrun with kids (Understandable). Breakfast was on point. So many options. Will def stay again. Also Free WSJ in which i was a huge fan of at Breakfast. Great Location.
"We were up around the 30th floor of the historic tower, with three windows looking over the city and a sliver of the lake. Beautiful! There's a Starbucks attached to the lobby. Parking is outrageous though! Managed by an outside company. You can save $20+/night by walking a block or so and parking elsewhere. We left the kids with family so this stay was just my husband and I. The food at the attached restaurant was great too, and we had a lovely seat by the window watching life go by in Michigan Ave."
We arrived on time for our 3pm check-in. The room was not ready. It wasn't ready until 4:45.The only compensation we received was 4 complimentary drink tickets which we couldn't even use because the restaurant was full due to none of the rooms being ready.The wait to check the luggage at the bellstand was in excess of 20 mins and so was the wait to retrieve the car from valet.The staff are very rude and don't seem to care about their guests.The room was decent but you can find better in the area for a similar price.I will not stay here again
"Great location, luxury and atmosphere. We booked this hotel for the weekend prior to Christmas and it was the perfect choice. Close to shopping, restaurants, nightlife and entertainment in the heart of the city. Clean, courteous, and excellent customer service. Parking is a little pricy, but you can park very close to the hotel and pay 1/3 of their parking price.

"I couldn't have asked for a better location. Smacked right in the middle of the Magnificent Mile on Michigan Ave across from Nordstrom (my fav store!!). And got such a great deal!!From check in to check out, everything was flawless. The staff was so nice & explained my charges and deposits to me when I didn't understand. The room itself was a little small. Smaller than any of the rooms I've stayed in while in Chicago (I've stayed at 2 other hotels in this same location, these rooms were particularly smaller in comparison to the other two) but the room was comfortable and had a nice view! The bed was comfortable. It did get a little tight when there were two of us in the room unless one of us was laying in bed while the other walked around. Really a tight squeeze but for a single person, I think it would be perfect. Housekeeping did a good job, I was there for 4 nights. The first two days I was there, housekeeping came after noon (while I was gone), the last 2 days, they were at my door by 8:30am, really? Housekeeping at 830am? Since when? Anyway, I was still in bed both of those times (I'm from California so it was 630am for me!!) that's just way too early seeing how check out isn't even until noon. Location location location. Couldn't have asked for a better location & with such a steal on the rate. I can't complain. I would definitely stay here again should the chance arise!"
"Single night stay was awesome.Thursday was our anniversary so we thought we would check priceline and try to get a downtown hotel just for the night. We blind bid priceline 4.5 star hotel for $75 and got the Intercontinental. This is a great price for a Michigan Ave hotel and probably shouldn't be expected normally.We were expecting a bad room because most hotels have some bad rooms set aside for priceline/hotwire bidders. However, we were greeted warmly by Rey at the front desk and we told him that we came downtown for a night for our anniversary. He half-smiled (which may have been legit...but my cynical mind thought that he was thinking we were trying to scam him). Anyway, we asked if it was possible to get a king bed and he said not only could he do that but he would upgrade us to a suite, free wi-fi, and 2 Starbucks gift cards (Starbucks is in the hotel lobby)! VERY NICE!The suite was on the 10th floor and in the ""new"" building. Apparently there is a newer building and an older building. I read a review on TripAdvisor that the older part has larger rooms....I can not verify that. Our suite was a good size.The king suite had a sitting room with a couch and a chair and tv. The other side had a bed, couch & TV. the bathroom was clean and spacious. Everything was nice. The only downside was the fridge. We went out to eat and had leftovers but the fridge is one of those that is packed with overpriced stuff and if you take anything out, you are hit with the outrageous fees. There is a tiny space for your personal stuff...maybe 6""x6"" space inside the fridge for personal items. Can't complain for the price but if we were to have paid a normal high price, it would have caused resentment.A note on the carpet design: It immediately looks very worn but after a while you realize that that is the design. It is an unflattering design just because it looks worn and old, but it isn't.We overslept the next day and asked for a late check out and they again were extremely accommodating. The staff is just outstanding.Good: The Staff, Clean, modern decor, wi-fi signal (strong), lobby opens on Michigan Ave, Valet parking, near everything.Cons: Parking cost $65 + valet tips, refrigerator space, windows (screen was torn).We would love to stay at this hotel again! Overall, it was a great experience and we wish we had the time to stay a few more nights. I would highly recommend this hotel."
"We arrived early, so of course our room wasn't ready, which was expected. Our room was on a higher floor and facing Michigan Avenue in the Historic Tower and it was totally quiet for our three night stay. We had a rather large room and it was clean. Our only problem was that when we left that nobody would answer the phones downstairs to have someone come pick-up our luggage. There wasn't any hotel guests at the Bellman Stand when we arrived and requested someone to retrieve our bags out of our room. Unfortunately that process took almost 15 minutes before our bags arrived in the lobby. Also, the hotel didn't seem too busy for December.


Room Tip: Much quieter on a higher floor.

"Visited Chicago in the Summer, a city that we'd always want to see and it did not disappoint. We chose the InterContinental Chicago for its great location. It is on North Michigan Ave right in the heart of the city close to all the shops, in fact close to everything. Staff were friendly and welcoming, service was excellent, rooms a reasonable size and most importantly clean. We really enjoyed our stay."
"Put in simple words: amazing hotel for a leisure stay! Great and awesome experience at this venue. The hotel is extremely well located, next to shops and attractions. At check in my ambassador level was recognized and upgraded to a marvelous suite in the historic tower. Staff very profesional and caring. Breakfast buffet really nice even though the space is not actually large. Fast check out. Everything was as expected. Congratulations to the hotel management.

"I stayed for a week during RSNA meeting in November/December. The location is very good, right in the middle of maginificent mile. The room is good, standard for this level. However, it is disappointed that there is no free Wi-Fi, not in the room or in the lobby. In 2014, it should be available for customer. Moreover, I was charged for using the gym. I paid over 300 dollars a night, and still have to pay for wi-fi, gym, and breakfast.I feel like the hotel is taking advantage of the customers during the highly demand time of RSNA. I will not stay here for the next RSNA."
"This was a weekend getaway for the family (myself, wife, and sons ages 9 & 11). First of all we chose this hotel because I have a lot of reward points and this stay was free for us. To be fair I'm not sure we would have chosen this hotel if we were paying...not for any particular reason, but InterContinental is generally not a brand we choose when traveling together. It's not quite as kid friendly as some others.We had a nice stay. From the beginning it started off great. We were greeted as we got out of the cab and helped inside. I'm a Platinum Elite member and was checked in by a friendly guy at the Ambassador desk. I was upgraded to a deluxe room and given a couple of free coffee coupons for Starbucks which is attached to the lobby. After in our rooms for a while we heard a knock at the door and were met by a staff member bringing a plate of fruit and a bottle of spring water and thanking us for being IHG members. Nice touch! Sometimes it's the little things that make a difference.The location is great. Only about a block north of the river on Michigan Ave. We've stayed further north and now prefer this location. There's a lot more to do especially if you're traveling with kids. It's walking distance to Millennium Park, Grant Park, Art Institute, and if you're ambitious you can walk to The Museum of Science and Industry and Shedd Aquarium.Plenty of restaurants in the area too. Michael Jordan's Steakhouse is in the hotel although we did not go there. Billy Goat Tavern is nearby which was good...really anything you would ever want is within walking distance.Overall a great hotel with a great staff. The only complaint I have is the indoor pool is for ""lap swimming only"" as the sign said. My boys were pretty disappointed. I'm sure we could have snuck in some swimming and nobody would have cared, but I didn't want to be THAT family. And we really didn't have much time to lounge around at the hotel anyway so no big deal. We would definitely stay again."
"The rooms in the new tower are more modern, but the historic tower has more space in the rooms and it is easier to access the pool from it. I love the pool, but it does not seem to have an obvious handicapped accessible entrance and involved a lot of steps to get to. That said, seldom does a hotel have a 10 foot deep Olympic length pool accessible from the twelfth floor. Breakfast was spendy but quite delicious. I suspect the main floor Starbucks gets a lot of business on account of the in house dining prices. Expect to pay 65 for parking. The beds are very comfortable, but alas, the stairs aren't a good option for quick access to the main floor or lobby as the new tower stairwell empties out into an emergency exit on the ground level or on the second floor into the kitchen. That was awkward as someone who prefers to skip the elevator wait. I wish that had been clearly marked. I would go back as the location is great and i love the full size pool and the classic charm of the older posts of the building, but i will remember to make sure that i am in the right party of the building for my taste next time."
"This is a good Intercontinental hotel in the heart of Chicago. Located on the Magnificient Mile, there is no shortage of good restaurants or things to see nearby.The hotel is on the older side, but feels more historic than old. The lobby is impressive, and definitely exudes luxury. The rooms, although recently renovated, feel a bit outdated. I stayed in a one bedroom suite in the historic tower. The size of the room was impressive, but the decor is a tad gloomy. The bed was very comfortable, and the sheets were of high quality. There is a good selection of beverages in the minibar.The staff at this hotel is top notch. Service is clearly important here.Treatment for Ambassador and Royal Ambassadors members is good, but not great. They do have a dedicated check-in area. When I got to my room there was no in-room gift or fruit as promised. Also the card left in my room was for a completely different member. Sloppy mistakes in my opinion, especially for a Royal Ambassador member."
"I really enjoyed the intercontinental and the front desk staff was superb.I asked for a little extra floor space in my price range and they kindly accommodated. And because of a family emergency I had to check out early and again, they kindly did so.The fitness area has free weights as well as machines, which I appreciate. And although I didn't use the pool area, it has to be seen - it has a tiered table area overlooking the very large pool area - a remnant of another era, but lovely to see.One negative - $65 for overnight parking...outrageous. I parked at McCormack of $20 and cab'd back!I like the atmosphere of this place and hope our company uses them again in the future.

"My husband and I were in town for a conference and booked a last minute stay at the InterContinental through Priceline after our original lodging proved less than stellar. The front desk staff was very helpful in getting us checked in early and making sure we had everything we needed; all things that went above and beyond what is expected. The room itself was beautiful and well kept. The one thing that could be a negative is the rooms are a little smaller, but as we were staying in the older side of the hotel, not unexpected, and not a problem for us. Every staff member we encountered was helpful and went out of their way to make our stay nice. Will definitely be staying here again."
"I travel a lot and can't get excited by hotels - quite, clean, efficient is usually enough. Occasionally one does really impress. I am so glad I tried this one out. The location is great and it's a really nice building too. The team found me a great room on the top floor away from the lift (my tip for any hotel check you're not by the elevators) and have looked after me well. Added bonus that there are three cafe/restaurants in the lobby - Starbucks, Michael Jordan bar/cafe and a winebar. I often judge a hotel by whether I would bring my wife back here for a visit and I would definitely do that with this one.

"We are a couple with my wife attending the 100th RSNA conference in Chicago.When we travel we typically use the hotels associated with the IHG Group - essentially the Holiday Inn, Crowne Plaza and Intercontinental.My wife is a Platinum Priority Club member - and also prior to departing Australia I also re-joined her in the Ambassador Club. The latter is for when staying at Intercontinental only hotels - where you can get an extended check out, some freebies on arrival etc - and also a complimentary one night stay voucher.This is not our first time to Chicago but was our first time at the Intercontinental. The hotel was completely booked due to the thousands of people attending the conference during the week.Our room was not available upon my early arrival about 10.30 - and so they kindly put me into another room so that I could at least update my emails etc. Shortly after 12 noon they phoned to advise the room was available. When I saw it - I thought WOW. Level 38, corner suite - glorious city and lake views, big separate lounge, big king bedroom, big bathroom - we only booked a normal king room and so this upgrade was an amazing surprise. When my wife saw the room after her first day at the conference she was suitable impressed as well. Thank you Intercontinental. You will continue to have our loyalty.From my perspective the hotel is very well situated for what I did during the day - shop! It takes about ten minutes to walk to a choice of two Macys stores - one south and one north. Great for post thanksgiving shopping sales.This would be our preferred hotel of choice when visiting Chicago again."
"This hotel is famous...Famous for its location on the Magnificent Mile, Michigan Avenue, close to great stores and shops, not far away from the loop and some museums.The historical part is a strange mix of Middle Age period, waiting for Lancelot and Robin Hood, and the new building used to be another hotel. Rooms can be either great or disappointing, at random, for the returning guest. This time, we got a room in the modern part. Nothing much to complain about but nothing to rejoice for. Average... The heating system was so noisy that ear plugs where needed.Breakfast is nice, staff smiling and food on the right side. Michael Jordan's restaurant is a traditional meat restaurant, high price with average value.So, good address but do not expect too much !

"Perfect location for walking to everything!! Tiny rooms but well appointed and very clean! Kudos to housekeeping -- probably one of the cleanest hotel rooms and bathrooms I have stayed in! Ask for a room with a view as there are many beautiful views from this location! Appreciated the early check in very much! Friendly helpful doormen! TV service was down hotel wide during our stay and front desk staff wasn't very helpful in making accommodations for that.

"The best location to be in the Chicago downtown. Plenty of shopping opportunities, corner bakery, bus stops, train station, river all a few steps from the hotel. Starbucks is located right in the hotel lobby but it closes at 8:00 PM.Room was really nice with high end fixtures, good TV channels, very clean and very nice view of Michigan Avenue. We were on Floor 5 but there was no noise from the road below whatsoever. Complimentary amenities: toiletries, coffee maker with supplied in the room, bath robes.Important notes: Parking at the hotel is $65 a day and there is no free wifi in the room. Best time to be in Chicago for first timers in Summer weather wise. We like to be there in winters when there are no lines and you can enjoy the dinning and the shopping.

"We spent a few days in Chicago for Thanksgiving and selected the Intercontinental because of its swimming pool. We got very interesting rates and actually the room (new tower) was better than expected. Great views on the beautiful Michigan Ave buildings, two comfortable beds and all you may need in a modern structure. But you are in an historic Hotel right in the middle of the Magnificent Mile. Few weak points: the room size: even if the room is bigger than many other downtown hotels, don't expect so much space. The WiFi fee: a Hotel should provide free connection at least in a few common areas Lastly the cost of the parking ( $65 for 8-24 hours ). On the other side, you can easily walk in one of the many WiFi friendly places and park at the River East Center Self Park and you will save some money. Last, the pool is a gem considering that you're in downtown. We can enjoy swimming in separated lanes, admire the intricate architecture and spend some time in the sauna ( inside the locker rooms )."
"We just visited Chicago last weekend for the Magnificent Mile Christmas parade celebration and stayed at the I.C. Nice room, very quiet, staff and concierge were very attentive, helpful and personable, especially since they'd had a major flood which was impacting check in for lots of guests for this event and a Bears game! The only negatives were no onsite breakfast. Loved the MJ steakhouse bar, appetizers were unusual and delicious-don't miss the garlic bread! Hotel was in a great spot for sightseeing and public transportation.

"Decent priced hotel at the center of downtown. Right on Michigan Ave and great access to anywhere downtown. They recognize IHG Plat, and was provided a choice of free bottle water or 600 IHG pts. Wireless internet is free, but very slow. Was also give a Starbucks voucher for a free coffee. Room is a bit dated and lighting is insufficient. Nice exercise room and indoor pool, with a good dry sauna."
"We stayed here for Lights festival parade.. On the ""right side of the street"" and near Pioneer park. AMAZING location for this affair, parade view Michicagn Ave. room, 967 though our window was nailed shut we could'nt hear . The room service excellent, no reservations at Michael Jordan's that night open, no sweat they will deliver a great steak right to your room kids menue is great yummy ice cream vanilla. Dont order desert not that delish the 23 layer cake and vanilla creme brulle for us were so so. Also the kids Mac & cheese has parmesan cheese crust on top not traditional my 6 yr old hated it. But the cheesburgers,, Amazing. all for $10. The pool was 20'style, era of long ago in the historic section, crown molding s, 4 tier sitting area sconces and water feature. The pool is DEEP, don't be fooled bring those floaties for the kids. Jr olympic sized as well.... draw back no bathroom on the premises,,, have to go down 2 flights of stairs across the pretty reception area with wet feet to get into the lockers area. The hotel had a water pipe freeze and two elevators were in working order only which made for a great adventure going down the stairs from the 9th floor with our luggage and cutting through the kitchen at Jordan's restaurant with our kids and a million waitstaff buzzing about during lunch rush hour! Apparently the 2nd floor is the end of the stair escape or you end up in the banquet hall. The rooms are small but cozy and comfy the carpet a bit dated in the new section of the hotel.. Loved the personal touch of texting our early check-in request when our room was ready and the beautiful Christmas tree in the lobby under the sweeping staircase. Also the valet service pull up drop keys and go was excellent right by front doors. Overall a good experince minus the elevator situation. Make sure you enroll with IHG hotel group or no Wi Fi service in the rooms. We will try the Conrad I think next year but will definetly keep this hotel as an option. Thank you"
"Stayed here for a night on the end of a business trip, the location is great, about a 2 minute walk from the river and right beside great shopping, restaurants and sightseeing. On arrival, there was a mix up with my booking as my travel agent had double booked a room in my name which the person on the desk seemed to think was my fault. The decor of the hotel was nice in the common areas, lovely lobby, bar and restaurant. The leisure centre was also very nice, especially the pool which was beautifully maintained, however once again let down by the staff members - very abrubt, rude and unwelcoming. I also think its a cheek to charge residents for use of the leisure centre ($13)! The standard bedrooms themselves are well appointed albeit in a strange layout. They are long and narrow which does not give a lot of walking space between the bed and the opposite wall/desk. Bathroom was OK (however the bath is tiny) and the toilet was not fully cleaned. I stayed on the 15th floor and I could hear people talking at street level, so the sound of traffic as you can imagine did not make for a quiet night - definite need for sound proofing on the windows.The carpets on the corridors are badly in need of replacement. My experience of the staff was somewhat redeemed on checkout - I had been wrongly charged for a minibar item whih the nice girl checking me out apologised for and was most polite. Also the bellstand staff who looked after my luggage were very friendly. Overall, I'm not sure I would recommend this hotel if you are looking for somewhere with a friendly warm atmosphere.

"Apart from the superb location and the gorgeous exterior this hotel can certainly NOT be compared to the other InterContinental Hotels I've stayed at before (Hong Kong, Boston, Singapore,...).The check in desk looks and seems like a cheap exhibition hall with a huge LED display behind the counter. Check-in was very fast and impersonal. We weren't even pointed towards the elevators or told what floor we were on.Our room was tiny but the worst is yet to come...The drains in the bathroom started smelling like sewer in the middle of the night. My sister and I were both woken up by the smell and couldn't fall back asleep as it was too much to take. We left the room at 6:30am to wonder the streets as we just couldn't stay in the room any longer. It was disgusting!!!When we left in the morning we mentioned the smell to the Concierge who said she would send someone up. No apology, nothing.We asked for the manager at check-out and he offered us a free breakfast (at 11:30am!). When we told him we already had our breakfast he said: ""well, your room was already paid for so I can't do anything about that. Why don't you ask for me again before you leave and I get you lunch"". Yeah right, as if we would be begging for lunch in a hotel that made us sleep inside a sewer. No thank you. We're in Chicago about every 6 weeks and luckily there's many wonderful hotels on Michigan Ave that actually appreciate their customers. We won't be returning."
"This is a very centrally located hotel, designed for convenience and with well equipped rooms. However, wifi connection is expensive per day and to eat in the hotel is expensive and average, while the bar facilities are standard. The hotel is designed for business conferences and business travellers rather than tourists so it feels a bit sterile but overall the positives outweigh the negatives."
"I made a late decision to fly to Chicago and join my daughter (who attends Wheaton College) for her birthday earlier this month. And with shows and conventions on going, I tried to find a room at other hotels I already experienced, like the Hilton Suites and the Marriott, but to no avail. I was surprised to have been able to find a room at the InterContinental Chicago. And ultimately had such a pleasant check-in experience after flying some 18 hours. After I checked, I remembered being an Rewards Club member. And upon informing Rey Andujar (the same gentleman who checked me in) about my membership, not only did he ensure my membership number was logged in but I then witnessed a quality of service and the attention from him that ultimately convinced me to subscribe to the Ambassador Club. I have not regretted doing so and the experience has convinced me that the InterContinental should be at the top of my list when booking hotels in any part of the world."
"Excellent hotel great location. The staff are always helpful and polite. The rooms were great, the beds were so comfy and the room was toasty even though it was -10 outside. The gym and swimming pool was great the staff were really helpful. And it opened early:). The food in the restaurant in the lobby (Michael Jordan's) was excellent but was far too much for my daughter and I to finish. The concierge service were also very helpful. And finally the doorman was always helpful, cheerful and polite even though he was outside in that awful cold"
"I disclose that I have elite status with this chain. In contrast to my recent stay in Paris, this hotel is huge, impersonal and hindered by its size. The staff were varied. I watched staff doing all the right things, exuding the culture I expect in such a property. But as others mentioned- the service is SLOW and the phone is answered after minutes and an intolerable phone tree.The room was well appointed but lights were far to reach and multiple switches. The bed was comfortable and the room large with an excellent view. The TV was undersized for such a room and viewing distance. The gym was small for such a large property and for others it was extra ( group and ambassadors, free). The pool is spectacular.I may or may not stay again at this property but my expectations will be much lower."
We stayed here 2 days ago and I have to say the stay was almost perfect the only issue that we had is a maintenance issue and it's kind of weird but the windows in the room won't shut and seal properly and with it being so cold and windy there was a lot of cold air coming into the room other than that I couldn't ask for a better stay the room was quite large all the furniture was in good shape the bed was comfortable good size bathroom the staff was extremely friendly and accommodating even sending up some cheese and crackers and a bottle of wine which was definitely a nice surprise on top of the upgrade that I got on top of all of that the hotel is very centrally located no matter which direction you want to go on Michigan Ave I would definitely recommend this hotel
"I stayed at the hotel for 3 nights, and was upgraded to a 2 bedroom apartment on the 40th floor. Great views. It was in the older side of the hotel, but still nice.The only thing i found a little wrong about this hotel was that when you rang instant service it wasnt very instant. You were generally on hold for a while until someone would assist to your enquiry and i had to ring up 3 times throughout the day to have the minibar restocked. Even asking to have the minibar stocked up, they wanted to know what had to be refilled, isnt this the job of the staff to sort out, not mine!The gym was great, plenty of weights and runners to do your thing, and the pool area is all heated, so you can swim all year around.Good hotel, and concierge are helpful too.Maybe another operator or two on the instant service could speed things up?!


Room Tip: Room 4000 is good if you are two couples.

"My wife and I checked in on a leisurely Sunday. We were given no directions to the room at all and, after trial and error, discovered (on the 3rd attempt) that the three different elevator banks take you to different parts of the property. Another guest who had had the same problem theorized that the front desk prefers it when guests have a porter carry their luggage.The room was very nice with views of Lake Michigan in the distance. The mini-bar had a notice that guests would be charged for any beverages removed for more than 30 seconds so I just kept my breakfast (a 2 liter jug of Diet Coke) on the table and trekked to the ice machine the next morning. But the policy seemed a bit draconian to me.You walk out of the hotel lobby and are on the Magnificent Mile. As a longtime fan of Chicago, that wins bonus points. But I thought the Intercontinental a bit snobby for my taste and not a good value price-wise."
This hotel is a wonderful Art Deco building in the best location. The staff were all efficient and friendly. The concierge was really helpful. My room was on the 8th floor looking over the front : great views. The room was a little small but comfortable. Very clean. Looked a little in need to tlc. The wardrobe door slats were broken. No light in the wardrobe so you couldn't see clothes. Bathroom was small but fine. Breakfast offered a good selection : it's a buffet. The room could be made to look a little nicer but the food was good.  Best thing about the hotel is the building and location and staff.
"The were spotless! We had a view of Michigan Ave. the location was so ideal. Just walk out the front and start shopping! We were close to so many good places to eat. The Corner bakery is across the street which is a great place for breakfast, Grand Luxe and Lawry's are only a few blocks away. The staff were courteous and friendly. Parking cost $65 at the hotel but it was easy breezy. Be sure to read up on the history of the hotel, it's very interesting. And also check out the pool!"
"Stayed one night at the Hotel Intercontinental with the family for a downtown birthday celebration. We had one room on the 37th floor of the Historic Tower and one in the Main Tower. Views from the Historic tower were great. Location is great - right on Michigan Ave across from Nordstrom's. Rates are not cheap - $322 per night. Parking is absurdly expensive - $65 per day. The rooms are nice. The linens are soft. The bathroom is marble. The Continental restaurant has a nice buffet breakfast, but it is $28 for adults and $8 for kids. The indoor pool is very nice and is accessible from either tower on the 12th floor. The fitness center is nice, free weights, treadmills and machines. Locker room has a sauna. There is a Starbucks and Michael Jordan's Steakhouse on the ground floor. If you can get a reasonable rate, this is a great downtown hotel."
"This is a hotel for business people and tourists. The staff is friendly, and service is very good. The room was bright, the bed comfortable, and the bathroom brightly lit with a good shower. This is one of the few hotels I have stayed in with a pool designed for lap swimming, and I took full advantage of it. Location is excellent. The red line subway is only a couple of blocks away, and it is easy to get around the city.


Room Tip: Both towers are fine.

"My wife and I recently spent a weekend celebrating our wedding Anniversary at this hotel. From the moment we drove up to the door till the time we left, we had a great experience. The location is wonderful for reaching any place in the downtown area of Chicago. Great food, shopping, museums, the beautiful lakefront and entertainment are literally moments away. All of the staff treated us with courtesy, kindness and respect. Our room was wonderful and we had a great view, looking west at the city. The room was large, clean and comfortable. We were sorry to leave! We will be back!"
"This hotel was perfect for my husband and myself...You are literally less than a mile away from the Navy Pier (back of hotel), Millennium Park (left of hotel), John Hancock Bldg (right of hotel), and straight ahead is shopping shopping shopping and lots of places to eat. Very similar to 5th Avenue in NYC but less busy and very clean city. We LOVED Chicago! My husband and I are IHG Gold members and are fans of the Intercontinental brand. It was what we expected. The service was exceptional from check in to check out. We arrived at the hotel at 8:00 a.m. and concierge did find us a room and we were able to go and sleep for a few hours until we were ready to get up and go out into the city. Since we are gold members we were given a access code for the gym and the wifi (no fee otherwise there is a fee). The pool is complimentary for all guests. Room 3704 (37th floor only 5 rooms on floor) - We were in the ""old"" tower. The room was a decent size with a large bathroom. King bed with feather down comforter and pillows (really comfortable). The room had 40 inch flat screen with tilt view. A safe and in room coffee maker (under TV in console). There was a desk/chair, a lounge chair in the room as well. The bathroom had a tub in the far corner and a stand up shower in the other corner. Small sink area although large mirror and area to lay your toiletries out. The towels weren't great I actually was kind of disappointed on the towels (texture not soft and fluffy or really large). The water pressure wasn't great the hotter you wanted the water. Other than that the restroom was great like I said it was really spacious. The tub set up was great. We never heard anyone else on the floor or on the elevators with us. We had a great view of the lake and the city side. We were told by a maid the ""old"" tower was going to be renovated in the spring. We were just curious because of reviews we had read. Our room was perfectly fine but updating a property never hurts!We used the gym it has state of the art cardio equipment but not so great weight equipment. It was fine but it would've been nicer if it matched the cardio equipment. Cardio on first level, weights and pool on second level (floor for gym/pool is FC).We did not eat at the Michael Jordan Steak house because we have one near us and wanted to try things we could only get in Chicago. I reviewed many of the places. There is Starbucks attached to the hotel lobby. There are Starbucks EVERYWHERE (I'm a Starbucks girl so I was really happy about that). In Starbucks there is a coffee carafe that says Intercontinental on it with cups near the sugar/milk station. I'm assuming it was Starbucks coffee complimentary for guests. I drink ice so I paid for mine. I thought that was nice. In lobby they also have computers set up so you can print your boarding passes another nice touch. We will be back and more likely than not stay here again! I would recommend this hotel."
"I stayed at this hotel for 3 nights for a business meeting. While this hotel has beautiful architecture, the rooms were ordinary. If I were to visit the Chicago again I would stay elsewhere. Positives: clean room, plenty of power hook ups in room, great lemon verbena soaps Negatives: room not ready until after checkin, bags took 30 mins to arrive at the room, the concierge did not answer the phone the 2 times I calledThe worst part, when our bus arrived a staff member came running out of the hotel yelling at our driver because he parked partialy in front of a private garage space. There was no one needing out of the garage. He continued to yell at our driver, who did not have anywhere else to park, until all of our luggage was unloaded. Needless to say this unprofessional employee started our stays out on the wrong foot. Kudos to our driver for not engaging. Slow service at the restaurant did not meet expectations. Lastly, the bed was a rock."
"I must admit that the Hotel is located right where you want to be if you are looking to do some shopping. Blocks away from some of the Top brand name stores. Nordstroms right in front. The Lobby has access to a Starbucks and Michael Jordan's Grill. The breakfast is a little pricey at $28 USD per person at the Continental. Another downside about big city (Chicago, NYC, Etc) hotels is that they charge just about everything ! The Gym and pool has a fee. The Internet service has a fee! Etc. Etc. I would definitely stay again."
"I love to get away in my own city and this location can't be beat! Check-in, Valet-lower (Wacker) to make life easier, all easy and friendly. (Try ParkWhiz.) The ease of getting to the Lake for a night walk with the wicked waves of the Halloween Howler, walking up to Rush Street for dinner and cupcakes, people watching on Michigan Avenue and wandering along the river. The breakfast buffet and service was excellent but the concierge was the best! Rachel was able to get us into a restaurant that was booked and made suggestions that were appropriate for my 15 year old daughter and me... We secured tickets to the All-Blacks Game. (Who did they play?) Many concierges at other hotels seem stressed but Rachel took the time to deal with us in a friendly way, This location is the best. The rooms are okay, (although the bedding is great) but when we decide to stay in the city, and we get an awesome rate online, that is not our priority."
"Excited that I was finally going to stay at the Chicago Intercontinental storied hotel. Upon check in I was processed like a slab of beef and religated to the ""new"" tower. The ""new"" tower was a soviet era housing block glued onto the historical tower. The room - sub par. Threadbare towels, tiny space, a decor from the early 90s. The only good thing I can say about my experience is that I received a free cup of Starbucks. I travel to Chicago monthly and can say that this hotel has nothing on its Magnificent Mile counterparts.Avoid."
"I attended a conference at the Intercontinental and stayed in a 6th floor corner room. The room was clean, the bed was very comfortable and the conference room was gorgeous. I've got a thing about water pressure at hotels (because so often it is lacking) but the pressure here was great. The corner room offered nice views and plenty of light. Best of all was the location, which was central for the other meetings I had scheduled in Chicago. I did not eat at the Michael Jordan's Steakhouse on the first floor, but the bar was a nice cocktail venue after a long conference day. Also having a Starbucks in the lobby is always a plus. My only knocks would be (1) the room was very small, which wasn't a problem for me alone, but it would get cramped quickly with a family in tow, and (2) there are apparently sensors on the wine tray next to the TV that detect movement of product and automatically charge the room if anything is moved (I was erroneously charged for a bottle of wine, although they corrected my bill before checkout). I would stay again."
"From the doorman (Will), to the support for our international meeting (Moro), to housekeeping my experience was top shelf. Any visit to Chicago is enjoyable as far as I am concerned, but this was my first stay at the InterContinental. The location made for great dining and shopping as there were many near by. I took advantage of the in house bar and restaurant and found them to my liking indeed! The hotel is grand and full of wonderful architectural gems. Look forward to bringing my family there soon! Thanks for taking such good care of me."
"One of the most wonderful hotels we have ever experienced! The old side of the hotel has the most ornate conference accommodations imaginable! We were here for a leadership conference and nothing else in Chicago even came close for meeting rooms and in-house dinners! The rooms on the old side are full of charm and luxury. The rooms on the new side are modern and sleek. All the rooms pleased their occupants! If you stay here you MUST go to the indoor pool! You will be amazed! Their is a Starbucks in the lobby and a fantastic, though a bit pricey, breakfast buffet!Shopping is literally right outside the front door as you are right on the Magnificent Mile!!

"Checked in early afternoon. We were checked in by a trainee, but she was very pleasant and helpful. She did not yet know the layout of the hotel, so it took 3 tries to finally find a room away from the elevator. The room was spacious, clean and quiet. The breakfast buffet in the morning was pricey, but super! Not included in the room rate but it was extensive and delicious. The location is convenient to public transportation in the city."
Staying here for a conference. The hotel layout is odd because the rooms are divided between two towers. The hallway is nondescript. The meeting space and banquet areas have sweeping stairwells. It could be a nice setting for a wedding or a gala but a little odd for the conference. The staff is nice and expedient. The pool is an unexpectedly nice touch. Not my style but better and more interesting than other hotel pools. Location is convenient to shopping on Michigan and to the loop.
"This hotel is a one in a million. The rooms are clean & comfortable. As with other downtown hotels the rooms are small. The staff was friendly and helpful. The Michael Jordan rest. PRICEY! The InterContinental is located in the middle of everything. (walking distance to play, park, shopping and dining). We found a $99 dollar rate, while that is not the average if you look you can find great deals. DO IT! It is so worth the trip. If you like to swim there is a really nice pool on the 12th floor.Remember if you like to have a cocktail, it is a better idea to bring it with you and have cocktail hour in your room before you leave the room."
"While this hotel is in a great location, is very clean and well appointed, in the new tower section it has the worst layout of rooms I have ever seen. I don't normally care tremendously whether my hotel room is large or not as I don't usually spend a great deal of time awake in the room. But these rooms are a danger to your shins, knees, hips etc. as arrangement is so convoluted. The space between beds and furniture and walls is very narrow and there is no way to easily walk around. If you need to get up in the night be sure to turn on all the lights as otherwise you are very likely to bang against a furniture corner. The entry into the bathroom is offset so that the counter has to have a notch cut out to allow the door to open and when it does open, it can only do so 90 degrees which means as you enter, you need to navigate yourself around the countertop as well. I asked to be moved to another room figuring I had just gotten an odd weird room. I was told all the double rooms in that tower had the same contorted layout. I ended up paying an upgrade to switch to a room in the older ""classic"" section which was a very nice room.

"I would call it a four star but we maybe did not get the best room as we did a priceline. They probably count on the priceline wins not to complain because of the better deal they get and give them the less desirable rooms... should'nt be that way. Not like they were sold out. Room had very loud HVAC system. Something was probably wrong it also ran constantly but we were too tired by the time we got to bed to deal with it, I did turn it off completely a few hours before we got up. The carpet in the hallways was unbelievably worn. Otherwise the room was OK.

"This hotel was perfectly located for our woman's weekend trip to Chicago. We could walk to Navy Pier and to any shops that we chose to go to. Loved being on The Magnificent Mile. The room was spacious and clean, we stayed in the renovated tower. The staff at the front desk could not be more helpful and pleasant. The concierge desk staff was outstanding! My only complaint would be that I wish they would have had free wifi.

"The hotel overall was very nice. My room was quite small and could use some updates. But the location cannot be topped. I was able to walk to all of the major stores that I wanted to visit in between meetings at the convention I was attending. The America Girl Store was about a 10 minute walk and the big mall (Nordstrom, etc.) was directly across the street. There is a Starbucks right in the lobby, which was a HUGE bonus for me. Michael Jordan's restaurant is also located inside and was FABULOUS!!!! Our meeting space was adequate and the ballroom was great! The group was around 260 people, which fit perfectly. The stage and screen for the presentation was nice and large. There is also a second tier in the ballroom if you had a larger group and needed the additional space. The second tier offered a great view to the stage.

"My sister picked this hotel, but I was impressed by the condition and quality of the Intercontinental. From the reception and room service to house keeping and concierge, everyone was friendly amidst a not-always pleasant Chicago crowd. The hotel boasts several restaurants, including Michael Jordan's steakhouse plus an on-site Starbucks which my sisters were thrilled about. You can easily catch the red line subway about 4 blocks west of the property. The blue line is about a 3/4 mile walk which was easy to get to and from. I actually took the blue line from O'hare to Clark/Lake then walked to the hotel. While I didn't eat at the hotel, my sisters enjoyed their room service and the Starbucks like I mentioned. There is a Walgreens about a block and a half away which has amazing fresh juices and smoothies. There is also a terrific restaurant across the street called The Purple Pig. Back to the hotel...the rooms are adequate in size, maybe a little small with 2 full-sized beds but they are very comfy beds with cozy sheets and soft pillows. I hate when pillows are hard and my chin is on my chest! The bathroom was a great size, the water pressure was great and the toiletries were stocked daily. I love that the room had a mini fridge for drinks or leftovers which we had a couple of times. There is a lot of trendy shopping nearby plus eateries and Navy Pier is only 4 blocks east. Even getting to our segway tour was a breeze and only a mile away. There is a lot of nightlife (lounges, bars, clubs) nearby, so either walking or taking a short cab ride is a breeze. I do recommend staying in this hotel if you like the Magnificent Mile area."
So this hotel is not up to the usual intercontinental standard but in fairness it's working within the architecture of an old building. So you trade the usual comfort for the great location. Staff are friendly and while they acknowledge your Ambassador status as a club member there are no bells and whistles. The welcome letter said a choice of welcome amenity or points we were just given points. We would have chosen the amenity if we has been given a choice and no room upgrade. Despite being platinum ambassador members with a guaranteed room upgrade we only got the room we paid for. Well not exactly we got two standard adjoining rooms one with a long instead of the bed. So it wasn't a suite and with only a narrow adjoining door you don't use the second room as it isolates you from your companion. I have spent more than 100 nights in intercontinental properties worldwide. This one is very basic. We would not return to it on future visits and if it weren't for the location I would have scored it 2. The rooms are very disappointing when you compare it to the usual intercontinental standard
"Stayed at the Vice presidential suit, very spacious, very nice value but the hotel is too old and needs a lot of renovation, staff are friendly in general, their GM was standing in the lobby and greeting guests which is a nice gesture.Concierge staff are nice but I believe they need younger guys who are aware of the nice restaurants and activities.Was disappointed to know that there is no club lounge in the hotel.Location is great, walking distance from everywhere.I would frankly consider it more of a crown plaza than an intercon."
"Stayed here this past Saturday night with my husband and family. The hotel is beautiful and you can't beat the location!! The staff was extremely accommodating and very knowledgeable. This was my second stay in the last couple of months and this has become my favorite hotel in Chicago. Don't even get me started on Eno, how can you miss with amazing wine, cheese and chocolate? I wish I had more time to visit!!!"
"For whatever reason my first trip to Chicago ever was a mere two weeks ago, the occasion being a dear friend's wedding. I knew that the hotel had been chosen for a number of reasons, which the hotel delivered upon perfectly. The location was superb. The events of the wedding would all take place in one or another portion of the hotel. And finally, the hotel offered enough space for everyone to enjoy being close without being cramped. During my stay a number of events were happening at nearby Millennium Park, and the mix of tourists and interesting locals up and down Michigan Ave. made the atmosphere inviting and safe. The hotel itself is obviously a vintage piece of grand architecture, which allows for some leeway in terms of ultra-modern conveniences and fast emerging trends. Yet my room straddled a corner, offering multiple windows, and ample space for the king size bed, furniture, and great hallway toward the luxurious bath.My room was on a high floor, which would have allowed for the neighboring office tower to have a great view into my room- had it not been the weekend and everyone was at home. Perhaps this is normal for big city urban life; I just wonder if the windows are tinted on the outside for some degree of privacy. If not - se la vie. The hotel's views of Chicago's downtown skyline are AMAZING!As for the amenities, I was delighted that there was an ample sampling of shower gel, soaps and shampoos, all with a delightful fragrance. I took advantage of the complimentary shoe-shine service, which was a life saver. I didn't have to sit through it, simply sent the shoes and they came back sparkling. The lobby of the hotel features the world-class Michael Jordan restaurant which delivers on what it promises. A great vibe, good strong drinks at the bar and a hearty meal. Cheap, it is not.The only blip in the experience was the unfortunate ""business center.""A hotel of this size could surely spare a few actual usable computer terminals with seating and some privacy - much like a lower end property offers. This particular set up offered two or three computer monitors with pre-selected 'buttons' for the various airlines for which to print boarding passes. Unfortunately all three terminals froze up at the same time, leaving all my personal information (name, travel data, etc.) exposed on all the screens. One of the managers attempted to reboot the system but was unsuccessful. While this system was probably sold to the management as a great time-saving tool for busy travelers; most business travelers today are well aware how to navigate to what they need, and don't need a dumbed down system such as this. In short the hotel is a jewel in Chicago's crown with excellent service, clean and stylish fitment. The ballroom and other public areas were completely amazing with natural lights, huge windows and elegant chandeliers. This hotel is a great ambassador for a great city!

"I stayed at the Intercontinental Hotel as part of a conference. My room was in the new tower and the conference sessions were in the Historic Tower. The Hotel is right in the middle of the Miracle Mile shopping area and convenient to many shops and restaurants.The Historic Tower, which was built in the 1920's has incredible architecture. There are very nice spaces, half-floors, fountains and beautiful sculptures and tapestries. All breakfasts and lunches were catered as part of the conference and the food was excellent. My room was clean, quiet and very comfortable. Everything in the room worked well. I do have one minor complaint. There was not much in the room as far as the list of amenities so I didn't know there was a safe in the room until I was checking around to make sure I didn't leave anything behind just before checking out.

"We couldn't have picked a better spot to vacation in Chicago. We were in walking distance to great shopping, restaurants and attractions.Also, we had a health emergency and could walk to North Western Hospital.Our room was quite large with fantastic soft sheets.The pool was huge, but could have been warmer.Michael Jordan's restaurant located in the lobby was delightful too.We would definitely book this hotel again."
"I stayed here for two nights in order to go to a concert at Soldier field. The location from Soldier field was great, it was about a 40 minute walk but easily found. There are many great stores and food chains all on the same street as the hotel. The staff were very friendly and willing to take and/or hold your bags even after you were checked out of the hotel room for the weekend. Over all the hotel was clean, friendly, beautiful, and in a great central location. I highly recommend staying here."
"Everything about our trip was made better by staying at the InterContinental. When we arrived our car was met by a friendly and efficient individual who answered our questions and quickly unloaded our luggage. Our bellman, vince was outstanding. He quickly brought our luggage up and welcomed us to the hotel. He answered all our questions and gave many valuable suggestions as to where to eat anfd visit. When we returned to our hotel that evening he had brought up a bottle of wine and two glasses in honor of our 50th anniversary. By the endo fo our stay we felt like we had a new friend.I would highly recommend the hotel as its location is perfect and all of the people with whom we interacted were friendly and efficient."
"I just returned from a weekend with my sister in Chicago, staying at the InterContinental for the first time. Check-in was friendly and efficient and while my sister was going through that process I was asking concierge Bob a number of questions. He was beyond friendly and made me feel like an old friend. Upon arriving at our room we found we were short several towels and within 10 minutes of calling housekeeping we had more towels. I also called room service since we arrived late in the evening, and again, in well less than the 30 minutes we were told it would be, our food arrived and it was delicious. Everyone we encountered at the hotel was friendly, responsive and helpful. The room itself was a bit small, but we were not there much and the space in the bathroom made up for it. Upon arriving home today I realized I'd left behind a pair of glasses and called the hotel. The gentleman I spoke to (whose name I did not get) said he'd go check the room himself and call me right back. Within 15 minutes I was notified my glasses were found and would be sent back UPS. I consider their customer service and response time excellent and would stay at this property again in a heartbeat....and in fact hope to!"
"This is the third visit with my granddaughter to Chicago and there is nowhere we would rather stay than at the Intercontinental. Jessica Olden of Guest Services sees to it that our stay is memorable. To the upgrade to a gorgeous corner room, amenities too numerous to mention and the treat of the hotel's magnificent breakfast buffet, we were treated superbly and kindly. Doorman Clive was ALWAYS available to hail a cab or give directions. Thank you Jessica for everything. I hope your employer knows what a gem he has in you. My granddaughter is still smiling!"
"I was there for three nights. At one point I decided to go back to my room to take a nap and pressed the ""do not disturb"" button on the door. I was first woken up by the phone ringing. I didn't answer it. Then there was subsequent knocking on the door and someone loudly yelling ""housekeeping."" As I had clearly marked my room ""do not disturb,"" I did not see the need to get up. The knocking finally stopped and the phone started ringing again. I picked up and was greeted by the housekeeper asking if I needed any services.""If a guess makes it clear that they do not wish to be disturbed, that option should be respected."
"If you are looking for a luxurious new hotel with large rooms this may not be the place for you. It is an older hotel that has been updated the best it can for the age of the hotel. For the price you can find a nicer more luxurious room, but you can't beat the location. This hotel is within walking distance of most all shopping, theater or dining experiences you could want. Just north of the river on Michigan Avenue. The staff was friendly and went out of there way to accommodate us. We requested an early check in and we were given that without a problem. Bus stops outside of this location will take you to museums, parks and further reaching destinations for only a couple bucks.

"Customer service was beyond excellent even as soon as we checked in with Malcolm at the front desk. Concierge provided great insight about the city as well as restaurants. Appreciate Michelle Slaw recommending her favorite Italian restaurant and even making the reservation for us! Great location on Magnificent Mile. So close to everything. Rooms were small though and needs to be updated soon, would stay here again!"
"We stayed at this property for two nights with our family (2 adults, 2 small children). Our room was not ready at 2 pm, but was promised for 3. We left our bags with the bellman and valet parked our car ($$$$$$!!!!!). We were told that they would call us as soon as our room was ready, but we never received a call! Luckily, by the time we returned it was ready.This property is in a great location on Michigan Ave- a few blocks from Navy Pier and the river. Not much of a view from our room. The room was clean and comfortable, if a bit small. The hotel was very busy- looked to be 2 or 3 weddings going on the day we arrived."
"Location is great right on Michigan Avenue with all the stores and great restaurants. Close to River North cultural section and its a short walk to the lake front. Staff is very service oriented and friendly, quick to handle requests and good with directions or advice if needed from the Concierge. CLEAN is #1 in my book and this hotel is great keeping the house in order and fresh. Nice to have all the activities and conventions going on and they're right in the middle of it for me. You must stay here. If you're looking for assistance in multiple bookings, events or coordination help, Dana Solomon is the Director of Business Travel and she will get it done. Huge resource to tap into.

"The motel was awesome- clean the beds are amazingly comfortable. I can't say enough though about the concierge Bob that works there.Every question we had for him he had an answer for, he recommended a restaurant for breakfast then gave us his card which allowed us to skip the wait and be seated right away. He informed us of all the ways to best venture around the city and made our vacation such an enjoyable one. The entire staff were accommodating and the best part is the location of this hotel right in the Centre of all the action on magnificent mile. Would stay again in a heartbeat."
"The location in River North on Michigan Ave was excellent. Easy access to taxis. Many fine restaurants and bars in the area, plus great shopping and a Walgreens across the street. Classic hotel with semi-updated feel. We were celebrating our engagement and wedding venue shopping. We have pet allergies and the hotel upgraded us to a hypo-allergenic room. The room was fine though the shower leaked all over the floor and the bathroom needs updating.Despite putting both ""Do Not Disturbs"" on the door (light and the sign), housekeeping walked-in on us while indisposed. Management said it would never happen again. Housekeeping did it again the next day. Even though we were having a romantic getaway, a huge family in multiple rooms were put next to us. Their children we slamming doors and running in hall at 3am. We called security but it continued for over an hour.We reported all problems with our stay to the management and they offered to compensate us saying, ""We're a better hotel then this and give us a chance to prove it."" Two weeks passed and no compensation. Told it should have come, it's coming soon, be patient as they'd follow up and get back to me the next day. They never follow up so I do. Told two more weeks and nothing. Another call to management and two more weeks til they finally say it's been sent. Two months of chasing the hotel down to make good on their offer to compensate me for a very poor stay before receiving anything. Staff is friendly and offers good service though I wish the execution matched the intention. We'll see if things are better on our next stay.


Room Tip: Request a room away from the elevator.

"We came back after a great experiance last winter where I reviewed it with 5 stars. This stay was dismal. The staff was exceptionally rude and the rooms were really dirty! It's a 3 star try to advertise as a 5 star...including its price. We stayed one night and paid $250, no including taxes and fees, and they wanted me to pay them an extra $15 to use the internet for 5 minutes! Seriously? Watch out for extras added onto your bill. Wont be returning."
"Had a very nice, quiet corner room for our stay this past weekend. Fantastic water pressure in the bathrooms, but the shower faucet was strange. Very hard to turn on, it clicked to move instead of just turning it, it took me like 5 minutes to figure it out because I kept thinking I was going to accidentally break it. We paid for the hotel on Priceline and when we checked in they took a credit card for incidentals. Totally fine, except they put a $125 hold on the card. So weird, I've never seen a hotel do that before. Maybe because it was Lollapalooza weekend and people tend to trash rooms? In any case, great location for the festival - about a 10-15 minute to the park. And great location for shopping and restaurants. Very nice stay overall."
"This hotel is located in walking distance of many attractions and close enough to the train and bus routes to get you everywhere! Rooms are well-appointed and service is great. If you go, ask them to tell you how to see the pool on the historic side of the building. It is magnificent and just an elevator ride away.


Room Tip: Try for a room on the top floor as the nighttime traffic noise can be loud.

"We spent four days at the InterContinental on the Magnificent Mile. We had a large king size room on floor 19 overlooking N. Michigan Ave. The staff, especially the concierge desk, were so helpful.It is close to the Red Line, which goes right to Wrigley Field and a short walk to many river cruises or Navy Pier. There are several restaurants close by that work for families: West Egg, Howell & Hood, Heaven on Seven, Grand Lux, and a short walk to Pizzeria Uno (or Pizzeria Due). Our sons are teens and picky eaters, so these places worked well because of the large menus.I would highly recommend this hotel. Be sure to check out the unique pool area even if you don't want to swim. It was built in the 1920s and is so elegant."
"This is the second time we have stayed at this property, both for special events when the city was full of people, and they got it completely right. Rooms are comfortable and clean. The beds are great and the location of the property is beautiful. Elijah at the front desk served us again this year. What a great first impression of the property. He is so professional and helpful. Clive on the front door helped us on our last day and made a wonderful last impression."
"This property is in the middle of paradise. The Magnificent Mile is like being in NYC only it is cleaner and probably safer (even the few street people looked presentable!). This is really a nice hotel. The rooms are a little on the smallish side. We were there for a wedding so we got to see multiple rooms. The Michael Jordon restaurant is good for a cocktail or a bite to eat. The front desk was not to cooperative/approachable over a legitimate room problem (AC not working properly, dirty windows). However we worked it out. Kathy the head concierge was great, most helpful and pleasant. A little better on the management side would make this a 5 star experience.


Room Tip: Work the front desk to make sure you have a good room. Some are OK at best; some really nice.

"I recently stayed 5 nights at The InterContinental Chicago on Michigan Avenue. The location is top notch. I walked absolutely everywhere from this hotel. I had a room in the newer tower which was very modern, clean and comfortable. I would not hesitate to recommend this hotel as your base for seeing the great city of Chicago.

"Former Chicago residents, we had stayed at this hotel before. This time we arrived as a family - two small girls in tow. The gorgeous architecture that is nearing a century still remained as pristine as it has always been. But traveling with children gave us a new prespective.At check in, the concierge brought tiaras to our girls. We were upgraded to a king suite, for free. The room was the size of a substantial apartment, with two full baths (separate tub and shower, all marble). Our request too have the sofa bed turned down (we checked in shortly before 9 pm) was so quickly completed that the maid was nearly done when we got to the room. The room and bedding were luxurious. The hotel has removed what used to be the restaurant and exchanged it for a Starbucks, putting great coffee on-site. There is a steakhouse and bar on location. The pool is, well, elegant and beautiful, a reminder of a decadent and by-gone era. From the valet to the front desk to the room cleaning services, the well-trained and happy to accomodate staff exemplified perfection in service.


Room Tip: Ask for the historic tower, and walk the first 6 fights.

"Stayed here with our friends and kids and had a lovely time. Location can't be beat as it's the only hotel right on the Mag Mile, which made it easy to pop in during the day. Our room had a great view and they have metal cribs for young kids. Do the self guided tour if you have some time ... you get a good behind the scenes look at the history of the property. There's additional costs for a fridge in the room, access to the gym and wifi but taking a dip in the pool is free! Sign up for the membership program and you'll get free WiFi! We had a double stroller and it went everywhere easily and had plenty of space in the room as well. Ask for the historic wing if you want more space, new wing is modern but smaller rooms. I hear there's upgrades being made to the historic wing soon."
"Booked the Intercontinental through an Expedia package deal for a long 4th of July Weekend with wife and 7 year old son. As everyone says, the location is in the center of everything and there isn't a more conveniently located hotel in the entire city. This is a VERY large hotel and the lobby was always extremely busy. I agree with the other poster who said there were few places to sit and relax. I tend to like hotels with homey lobbies and a nice cocktail lounge within but this is much more akin to a convention hotel. It was an absolute zoo all weekend, and if there is a lobby bar, other than the one in the adjacent Michael Jordan's Steak House, I didn't notice it. Still, we had a pleasant experience. We arrived very early (11:30AM) and fully expected to just drop off our bags with the bellman and do touristy things before checking in later in the afternoon but were pleasantly surprised when we were told rooms were available and could check in right then. I booked a double, not realizing that in hotel parlance, double means two full size beds, and apparently not two queen size beds so that was mildly disappointing. I won't make that same mistake again, but other than that, the room was fine so I didn't want to press the issue. The Bedding was very comfortable and the Bathroom had a luxurious marble vanity with substantial counter space and a wall size mirror. Compared to the vanity, the shower / tub was a bit of a letdown but perfectly functional. The bath products were definitely good enough to snag a few for the dopp kit as I'm a sucker for good hotel toiletries. The pool on the 14th floor was beautiful and a unique blast from the past. Our interactions with the hotel staff were limited to check in and we never utilized the concierge simply because we have several local friends and were pretty booked with them all weekend. I can't fault the hotel for charging for wireless as most big city hotels do, but I've never heard of a charge to use the fitness center, which they do charge for it here. That was a bit of a surprise. All in all though, we had a good experience and would stay there again under similar circumstances Is it a 4 star property? Not in my opinion, but I never expected it to be and thought it was still a pretty good value."
"As an InterContinental member, my experience might be a bit different but the location is still great :)Staff are very friendly and helpful and the rooms are very nice. I enjoyed my stay very much.If you're not a member, do take into account that the Gym (with a semi-Olympic pool) has an additional charge as well as Internet access (based on your room and package).The Gym is well equipped allowing a full workout and the pool is simply amazing."
"We love Chicago. We flew Porter to Midway Airport, closer to the city. Cab fare is not too bad between $20-$30. You can take buses or subway for less. We wanted to stay on the Magnificent Mile and that location is just great, close to the river and a view of the river from our room. The hotel is quite nice and busy with a digital wall view of the street behind the front desk. We had a drink in Michael Jordans on the first floor but did not eat there. The room was great and the bed very comfortable. The service is always good even though a little impersonal but it is a large hotel. We enjoyed our stay thoroughly."
"I loved everything about it!!! Will and the other valet guy were very friendly and had great recommendations, keyon and Jennifer @ the front desk were very accommodating! And jose c. Was a great and very friendly bell hop! He sent us to a great breakfast place! When we got in the first night the little one wasn't going to sleep so polo(the head security guy) took us on a short little history tour and was so knowledgable about the hotels history! I was so impressed! The fed ex guys were also great too!! But the recommendation that we got was for a breakfast place from them was terrible! It wasn't their fault! We based it on the review from yelp that they looked up for us! That place was soo rude lol So I just wanna say thank your for all the help everyone I named in this! You guys were amazing! It's close to old town too which is a must see!!!"
"This hotel is just kind of in the middle of everything! On the magnificent mile within walking distance to many attractions. Stayed in the new tower with newly decorated rooms, very nice. Was much quieter than I expected being right on Michigan Ave. on the 21st floor wasn't bothered with street noise. Staff was always friendly. You have to go see the pool room! It's beautiful in the grand tower."
"Had a family reunion of sorts in Chicago and most of us stayed here. All the staff we encountered were friendly and helpful, especially Mirsaola at the front desk. The location of the hotel is perfect if you are looking to be in the heart of downtown Chicago, specifically in the shopping district. The hotel itself was clean and upscale, however, I am sure you could find higher end options if you're looking for over the top luxury. The rooms were updated and I would rate them average for a hotel of this quality. Very comfortable and a nice place to stay. We too had a ""deal"", as it seems many have found via Priceline or Hotwire, so I think we got a lot of value for what we paid. We would stay there again."
"The InterContinental is a very nice hotel and provides a cool mix of old style luxury (large, beautifully tiled pool, a 'historic tower') while still providing clean, up-to-date rooms with modern amenities. The staff are quite friendly, generally speaking, and do their best to offer personal attention. That said, the hotel itself is enormous - so you certainly won't have 'that personal' touch of a smaller boutique hotel and check-in/check-out lines can be quite long.The gym is great (two floors, cardio/weights) and the pool is incredible (full lap pool, luxurious decorated), but the $12 usage fee is a bit insulting. On that note, keep in mind that like most high-end, large hotels in the neighborhood, fees for additional amenities are outrageous (be prepared to pay $5 for a Coke in the minibar, $20 for some eggs in room service).The location is great - right in the heart of the Magnifiscent Mile and an easy walk to downtown attractions - though a bit far from an 'L' stop."
"Hotel is in an excellent location for shopping and a very short distance from the Navy Pier and beach front. I stayed in the historic tower. The room was large and has everything you need to get a good nights rest. However, it is dark and lacks the wow factory that I've grown to love in boutique hotels. For business travelers the rooms lacks a wired connection to the internet, so you will have to rely on the hotels wireless options. The pool and weight room are nice. The hotel does a good job with room service. I wish the restaurant downstairs provided breakfast. Lastly the front lobby wreaks of cheap mens' aftershave."
"I booked through Priceline, so I called ahead to request a room in the historic tower. The reservations dept was very friendly and helpful and made note of my request. Upon arriving, I was given a choice between three rooms and chose a 25th floor historic tower room. The view was excellent, looking south toward the Tribune Tower, Wrigley Building and the Chicago River. The room was small but cozy and the bathroom was nice. We could hear some of the traffic and sirens from the street but it never kept us up at night. The beds were very comfortable. Being an IHG club member (free to join), we got free wifi and two coupons for free Starbucks drinks in the lobby. GREAT location right on Michigan Ave and walkable to just about everything. Very friendly and courteous staff. The hotel is older and shows age in carpet and some decor, but we were overall very pleased and would be happy to return."
"Stayed here for a work function I would definitely stay again if I'm ever in Chicago again. The staff was so friendly and very accommodating. The rooms were spacious with comfy beds and pillows, rainfall shower head was a nice surprise. I stayed on the 19th floor and had an amazing view of the Wrigley building. ENO wine bar off the lobby was great fun we each ordered a wine flight and a chocolate tasting and prices were very reasonable. Did not try Michael Jordan's steakhouse but several of my coworkers did and raved about the food. Great location shopping, food and bars steps away."
"The location is the only better than expected attribute. The hotel insists on nickel and diming it's customers. It's a rude surprise when a hotel still charges for internet. It's even sadder; when they charge for use of the gym. The GYM!! Oh but it's a huge gym with great equipment, no, it's a few ellipticals and treadmills. If these amenities are not of interest, then it's recommendable lodging."
"My recent stay at the Intercontinental Chicago was comfortable and highly convenient. However, it was pleasantly punctuated at the very end by Will, The Doorman's, smiling and helpful service. As I was rushing off to catch a cab to the convention, I realized I had no cash to spare, but instead of responding angrily, Will simply smiled and asked me to enjoy my day. There are not many people left in this world that can turn an embarrassing situation into warm and friendly service. This is what hospitality is all about!"
"I recently stayed at the Intercontinental Chicago for a week on a business trip (with a fun weekend afterwards). The hotel basically has multiple-personality disorder, and the staff needs a lot of work.The hotel has two towers - the historic tower, and the new tower. The historic tower has larger rooms with older furnishings and obviously need a refresh. The newer tower was given a superficial face lift (lots of wallpaper, rugs, etc) - often referred to in the industry as ""soft goods"" and it's obvious that they did it as fast as they could - the work is pretty sloppy.The cleaning staff needs some major training. I had colleagues whose rooms were never cleaned during their stay. My room got serviced daily, however the cleaning wasn't very good. I dropped a fingernail on the rug, and kept tabs on it during the week. Something tells me the next guest got to look at it too.When I arrived in my room, I found the shower light flickering. I ended up calling the hotel to ask them to change the bulb, because the cleaning staff obviously never bothered to mention it to anyone. Also, it's worth noting - it's not like the bulb started flickering that day - the fixture had two bulbs, one was completely out, and the other flickered for 2 days before I decided to call to have it changed myself.My room was adjoining on two sides, which is something I've never seen before, and the doors aren't well sealed, so I'd recommend NOT getting an adjoining room if they're available. I heard one group ordering room service at 11pm, and the other having sex at 9pm.Finally, check-out on Sunday was a NIGHTMARE. My friend who was traveling with me was waiting on line for 10 minutes without it moving (about 20+ people long), so I told her there was a phone extension you could call and just check out that way, which she promptly did.This hotel all-in-all isn't bad, but I think they could use a management overhaul, and need some serious training through the ranks.

"This is a very, very, very old hotel. I'm sure there have been plenty of renovations done, but my lasting impression is that this is a very, very, very old hotel. There was a weird elevator situation, where certain elevators only went to certain floors. I think that helped with the wait time, but was confusing at first. The room itself was clean - small, but clean. Join their free rewards club - it gives you free wifi and a later checkout, which was nice. Also, they advertise their fitness center, but don't tell you that it will cost you $12/day. Be prepared for that. Great location. Very, very, very old hotel."
"Visitors to Chicago are spoiled with great hotel options and although the InterContinental isn't the Peninsula or the Four Seasons, it's a great option if you want to stay on Michigan Avenue at a somewhat lower price point. The recent room renovation successfully produced a great 4-star plus product and the addition of Michael Jordan's Steakhouse added a great upscale dining alternative for hotel guests. The staff is very accommodative, and I have found that InterContinental Ambassadors are well taken care of at this property. A great choice on Michigan Avenue."
"I checked into the hotel for my honeymoon on May 9th and stayed over the weekend. I wanted to stay at a nice place so I could enjoy my honeymoon. There was a wedding party DIRECTLY beneath me (I was in room 905) all night and my floors were BOUNCING I couldn't sleep at all. I wasn't even going to complain because that just isn't in my nature but now when I checked out they assured me I had no extra charges but now I am seeing a $125 charge pending on my credit card (two days after the clerk assured me I had no charges on checkout). It was a nice room and great location but I could have paid 1/10 the price somewhere else. I chose this hotel because I MISTAKENLY assumed they would be able to provide a quiet atmosphere. Save your money and go to Holiday Inn or Motel 7. At least they won't tack on ridiculous charges. I'll most likely be spending the rest of the day trying to figure out what they are charging me for.


Room Tip: Don't go anywhere near the ninth floor it's right above the ballroom.

"Excellent location, rooms were clean and mattresses/bedding -outstanding! Front desk staff was just okay-courteous but not overly helpful or friendly. (This was all shifts). No warm welcomes here -'just the facts ma'am'- underwhelming service. Time for a shot of enthusiasm!

"In a competitive market it's not awful, just not good enough. I don't know whether wifi was included or not and the landing page didn't detail pricing. The view from my room - and I am a Rewards Club member - was literally of the metal-clad air shaft. The shower tap was broken such that only scalding water was available - which must have been obvious to housekeeping who presumably (hopefully!) need to turn on the water to clean the bath. On mentioning this at check-out, no apology, just a comment that they would get maintenance to look at it. I hope so, but that helps me how? The bar is a Michael Jordan's and while the service was good, I have literally not seen a menu with so much beef on it: even the salads have beef strips. I know that is the point and great if you love steak, but it's surprising to have so few options in a large hotel. The room itself was comfortable so big picture no complaints, but compared to my last Intercontinental (Paris) this felt like the last year of a Sheraton property Starwood is sweating till it's reborn as a W. Ironically, colleagues were at the Sheraton - supposedly a ""lesser"" hotel - and the public areas I saw were great.

"Stayed 4/29/14-4/30/14. I booked this hotel as a girls night away to celebrate my birthday(turned 20). I requested a room on a high floor and with a view. Upon arrival, the friendly and very nice valet came over to the car. I wish I could remember his name. He helped us with our bags and assured us our vehicle would be taken care of. We went in at about 10:30am to see if the room was by chance ready, and it was. We got the keys and off we were to the room. My room was on the 24th floor and had a view. I was delighted that my request was actually followed through. No free wifi here. ): We scoped out the room and took plenty of pictures. Fell in love with the bathroom and how spacious the room was. We were so happy that the beds were nice and soft unlike most hotel beds that are stiff and just about break your back. As someone with back issues I couldn't have been happier. We then unpacked a bit got our purses and went to see the historic lap pool. This is one of the reasons I chose this hotel. We took the hallway there, signed in and up we went to the pool. Its more beautiful than it is in the pictures! It was so relaxing in there. We snapped a few photos and then left to go shopping. We returned at about 5 and had brought back pizza with us. Upon entering our room we tried to put the pizza away. The mini fridge is quite mini lol. We took the items from the fridge to fit in the pizza just to find they wouldn't fit. We put everything back in the fully stocked mini bar we had in our fridge that had been taken out. While getting ready to go off for a swim I was reading the info brochure and found out anything removed from the fridge for more than 30 seconds is electronically charged to your room. We finished getting ready and went down to the front desk. I explained what happened to the manager and she removed the charges and reset the fridge. I asked her what we could do with our pizza. Right away she was on the phone searching for a fridge for us. She then told us if none were available we could store the pizza in room services refrigerator. We headed to the pool. You have to sign in again and rinse before swimming. We went into the locker/shower area and oh my was it wonderful in there! So spacious and clean! The shampoo/conditioner/body wash/lotion its all right there. There was even a machine to wash your swimsuit while you showered, how cool is that! There is a large locker room and sauna. Sauna is free and lovely. You then walk through the fitness center which has a fee to use and up the stairs to the pool. We chose our chairs and in we went. The water was just right and they have heaters on in the pool area so it was very nice in there. The room and atmosphere was so calming. Only thing missing is a hot tub. From there we went back to the room to wind down. Watched tv and enjoyed the view. It was a very quiet night and comfortable beds. No trouble sleeping. In the morning we got up and started to get ready. The shower heads have a rain effect which was wonderful. We packed our bags and headed to check out. We then had our bags checked as we were not yet leaving. The staff put our pizza in the room service fridge and our bags in the vault. We were given our tickets to claim them and went out for the day. We returned about 3 to pick up the bags and our car. The staff was friendly fast and so kind! All of our bags were brought to us as well as the pizzas. We then went to get the car and it was ready for us to go. I will be returning to this hotel I absolutely loved it. I want to thank the staff for helping me to enjoy my birthday and maki ng our stay a remarkable one! Thank you thank you thank you!! :)"
"This was my first trip to Chicago in many years. We decided to stay at the Intercontinental because of its location downtown. It turned out to be a great choice. The staff was very friendly and helpful. One of the bell men, Jose R., made a good trip great. His recommendations for restaurants were awesome. Jose also helped with transportation local points of interest. The hotel was clean with good amenities. The wifi was fast and reliable. Based on the level of service and amenities, I will stay at the Intercontinental again when visiting Chicago."
"I went to Chicago to see my boyfriend we ended up at this hotel per a hotel deal ... I was so happy !! I bathroom had the best smelling shampoo, soap, body wash & conditioner I have ever smelled ... Room was spotless( we were in older tower ) big room for a Chicago hotel .. Everyone was nice !! Sheets were crisp white and clean ... Now comes my ONLY complaint ... I am handicapp and they have the best pool ever , but if my boyfriend had not been with my I would have been stuck in pool as there is no access for handicapp people .. This is sad I understand it's historical but somehow someone should come up w/ a way to get in and out for people w/ disabilities ... I had. Hard time getting in but worse getting out .. And this is not the first hotel in Chicago I have had a problem with ... Hope someday you can fix this , because this is a amazing hotel .... If you have no disabilities it's a dream pool !!!"
"My extended family and I just enjoyed a long weekend at the InterContinental for a family wedding. For the most part, we had an excellent experience. When we checked in, the front desk manager could not have been more helpful with our somewhat complicated reservations. He went above and beyond to accommodate our needs. Our rooms in the beautiful Historic Tower were very nice. One problem though.....they do not have dressers or other drawer storage. When we complained, the staff found a small dresser and brought it to the room. A minor issue is the mediocre lighting and lack of a make-up mirror. Other family members stayed in the other tower and said the rooms were much smaller. We did consistently have problems reached customer service. The wait to speak to a person were long. Once, I just gave up and went down to the front desk.Both the ballroom and the pool are outstandingly beautiful.Be sure to bring take a look, even if you aren't attending a special event or swimming.We had breakfasts at the Starbucks in the lobby (which was just like every other Starbucks) and in the hotel restaurant (which was good but expensive). We had drinks at Michael Jordan's Steakhouse (also in the lobby), which was busy but fine.


Room Tip: The rooms in the Historic Tower are larger.

"We booked our room through Hotwire and got a great deal for two nights. This is perhaps my favorite hotel on the Magnificent Mile. It is in the perfect location if you like being able to easily shop both North Michigan Ave or the South State St shopping area, walk to Navy Pier, or Grant Park and Museums.Reminder: If you are a IHG (Intercontinental Hotel Group) Rewards Member, don't forget to give them your membership number even if you book the room through a discount seller. You won't get the points but you will get the member benefits such as Free Wi-Fi, a cup of coffee at the local Starbucks and late checkout.When we arrived we were warmly greeted and quickly checked-in at the front desk. We were given a large corner room on the 19th floor that overlooked Michigan Avenue. (Hint: always politely ask the front desk person for a really nice room and they will usually accomodate you if one is available so don't be affraid to ask.) The room was larger than most Chicago Hotel rooms, clean, nicely furnished, had windows that could be opened, and very comfortable beds and pillows. Overall, a very pleasant stay with great service at a great location. I'll definitely be back!"
"We had a magnificent stay! The property is strategically located within walking distance from fabulous shops and suberb eating/drinking establishments. Our room in the historic tower was spacious and comfortable and had a great view! The staff was congenial and accommodating. In particular the bellman, ""Clive,"" made us feel welcome and appreciated. We will definitely return to the Intercontinental Magnificent...

"This hotel is extremely well located - across the street (Michigan Ave) from a Nordstrom's that anchors a large shopping center. The staff was very helpful and our room was comfortable and very clean.One thing I really liked is the daybed/sofa that was built in under the window - much better arrangement than the normal two chairs. Electrical plugs were plentiful and the only thing I wish I could have had (but didn't ask for it) would have been a small refrigerator in the room. The prices in the hotel dining rooms were high, but not unexpected for a very nice hotel on the Million Dollar Mile."
"Stayed here for two nights while visiting Chicago. Check in was easy and we were pleasantly surprised by the gorgeous view in our ""standard"" corner room on the 24th floor. The room was quite large and the furnishings were nice. The bathroom was very spacious as well. The curtains were wonderful for blocking out the morning sun if you want to sleep in. The bed was very comfortable and inside our room we could not hear any noise which was very nice. I really enjoyed the complimentary newspaper outside our door the first morning. All of the concierges were so helpful and friendly as were the front desk staff and the doormen. Loved the ENO wine bar and all of the flights they offered. The location of this hotel cannot be beat! You can walk everywhere and taxis are always outside if needed. I was very happy there was a Starbucks attached to the hotel. We will definitely stay here again and hope to be back soon!"
"In terms of location, you just can't get better than this. If you walk out the hotel, you're at the Magnificent Mille, absolutely walking distance from anything you need in Chicago.I'm a little disapointed on the concierge, though. I stayed at this hotel for a few days, while waiting to move into my new apartment nearby. I had just arrived at the city, and asked for suggestions on what I should see. They did provide some tips, but never mentioned that the hotel itself is a landmark. As I actually only booked it for location, I had no idea of the interesting things I could see at the hotel. Only found out after checking out. There should be a pamphlet or something upon check-in.Other than that,very comfortable beds, fair pricing, good strong hot water in the bathrooms. Never tried the breakfast at the hotel, but they do have a starbucks right at the lobby."
"Stayed here the night before a race and was pleasantly surprised with how comfortable the beds were! I was happy to fall asleep in a soft bed, with a variety of pillow densities to choose from. Such a relief! The bathroom was a little cramped in the doorway, but other than that, the toiletries they supplied worked well and the bathroom itself was very clean. The only thing that made me a little uneasy, was the shower handle to turn on the water: It was very difficult to move it, to the point I was concerned I was going to break it or I was just completely doing it wrong. It felt like there was a really tight gasket on it. Water pressure isn't very strong, but it's a nice waterfall type shower head. So awesome that they had an iHome iPod dock for the newest version of Apple technology. My iPod was dead and I had forgotten my charger...well fear not, they have a charger for it on the clock/radio system provided. How awesome! It worked great too!They have a mini-bar in the room, but it was a little over-priced in my opinion so I didn't take the bait on that. It's a computerized system so when you remove it, it automatically charges it to your room. It also offered snacks, such as Pringles, Mars Co. candy bars, fruit snacks, chocolate covered almonds, cashews, and crunchy snack mixes.Overnight parking was $65, which is added into the authorization fee at the beginning of your stay. Use a credit card, never a debit card because the deauthorization may take up to seven days for a debit card to return back. Overall, wonderful hotel! I would stay here again, it was nice to be in the middle of everything. Very close to restaurants and stores. Perfect! There is also a HUGE StarBucks downstairs, connected to the lobby as well as Michael Jordan's Steakhouse.

"We recently stayed at the InterContinental for a business trip which extended into the weekend. From the front desk staff to the doormen who secured cabs for us in the snow, everyone at the hotel was friendly and clearly there to assist their guests. The view of Michigan Avenue from the room was delightful and we always had our beds turned down with chocolates and a filled ice bucket when we came back from our day's activities. We will definitely return when in Chicago.


Room Tip: Pick a room in the historic tower--and wander around to see this grand hotel.

"Just spent 5 nights in this hotel in Chicago and really enjoyed my stay.First of all the location is just perfect!! Right on Magnificent Mile, it is central located and you can walk to most majors attractions the city has to offer.Service was good, continental breakfast was included and offered a big variety of food and fresh fruits.But the highlight here is the building itself. The historic tower, or ""south tower was built in 1929 and most of it remains unchanged today. Make sure you visit stunning pool, at its time one of the hights indoor pool in the world and the largest hotel pool in the city! Absolutely stunning!Have a look around the different ballrooms and king's Arthur court. (The elegant Grand Ballroom, a two-story, 100-foot (30 m) elliptical space, was decorated with ornaments in Egyptian, Assyrian, and Greek styles and was surrounded by a horseshoe-shaped mezzanine. In its center hung a 12,000-pound Baccarat crystal chandelier, the largest in North America )The hotel was renovated in 1990 but is honestly in great conditions and not aging much. Rooms are clean and well maintained and they were smart enough to keep as much as possible of the original building."
"This is a great hotel on the Mag Mile. The location near the Tribune Building is well placed and makes the hotel easy to find. It is also within walking distance of a plethora of restaurants. The lobby area was nice and welcoming. The check-in process was quite efficient as Margaret processed me very quickly and very pleasantly. There were apparently two towers. I was on the top floor (26) of the shorter tower and was able to get upgraded to a suite because of my IHG status. The room was terrific and the view was superb. It was clean, very spacious and the WiFi worked well the entire week I was there. My floor was very quiet as it was free of both street noise and neighbor noise. The bed was comfortable allowing me to get a good night's sleep each night I was there. The breakfast in the Continental room was excellent. The selection was great and the made-to-order omelet service was particularly wonderful. The Starbucks in the lobby was also a great feature. The check out was very quick and allowed me to get on my way. The room rate was fair and commensurate with the high-quality product they offer at this property. Overall, if you want a nice place on the Mag Mile, this is a great choice."
"I stayed here for 5 nights for a conference at McCormick Place. Overall, this is a very good hotel. The hotel is located on Magnificent Mile so there are a lot of very good restaurants within a 15 - 30 min walk even in snowy weather. I like the fact that it is a historic hotel; the swimming pool on the 12th floor (go for a swim, or at least look at it!) shows this. I would not mind staying here again. However, the lobby needs attention; I agree with one reviewer that the lobby looks a bit like a bar. I arrived here on a Saturday when there was a big game. It looked like there were people selling T-shirts on the lobby that my heart sank a little bit.Location: very good location on the Magnificent Mile. It's less than 10 min by cab from Union Station. There are several very good restaurants within a 15-30 min walk even with snowy sidewalks! Eataly, the Purple Pig are easy walks.Check in: check-in was quick. I arrived around noon and was given a room even if the check-in time is 3 pm. The staff is friendly, courteous and helpful.Room: I was on the 26th floor in the modern tower. The bed was comfortable and the bath amenities were ample with a few extras like make-up wipes. Slippers and bathrobe were provided. I am very sensitive to noises but I slept well as it was quiet. The in-room safe was also a nice amenity to have. I would have preferred a small fridge and no mini bar just to have more space in the fridge for my own. The hotel is in a nice enough location that one can go out and purchase drinks or food for late-night snacks. My rates came with free in-room wi-fi but this is NOT always the case.Service: I opted not to have my room cleaned or linens changed every day. When I did call for the service, it was done by the time I got back.Breakfast: My rates came with breakfast at The Continental on the 2nd floor. The buffet was amazing with a lot of good, fresh fruit and several dishes from the hot selection.I had a pleasant stay at this hotel and I am happy to recommend it to anyone.

"In town for the NRA restaurant show and stayed at the Palmer House. Picture perfect hotel! I will definitely be back! This hotel is an elegant throw back to the hay days of Chicago in the early 20th century. Lovely architecture. It is so well maintained, a jewel. The lobby bar is not to be missed. Potter is also great place to have a cocktail or glass of wine during a city walk or before heading out to dinner. Our room had 2 beds and 2 full baths, making it perfect for me and my traveling companion.

"PAST GLORIESThis hotel is a landmark. As far as Chicago is concerned, it has been there forever. The passport control officer at the airport during his checks asked where we were staying. He made the comment that the hotel was the centre of wheeler dealing and conferences within the city.We arrived at the hotel quite late at night and were greeted at the entrance by one of their valets / doorman by name. It appears these guys check who is arriving and at what time, now thats a greeting.The hotel is big. To get to reception you need to walk through the lower level shopping mall to the elevator (lifts) to the lobby. The lobby is a grand affair of marble and polished brass. Adjacent to the lobby is what can only be described as the Grand Hall; and it is grand. Columns, marble, floral displays and a high high painted ceiling. It is impressive now, customers must have been gobsmacked when the hotel was built over 100 years ago.After we were efficiently booked in, we made our way to our room on the 8th floor. Now we had been warned by a family member that the ""Loop"" train passes alongside the hotel and to check that the room wasn't that side of the building. They did not warn us about what we experienced. The room was large, and relatively modern, but dated version of art decor (black painted, not lacqued furniture). There were windows, there were blinds and curtains; there was just no view...just a brick wall ! A small, but adequate bathroom and no tea or coffee making facilities. We initially agreed that the room was ok as we were only staying 5 nights. We had a good night sleep, so the beds and linen were decent. We just could not stay in a room with no natural light. So we checked with reception for availability for a paid upgrade. So for our second and subsequent nights we slept in our upgraded room on the 23rd floor. We were lucky, we made our enquiry on a Thursday when most conferences and meetings were ending and rooms were becoming available. Again no view, but it did have natural light and access to Executive lounge (mentioned later). The room was again a nice size, with two bathrooms (handy for couples), but smaller than the one on the 8th floor. Again, for all nights we had a decent sleep.HOTEL CATERINGWe arrived late on our first night and tired from our Trans-Atlantic flight so we had our first experience of hotel food in Potters Bar. Potters Bar is named after the hotels founder Potter Palmer. It is a small bar off of the lobby. Wood panelled and dimly lit, the bar is used by conference delegates and business men finalising a deal. The bars menu consists of basic burger, fried chicken and pizza fayre, but all is well cooked, tasty and served fast. They also have a pretty fine liquor menu and I can personally recommend their India Pale Ale !Lockwood Restaurant - a brightly lit modern style restaurant off of the Grand Hall. Its decor is completely out of keeping with the rest of the ornate lobby area.We arrived at the restaurant for breakfast at 8.30am and had to wait nearly 30 minutes for a table for two. The reason for the wait is the restaurant size is totally inadequate for the size of the hotel and they allow guests to hold business meetings at tables whilst other guests wait. If this wait wasn't insult enough the buffet breakfast was the worst I have ever experienced in any hotel in any country. It had either been cooked poorly or had not been managed correctly whilst on the hot counter. After eating a few bites we both left the ""cooked"" food and resorted to bread ,jam and pastries.The place was hardly a relaxing environment, these business people not only hogged tables for their meeting, they did not talk at a reasonable level, all they did was shout.Executive Lounge - after our experience with the Lockwood Restaurant we were pleased that we had access to the lounge for breakfast, for the most part. They had a very good selection of cold meats,loads of boiled eggs, breakfast cereals, oatmeal / porridge, breads, fresh cooked pastries and fresh fruit. For most days the lounge was kept well stocked for breakfast, but it seems they started to experience interloppers. It appears some people from the non-exec floors had managed for find their way onto the lounge floor and had gone through the food like ""locusts"". When we arrived a member of staff were busily replenishing the stocks whilst another was checking every guest key card for their entitlement.Things were okay over the weekend, then on Monday the business people returned and hogged the tables in the lounge. Not only that, they stole chairs from other tables, leaving other guests to carry chairs from one end of the lounge to another to make up a ""working"" table to dine at.I have marked the service as average, but this does not reflect the high level of service in Potters Bar and the Executive Lounge. Sadly it was Lockwoods that dropped the overall score.SecurityThe hotel is situated within the ""Loop District"", the area encompassed by the elevated railway. A family member recommended this hotel, with the caveate that the loop area had a reputation for street crime (this was declared in a science conference info pack they had received). We did not experience any problems during our stay, but that can possibly attributed to the burly Bouncers / Security guards that appeared on the Mall entrance doors after dark.The lower floors have no security other than the security staff previouly mentioned and and can be accessed from street level. The exec floor lifts require a key card for them to work.Summary : The lobby and Grand Hall are impressive and worth a look whilst sightseeing the city. As for the rooms, they are well maintained, comfortable but dated. The staff (excluding the Lockwood) provided excellent service.The corridor on the 8th floor had black and white photographs of past celebrity guests (Frank Sinatra, Eartha Kitt etc). That kind of says it all. The hotel is a landmark living off of its past.We slept well, but would we stay again ? No, the place is too much hassle for a vacation.


Room Tip: Go for floors above 12 and ask for side of building away from elevated trains.

"This hotel is an elegant throw back to the hay days of Chicago in the early 20th century. Lovely architecture. It is so well maintained, a jewel. The lobby bar is not to be missed. A great place to have a cocktail or glass of wine during a city walk or before heading out to dinner. Some rooms have 2 beds and 2 full baths, making them very comfy for a group of family. I've stayed here dozens of times for business and fun and never been disappointed."
"Nothing negative to say about our 5 day stay in the Palmer House Hotel. Decor was amazing, like stepping back in time. Our room was spacious and spotlessly clean as was the rest of the hotel. Lobby area was breathtakingly beautiful. Every member of staff that we encountered were way beyond helpful. Special mention to Tatiyana the lady that checked us in, her warmth and genuine interest in us really shone through. Would come back to this hotel in a heartbeat."
"I've stayed in the Palmer House several times this year and it was ok. This time the room seemed incomplete- no refrigerator and no glasses or cups in the bathroom. Also, no coffee cups or packets. From the first we had problems with the sink draining. The water just sat there. I guess we weren't that surprised when the toilet stopped working. The desk didn't seem to be that surprised or concerned when we reported it. I've had better service a Holiday Inn. Not what we expected."
"Aside from a great location, the staff at this hotel has been trained to please their customers in every way. They are very friendly, eager to help and assist in any possible way. Congratulations to the Hotel Manager, great job!! The entire hotel is a grand dame, kept in very good condition. The food at the lobby restaurant was great, very creative, unusual ingredients. My birthday celebration was made more memorable by the hospitality of the staff.

"The Palmer House is right in the heart of Chicago, close to Millennium Park, the Bean, Architecture, the theatre, symphony, fabulous restaurants. The hotel is vintage, but exceptionally maintained. The main hall, where there is a restaurant, bar, comfy seating, registration, and much more, envelopes you in beauty. My sister and I stayed 3 nights in a nicely appointed room, had daily cocktails in the main hall, and walked everywhere. Hotel staff were helpful and the concierge assisted us in planning our stay. Worth staying at!"
"The Palmer House still evokes elegance after all these years. This is the second time I visited this hotel. My husband and I stayed for 2 nights. Our room was comfortable and clean and was located at the same floor of the executive lounge. The alcoholic beverages were not free. Only the coffee , soda and water were. The concierge and bell service were excellent. The porter who brought our suitcases down to the lobby was very kind. I particularly liked the TV history presentation of the Palmer House and how Bertha Palmer donated some valuable works of art to the Art Institute Museum of Chicago"
"The Palmer House is a very Grand Hotel. It has the class from years gone by and is kept us nicely. Some room are fairly small with only one double bed but there are other room that are extremely large. The staff is friendly and helpful. They have a free business center with about 5 computers. Overall a very classy place! Also a great location on State Street with lots of public transportation and restaurants nearby.

Green Features: They seem to recycle. Also they ask if you want to reuse you towels and other items in bathroom."
"Came to the Palmer House for a trade conference and got pretty much what I expected for a ""historic"" hotel. By that I mean the pluses are great location and some stunning architecture. What that also means is small rooms. Also disappointed that at a $200 (plus tax) per night hotel, such simple things as a coffee maker and mini-fridge were not to be found. Neither was free internet (frankly this is getting ridiculous for ANY hotel to charge for internet in this day and age). Got in early in the morning. Room was not ready but what was really nice was the woman ran my keys anyway and texted me when the room was ready--saving a return trip to the front desk and waiting in line again. Would I come again? Probably not. There are too many more modern hotels in downtown Chicago at about the same price point with bigger rooms and better ameneties."
"My boyfriend and I stayed here for one night for his birthday in beginning of May 2015. It is a beautiful, historic hotel and is a great place for a couples getaway. The lobby is breathtaking. I love the ornate details when you walk in to check out or for a drink in the lobby bar. Great location for sightseeing and shopping. I am very happy with our stay and would highly recommend anyone to stay here for one night for a piece of Chicago history!"
"The location of the hotel was fine, it was very close to the Art Institute and Millennium Park, and of course near lots of restaurants.The hotel is old, originally built in the late 1800s, and some parts of the hotel retain some of that original charm.Our room was just OK. It was clean. It had a desk, the bed was comfortable. However, it was kind of cramped feeling. The bathroom especially felt small. Our room, being near the elevators, was noisy. It also seemed like a lot of light made its way in at night - from around the curtains, and under the door. It did not make for a good sleeping environment.The hotel has a pool and gym. I can't comment on the pool as I did not visit it, but I did use the gym. It was decent with plenty of cardio machines (treadmills, ellipticals, and stationary bikes) and some weight machines.


Room Tip: Try to get a room away from the elevators

"1st of all, this isn't your standard hotel, it's connected to many other businesses inside, which is cool in itself. My husband and I stayed here May 2, 2015, to see a Cubs game and although the hotel rooms are a little dated, the overall experience is a must. The dining room is huge and looks like you are back in the 20s/30s. And it's located next to many great restaurants, we went to Italian Village, which I recommend also."
"Save your money and stay at a Motel 6, at least there you will get your money's worth and not ripped off, like I was. This Hotel is in the Heart of Downtown Chicago. The room rate was Super High for !79.00 plus taxes for Saturday and 259.00 for Sunday plus taxes ,the bad and drab amenities you will not like or enjoy. Room was falling apart from the wall paper to the nasty carpets, plugged up shower and tub drain. You could hear through the paper thin walls your neighbor flushing toilet. I will never go back to that Hotel."
"I spent three nights here while on a business trip in Chicago. Check-in was swift and pleasant. I asked about WiFi at check in. It is not complimentary which I always find disappointing, but if you ordered it there and then at the front desk you saved a couple of dollars a day. I liked this hotel. My room was on the smaller side but clean and comfortable. The only issue I had was the lack of a coffee maker in the room. I had lunch at the hotel's Potter's Lounge Bar. I sat at the bar with a friend and had a sandwich. Service was good. The sandwich was good but expensive. The hotel has an excellent location within a couple of minutes walk from both the Art Institute and Millennium Park. Not surprisingly, there are plenty of shops, restaurants, and bars nearby. I did opt for Valet Parking - again expensive but that was my choice. Check-out was a breeze as you simply left your room key in your room. I would definitely consider staying in this hotel again if I was in Chicago."
Hotel is in a great location near restaurants and theater. Shopping nearby and in the hotel. Food was good and plentiful on the 23rd floor for evening snack and breakfast. The room was lacking in attention as there were no towels and the toilet had been used and not flushed or probably not cleaned! Found someone's t-shirts left in the dresser. TV had to be reset. Expected more......at this beautiful landmark!
"I have stayed at the Palmer House a great number of times and it never disappoints. Depending the floor, there are portraits of entertainers who played the Empire Room, or historic photos of Chicago. The lobby ceiling was wonderfully restored and is something to see. The rooms might be a little on the small side, but taking into account that it is an older hotel, that makes sense, and the rooms are still very comfortable. The Palmer House is situated in the Loop and near lots of theatres, and just a bit south of the Michigan Avenue shopping district. The el drops off/picks up very nearby for most lines. For me, it is the hotel of choice when visiting Chicago."
"I was here on honeymoon for five days. On a previous trip to Chicago I had marveled at the gorgeous lobby and vowed one day to stay here. Well I did and it was decidedly average. Some of the public areas of the hotel are indeed stunning and historic, but the rooms themselves are just OK. Two things really ruined my stay here. One: there is no coffeemaker or kettle in the room. So you cannot have a morning coffee without leaving your room and running down to the Starbucks in the lower lobby, which is inconvenient and expensive. Two: it turns out this is a big convention hotel. This means that the beautiful lobby you were hoping to enjoy is constantly crammed full of conventioneers day and night. It also means that the Starbucks has a 20+ line in the mornings. On the plus side, the hotel is well located for the major sights, and is also easy to reach via public transport from the airport. If you want to have a luxury hotel experience with all the trimmings pick a different hotel to stay in. The website would have you believe that you will be transported back to an age of glamour and luxury, but the reality is that this is a convention hotel with small rooms and mediocre amenities.


Room Tip: If you bag an accessible room they are larger. The regular rooms are small.

"If you want a contemporary hotel experience there are multiple choices in Chicago that provide the amenities of the current times. The Palmer House survives because it exemplifies a different era. Numerous times during my weekend stay I was impressed by the commitment to retrain a hotel experience that cannot be replicated in a modern building. How easy it would be to gut the building floor by floor to compete with a new hotel. Fortunately for us, we are left with a time machine. The true allure of this 1600 room living history lesson has little to do with the architecture. The lobby is bustling, the banquet rooms are active, the staff is polished. The hotel is vibrant. I never felt like I was in a museum.Yes, I saw the stain in the wallpaper, the crack in the tile, and the line for coffee at Starbucks. It just didn't detract from my experience.

"I have been to the Palmer House Hilton for a couple of times, but this time it was not a very nice experience. I arrived late (around 9.30 - 10 pm) in February (in icy Chicago). Two entrances were closed, nobody to help with the suitcases downstairs on street level. No welcoming word from the check-in desk, the lady was as icy as the cold outside. I was given two bottles of water (as a gold HH), not very practical when you have two large suitcases (they did not have a bag). No bell boy. I checked in at executive level. The lounge was closed (most of the time I was there). Room was large but there was not even a coffe-maker in it (which is standard in the US). Next day breakfast at the executive lounge was nothing to write home about. When I later came back to have a coffee (as I did not have a coffe machine in my room) I found the lounge closed. No explanation. No time-table with opening hours. A lady came by and said they were cleaning the lounge! After three tries I just abandoned the idea of having my coffee there.Location of the Palmer House is excellent though, near to the Art Institute. The swimming pool is ok as well (nobody seems to know there is one). But that is about all I could appreciate. Don't take the executive level, it is not worth it.

"This property was selected by the company, but am glad it was. Very convenient to get to on the Orange line of the ""L"" (half a block to the side entrance). Despite the room not being ready, they have a convenient system for early check in. They give you the key, but not the room number. When the room's ready they text you the number so you don't stop by the front desk again, you head right to the room. Just one example of solid service they provide. Stay at the end of the hall of you want quiet - but realize it's a hike if you have small children or a lot of baggage. Make sure to check out the lobby, Emeral Room, etc. - all the historical aspects of the hotel. It's very easy to take the elevator from street level to your floor and miss out on the interesting parts!

"Rates: My frustration is when the rates drop as you get closer to your arrival date and you have booked a non-refundable rate! The rate dropped by $50/night!Location: Hotel is very central. If you have never been here, you will be a little confused as the main floor is on the first floor, and the escalators and elevators to the lobby/check-in are way in the back.Ambiance: The lobby ceiling is gorgeous - a must see. There is a large lobby bar and a restaurant behind it.Rooms: Although the hotel seemed quite empty, the best upgrade was on a regular room higher floor away from the L. The room was spacious but the bathroom was small. The outlets in the lamps have become loose and need work.Special Issue: I got up in the morning with an aggressive attack of allergy. Not common to me. I asked the front desk if I could change rooms. They advised that all rooms are cleaned the same way but they could try to ""de-allergify"" [My word!] my room. They thoroughly cleaned the room, changed the pillows. linen etc. No room spray, and I had a peaceful second night. It was highly appreciated!Service: Besides the superb service above, I was disappointed that my bill was wrong at check-out. I tried calling from my room and went on an unacceptably long hold. So came down and it was quickly fixed.

"As most of the reviews on here say, the hotel is beyond stately, historical and convenient. It was a great time during the nfl draft. The room was ok but was a little bit of a let down after seeing the other parts of the hotel. It was your typical hilton room but nothing over the top. I'm sure they have nicer rooms for more money but this was at the top of my budget at $300. If I had my family with me I would splurge for the larger rooms with out hesitation."
"This hotel is a beautiful, grand, stately historic building. Beyond that our room was just average at best. I was aware from reading other reviews that there is no coffee maker in the room. However the lines for coffee at Starbucks were so long we were forced to purchase coffee from room service for $9.00 a pot plus a $5.00 delivery charge. The bathroom was extremely small. For what you pay I expected to be blown away but was far from that. The Conrad Hilton is a much better choice for the price. Won't be staying at the Palmer House again."
"We got to Chicago mid day, and walked the few blocks after taking the L. First off, the Palmer House is hands down beautiful! Check in was a breeze, and we were told about all the perks of being on the Executive Level. Private key, breakfast every morning, free snacks and sodas/water....After staying on this level, there is no going back. The bed was by far the most comfortable thing we slept on our entire two week trip! So much so my husband wanted to take it with us :) The hotel is close to lots of sights and food....Go to the Irish Pub on Walbash- we ate their three times in our two nights stay! We are already planning another trip Tampa FL, and Hilton has our loyalty.

"My husband and I stayed at the Palmer House recently to celebrate my 50th birthday. We had stayed there before several years ago and found it lovely and extremely convenient to many downtown Chicago attractions. We both love grand old historic hotels, and this is definitely one of them. For the recent trip we made a reservation for a king room about three weeks before the visit through the hotel's web site. We checked in at about 1 pm (well before check-in time was supposed to even begin) and were told that no king rooms were available. We were initially told that only a double room was available. I showed the receptionist the reservation confirmation information that I had printed out. It said: Hip and Historic King, Nonsmoking confirmedShe said that the ""confirmed"" only referred to the ""nonsmoking"" part. She said she could give us a queen room. I was very disappointed with the room we ended up with; it was very small, had a view of a wall and received no daylight at all, and the bed was not what we had requested and was not that comfortable. And it was next to the service elevator.I called the front desk and asked if there was any way we could switch to a king sized room; we would be willing to pay more for it, as this was a very special occasion for us. They said they could not do that, but did take off $25 from the room rate and gave us vouchers for free breakfasts at the hotel the next morning. So I have mixed feelings. I still remember the feeling of wanting to cry when I saw the room. The room we had on our previous visit had been so much nicer, and it would have meant so much to me to have had a decent room for this special occasion. They did try to make some amends, but ultimately, what I will always remember now about that hotel was the dark tiny room and smaller than requested bed and not the free breakfast or the discount on the room.


Room Tip: I have no advice, except be prepared NOT to get the room you expected when you made the reservation.

"this is a very historic hotel with a beautiful lobby. And the meeting rooms are very large and pleasing to the eye. While I would stay here again because of the central location and proximity to the ""L."" I would like to warn everyone to things that I will be aware of next time.- Early arrival charge-$25 which I was not prepared for, but needed to get into my room to get ready for meeting.- If you are given a room on the 8th floor, be sure to ask if your room backs up to the pool. My room did, and I was not told, and when I looked out the translucent window, I realized I backed up to the indoor pool. Which by not having a window made me feel as if I was in a jail cell.My air conditioner in the room was not good. It was comfortable but not able to cool it down. And my shower had some issues along with the door.One good thing I can say is that the workout center is one of the nicest I have ever seen in a hotel.I would maybe stay here again, but I will ask many more questions. To say I am disappointed would be correct."
"On entering the hotel, we were very impressed with the opulent lobby. Our room could have done with a bit of updating & bathroom small. However, the location of the hotel is just great for reaching Chicago's main attractions. A lovely little cafe for breakfast a few doors down, considerably cheaper than in hotel. Although the train line passes the door, our room wasn't noisy. A comfortable stay."
"Upon entering the property it oozed luxury ... deep, richly colored carpeting and marble floors, beautiful central sitting and bar area with extremely high and decorated ceilings and walls, professional looking registration area, and a bank of opulent but old style elevators. We had a 2 double bed room on 20th floor (if I recall) that was HUGE. You could literally have added 2 more double beds to the room. Had not one, bt TWO walk in closets, a dresser drawer set, and a work desk. Decor wasn't particularly special, except for some antique fixtures that you may consider either charming or just old (depending on your taste). Only odd part was that the beds were just doubles and there was clearly enough room for Queen sized, or even King! Oh, and the bathroom, by comparison, was quite small. Given that the only sink was inside the bathroom, it did cause a challenge for more than one person getting ready in the morning. Location was real highlight as it is within walking distance to the Art Institute, The Bean, and local parks. Can also walk the loop. Even if you prefer to take a taxi instead of walking to further out areas, the cost is reasonable given the central location.Cost was on par or better with what I would expect (mid $200s/night) for the area. So I would consider this a good value and would stay here again."
"I love this hotel, but regrettably will never stay here again. I am a silver elite member and checked in early (11ish). The clerk asked me if I would like a room now or check in after the requisite check in time (3p). I said I would love a room now as I had to change and get ready for a big meeting. They said, well we do have rooms available, but it will cost you an additional $25 to check in early. I really could not believe they would treat a loyal Hilton Honors member this way. So, I went to the lobby bathroom, washed myself off the best I could, changed and went off to my meeting feeling that this was a low blow to such a loyal member. I will never stay at this hotel again...as lovely as it is. There are plenty other hotels that would have been happy to give en elite member (or anyone for that matter) a room early if they had it available in the name of great customer service and relationship building. Really trashy thing to do."
"I have been going to the Palmer House for about 35 years. The facility is older and well maintained. The lobby is stunning. Rooms are comfy and well appointed. If you look on the website there are times when you can book a room for a steal, for the quality of this hotel. Located one block from the Art Institute of Chicago and right near stylish State Street shops, and near the Theater District The staff are helpful and warm and the service is excellent. Parking is in a ramp across the street with in and out privileges and easy access. I love this hotel and it is my Chicago home when I am in the windy city."
My daughter and I stayed here for only one night but were very impressed by the cleanliness and updated room. We loved the old world feel of the lobby and the decor in the hallways. The hotel was very centrally located and the self parking package that we attached to our room was convenient and easy to access. The price of the room was very competitive with other hotels we were considering but the parking package made it a better deal.
"I stayed in March 2015 accompanying my husband on a business trip. We typically enjoy grand old hotels, and are not easily put off by smaller room and bathroom size. The lobby bar is beautiful, as shown in the photos, and has a nice vibe for winding down at the end of the day. Downside, drink prices a bit steep for what it is.Unfortunately, the bed and pillows were very uncomfortable. Otherwise the room was adequate, if in need of updating. The upside of this hotel is the excellent fitness center, which had great equipment and several classes offered each day. It seemed as if the fitness center was also open to members who were not guests of the hotel, which probably accounts for the high quality of amenities and classes. If a good fitness center is a priority for selecting a hotel, then this one should not be overlooked. Service at the concierge desk was also very good. The staff there was eager to help and patient with providing directions and suggestions even at busy times."
I was lucky enough to stay three glorious nights in this historic downtown hotel. The lobby is truly astounding with the old world feel! Check out the glorious ballrooms.The staff was super helpful! I want to call out Manny Batres who went out of his way in customer service! I left my Dell computer charger behind and he looked through the lost and found and brought several to my room until he found one that worked!Bravo Manny for making my stay productive! I will be back!
Stayed at the Palmer House because it was less than a block away from the Bank of America Theater. The rooms were clean and comfortable. The lobby meeting area is amazing. The area is a huge room with a bar and many sofas and tables and a high vaulted ceiling straight from the 1920s. Well worth sitting there and having a drink even if you don't stay there. Question: Why do you get free Wi-Fi at cheap motels and have to pay at expensive hotels? Just wondering.
"Palmer House Hilton is located in the middle of downtown Chicago. We were able to walk to the Art Institute of Chicago (2 blocks), Millennium Park (2 blocks), and took a short Metra train ride (the station was also about a two block walk) to the Museum complex where we were able to go to the Field Museum and the Shedd Aquarium. (We got the City Pass which I highly recommend to anyone interested in doing these types of activities.) There were many restaurants within walking distance as well. Across the street was an Italian restaurant called Vapiano that was very good. We ate at the Lockwood, the hotel restaurant, the first night. We were introduced to a new brewary there (Revolution Brewing) and the food was very good... but the waiter was so solicitous, he almost made us miss the show we had booked for the first night. Luckily the Bank of America theater was less than a block away, so we made it to The Book of Mormon with 5 minutes to spare.When I say Location: this hotel made it so we only had to take a taxi once on our whole 4 night stay. We came to the Housewares convention and went two days to that, and still were able to pack many activities in thanks to their proximity to this hotel.The staff was very nice and attentive. When we first arrived in the downstairs area, and looked lost, a staff member who was walking by not only greeted us, but accompanied us on the elevator to the desk to check in. (In fact many people in Chicago stopped and offered us directions when we were walking around looking lost. Very friendly and helpful city in general). We also spilled a drink on the bed a few nights into our stay, and someone was up to change the bedding with 5 minutes. The room itself was on the small side, but clean and the bed was comfortable. We were on the 14th floor, so we had a nice view. The lobby area has very ornate ceiling and it is decorated in a throwback style that is charming. There is a bar in this area, but it was fairly crowed, so we didn't really hang out there. Drawbacks: Wi-Fi is not free. Loud neighbors the second night who went in and out of rooms constantly (loud slamming doors). Neighbor's room service trays in hallway in morning were there the next day. Had to tell someone they were there. Shower temp was hit or miss. Some mornings tepid, some burning hot. Once went ice cold on my fiancee. Overall the Palmer House Hilton was a nice hotel. Great location, friendly and helpful staff, and comfortable bed.


Room Tip: Higher floors have a better view (duh).

"My room was generally great, especially at the price and the rating would have been higher if not for abysmally slow Wi-Fi - Hilton needs hotels to upgrade this feature and my loud neighbor with a whooping cough that woke me up at 5am. My suite was gigantic and therefore it's amazing the walls and doors were that paper thin. Otherwise, temp was good, good hotel location, clean room and a good price. The last price of feedback is the executive lounge needs to be bigger or laid out better. It was a pain to get breakfast - the selection was average."
"The lobby is very stately, but not ostentatious. We enjoyed relaxing, and drinking the lemon water while waiting for our check in. The exercise facilities are really good. In addition to the usual treadmills and stationary bikes, they also had a good selection of free weights and machines, as well as a pool, hot tub, and steam room.  We had breakfast at their restaurant, the Lockwood. The buffet was fresh and had a great selection of food, and the servers were attentive.  The hotel is within easy walking distance of Magnificent Mile, Millennium Park, and several good restaurants. The Palmer House is a credit to the Hilton Brand and to the city of Chicago."
"The hotel, the room decor and the ambiance are second to none. However . . . my wife and I booked a King Suite which comes with a wet bar. Unfortunately, the wet bar is virtually useless unless you have your room catered to by the hotel. There were no glasses, no plates, no utensils -- nothing except a small refrigerator (and no minibar). There was not even a coffee maker. I get that the hotel wants you to use room service, but not even a coffee maker? I expect more from a luxury hotel suite."
"This is my third trip to Chicago for the America's Beauty Show and I have stayed at other hotels in Chicago on previous trips but the Palmer House Hilton to me is the best! The location is great to navigate the city! From midway you can take the Orange line to Adams/Wabash and you are right there at the entrance of the hotel! The Art Institute is a block and a half away, the bean is close by, so is the magnificent mile as well as the red line for the subway is just steps away from the entrance on State, this hotel is fabulous! The hotel itself is gorgeous, the beds are comfy and so are the pillows, there's lots of shops, conveniences like a Starbucks and a gorgeous lounge and dining room, make sure you look up and appreciate the ceiling!The hotel has everything, the staff is top notch! One in particular that stands out is DJ the doormen that had recommended places to eat, things to do and always greeted us with a smile and willingness to help us find our way around the city! Did I mention he suggested the best tiramisu I've ever had in my life!!! I leave Chicago tomorrow (March 23, 2015) and I'm already starting to plan my next trip back to explore this city even more!!!P.s. If you see DJ (you can't miss him he's tall, with a great smile and broad shouldered) ask him for tips about the city, you won't be disappointed!!!!"
"Such a beautiful hotel! Even as a a Diamond member, I was totally impressed! Beautifully updated and close to museums. We wanted to see if we could figure out how to get from Midway to hotel on the train vs cab simply as an adventure or challenge. So much for the challenge....every time we stopped to study a map, a helpful and friendly local would volunteer info! What a wonderful city!It was an easy ride on the Orange line to Adams/Wabash. The hardest part was actually finding the lobby to hotel. It's hidden among shops without an obvious sign. The lobby is on the second floor. We had reserved with points, and although I had a confirmation number, my reservation wasn't confirmed with the hotel. We had dinner reservations in just a couple of hours, so we almost began to panic, but the front desk clerk was very reassuring that all would work out. They upgraded us to executive floor which included free breakfast and all day snacks. We were on the TOP floor, which could have been amazing, but with a courtyard view, it means we simply looked across at the other rooms on the 23rd floor. Not that we we weren't grateful....just saying if you request a high floor, be sure to request a city view. The rooms are historic, but beautifully updated. Housekeeping staff was efficient, polite and professional. Left the room sparkling clean without over spraying fragrance. So nice to return to a clean room!Had high tea at Lockwood in hotel. Look for review."
"Like so many other reviews, I arrived knowing I got a good deal and that the location is hard to beat. We were there for the last shopping weekend before Christmas and the energy and crowds didn't disappoint. With that said, the check in lines were extremely long when we got to the hotel. Lucky for us - and kudos to the staff - the Palmer provided lines for HiltonHonor members so we were treated to a quick check in. The hotel is amazing. Grand lobby, old wood finishes, decor that transports you back to another time. The room will do the same as it is old, small and ""historic"" - so code for a bit outdated but tolerable given your surroundings. The bath had everything you would want, the room was clean and there was plenty of water pressure (and hot water). The location was great. If you are willing to walk in the cold, stay here at Christmas time and you can easily walk to - Grant Park where you can ice skate, Michigan ave shopping, the German market in the plaza and all the food and drinking you can manage. Check out was as easy as check in and the nearby parking - which was a concern going in - was easily navigated and managed. We will stay here again..."
"Once you get past the fancy lobby everything falls apart. My room stank, I constantly heard the people in the next room having a normal conversation, and the bathroom was so small I could not turn around without hitting the wall. On top of it all I was staying here on Business and the hotel was part of the conference I was attending and they charged me $10 a day for internet. That is taking advantage of the customer. In this day and age you cannot do without it so you have no choice but to pay their price. I would not stay at this hotel again."
"This is a beautiful hotel with beautiful rooms, centrally located to the major museums and good dining. We stayed with the chillcation package and got free breakfast buffet, which was very good, and 50% discount on parking. We loved the hotel... Except both mornings there was no hot water for a shower. First morning the hot water was available after 10am and this threw a wrench in our plans for the day. The second morning we got up at 600 hoping for a better result, but alas the shower that started tepid quickly turned to ice.Not what I would expect from a hotel in this category and at this price point."
"The gilded age becomes your stage when staying at the Palmer House. Beautiful neoclassical details surround you in pure decadent luxury. From the peacock-motif hallway carpets to the ornately detailed lobby with its hand-painted ceiling, you truly feel as if you've stepped into another era. Our room was fantastic, with two washrooms and a sitting area, and the staff were pros at going above and beyond to offer excellent service. Starbucks is on hand in the morning, and a pool and hot tub offer relaxation at the end of a long day visiting museums. And the location! Within walking distance to the Bean, Millenium Park, the Art Institute, Chicago Cultural Center and Bergoff's. A true delight, the Palmer House offers convenience, luxury and great service, all without pretention. We will definitely book again!"
"This is a beautiful old hotel that has been nicely refurbished. I was upgraded to a Hilton floor room and it was quite large with two bathrooms. I suspect this is an exception and that most of the rooms are smaller. I am in a room with an adjoining door and my next door neighbors are relatively noisy and I can hear them having a good time, so ask for a room that doesn't have the door. The room service breakfast was good and arrived early. The room is newly and tastefully decorated. The bed is too soft, but the linens are nice. If you push them a bit they are likely to comp you wifi. I would definitely consider staying here if you are in Chicago.


Room Tip: See notes above. Do not expect much of a view with any of the rooms.

"I tell my family if they ever wonder where I went, I may be at The Palmer House. Their lobby alone is worth the stay. I have visited many times during my lifetime and will continue to only stay at The Palmer House when in Chicago. Their service is unparalleled, the lobby and bar- iconic and the rooms- spacious & updated. Ask for the 2 bed/2 bath- and the Executive floor is a great value, especially if traveling as a family or group. Enjoy!


Room Tip: 2 bed 2 bath combo on the Executive Floor is awesome

"The Palmer House is a stately older Hilton located in loop downtown area of Chicago. Decor is Art Deco and the lobby is on a grand scale. Rooms tend to be a bit on the smaller side, and could use some updating. However, has all of the modern conveniences and right in the central bbusiness dstrict with closeby shopping, eentertainment and restaurants. The loobby bar is also great, and Tim the bartender gets 5 stars.. You can also order food from the Lockwood fine dining restaurant while at the bar, or just order from the bar menu. My wife and I stayed for 2 nights while on business, and I'll come back! he shopped during the day, and acy''s/Nordstrom's are closeby within walking distance."
"I spend a week in this hotel during New Year day. Location is ideal for exploring Chicago. You are close to the lake, little bit further to downtown. You have subway station next to the hotel with many fast foods, so great for me. I would say rooms are vintage, it means they are old and small, typical for old Chicago, so if you love this style, you will love the whole hotel. The view from room was very nice. Palmer House Hilton has the greatest lobby I've ever seen, you need to see it even if you are not accommodated in the hotel.But there is really bad situated front desk! I wouldn't find front desk without help! It is somehow in first floor and you can reach it only with tiny escalators (with all the baggage). One more thing - paid Wi-Fi...?!?! Really?!Anyway i would definitely came back again."
"Had a rather poor experience with our stay at this hotel from the minute we got out of the car until we left. Combative doorman almost had a fist fight with our driver over the luggage cart, confused checkin process and a long wait to be processed.Concierge refused to help accept deliveries and to hold items for delivery to the room...received very un customer friendly responses to our requests. Elevators were often over crowded or non operational during peak hours forcing us to use the service lifts in order to get to and from the room. Rooms were incredibly small and had views of the alley. We had a drunk try to break into the room at 3AM causing considerable stress for my wife.Not worth the money we paid...better options around the corner; the only plus for the hotel is the location."
"Stayed with family over Christmas and it has a charm that cannot be matched by any other hotel in Chicago. The lobby is beautiful, amazing really. But upon check in our rooms weren't ready, so we headed to the lobby's bar. Drinks are over $10 and it would have been a nice gesture if the hotel would have comped these since we were waiting on them. When I did say something to the front desk about the delay (two bloody marys later) they did offer us breakfast. But over an hour was too long to wait to check in, AND it was after 5pm. I would have given this hotel a four, but these things should be anticipated by the hotel."
"I am currently typing this review from their room. I really want to love this hotel, I truly do. First, the lobby is absolutely gorgeous. Location you cannot beat. Room is really pleasant. For a Hilton it shows great disappointment though. Quality, is a miss. The devils is in the details. They do charge for wifi in the room, which I can live with. Some things are a bit outdated, phone near the bed does not function. But a standard room does not come with a fridge. Motel 8 has a fridge, there is a clear imprint on the floor of a fridge having lived there.I feel that they removed the fridge and wanted more money for the conference. I would give it a 1, but with location I had to bump it up. Once I return to Chicago, I will look into other options more carefully, (Marriot, Westin, etc.). This hotel totally changed my view for Hilton."
"I'm a Diamond Hilton Honors member and was surprised to find... PUBIC HAIRS IN THE SHOWER. After asking for the shower to be cleaned, I instead received two pairs of bath slippers. And still a dirty shower! I complained and was told that one of the managers would be notified. Then I was offered a free water and breakfast, which I already get free. Useless. Needing a recharge on my electronics, I plugged in my laptop only to find that the power outlets were not working. So my laptop died. Lame. Never staying at this disgusting place again.DO. NOT. STAY. HERE."
"historic hotel, good food at restaurant (Lockwood) and bar (Potters). The Executive floor (22 & 23) rooms are basic but good. The executive floor (23) lounge is large and comfortable with decent food for breakfast, appetizers and snacks. Some rooms are near the CTA tracks which might bother you. I was in 23/216 and the trains ran regularly. I noticed them but they didn't bother me. The shower head is unique, it pivots and has two heads and it works well enough.

"The good first - the location cannot be beat if you will be working or staying in the Loop area; it is very convenient. Also, the staff is very helpful and responsive. Now the cons - this is a very large hotel - 1600+ rooms, and very old hotel too. if you like very old style hotels that once were spectacular but that now badly need renovating, then this one's for you. The rooms are very variable in size and comfort. We were originally placed in a very very small room, that was simply too small for 2 people. After much fussing, we moved to a larger room, with 2 bathrooms and that improved the room situation. Housekeeping left a little to be desired, missed a few things one day. Overall, there are better hotels in Chicago that are more up to date and more comfortable.

"I stayed here at the hotel for a convention my husband was attending for a week. Everything that you need is all around you (stores, clothing retail, restaurants). thank goodness for nearby retail because we were not prepared for the cool weather. this place has a wonderful charm to it and we found our room to be very clean. it did have a tinge of smell but i kind of expect that from an older building. the gym was kept up nicely, had good equipment all around, and was a little bigger than expected. the nearby train makes it a bit noisy but maybe since our room was closer to State Street made it less of a nuisance. I had just wished there was a refrigerator in our room. the restaurants we ate at were always huge portion and with no fridge we had to throw a lot of food away. I felt so sad to leave such a wonderful hotel. it was really comfortable. Except i had forgotten a few articles in the safe. i called from the airport and left my information to have someone call me back. i did receive a call from security and was told that they did have my items but that i needed to forward them a copy of my ID to retrieve them. i faxed them the info and supplied additional info to confirm that the items belong to me. i was told that security would mail my items (spoke to a guy name Manny) but weeks passed and nothing!! what was the purpose of sending my personal information and now i have no idea what they are doing with it!!!"
"My stay was a combination business/pleasure trip, and it hit the mark on both counts. I stayed on the Exec. Level floor which, for just a little more than standard rates, is a great deal. The Wifi is free and there is a breakfast, daytime snacks and soft drinks etc. all throughout the day. There are nice seating/meeting spaces there as well. The room was generously sized and comfortable. Housekeeping was a little slow, and there was no evening turn down service. The hotel lobby is quite spectacular, very old european style with a grand lobby and amazing ceiling painting. The hotel has a lot of history, since it is over 150 years old I'm told. All the staff were friendly and accomodating and, given the price, I found it to be a solid value. If you want something other than the many ""modern"" hotels with more hip euro-style furnishings and decor, but still centrally located in the loop, Palmer might be the place for you. It was for me and I would return there.

"I have stayed here three times and never been disappointed. Staff are courteous and helpful we always feel relaxed and comfortable. The rooms are spacious and clean. Great location for everything, tried the drake in September 2014 and staff unfriendly especially reception wouldn't go back there.I will be back in May this year and will look forward to my stay at Palmer House. Will always stay here if possible we visit Chicago usually once a year for last six years and hopefully will continue to do so for many years.I cannot recommend this hotel highly enough its always a pleasure.


Room Tip: Try to get two doubles as room is great size and some have to bathrooms.

The Palmer House Hotel is a true classic hotel. The location is ideal. The check in team was excellent. The rooms were clean and really good sized compared to say the Hilton Towers. Now the reason for only a 4 dot rating. The rooms are starting to show their age w wallpaper peeling off the walls in the room and bathroom. The rooms were quiet and comfortable. It was very easy to get cabs or uber. This hotel is right off an L stop. I can't comment on the restaurant because we didn't stay to eat there. Very nice hotel you will not be disappointed.
"On my second visit to this bueatiful city I couldn't have stayed in a better place. Centrally located, served by public transport, main attractions within a stones throw and surrounded by plenty of eateries/restaurants its heaven for a tourist on a short visitThe hotel has architecturally rewarding ornate main bar which can rival any grade I listed building in the UKThe rooms are spacious with good wifi connection, spa is well run, steam oozing hot and they even provide dispisable razors ...need I add any moreThoughly enjoyed the stay"

"The traditional jewels originating this incredible property are alive! Everything is simply new again with revitalized original decor and style along with legendary service at every step throughout! The property is breathtaking and the rooms totally revamped to offer the glory that other hotels can't even imagine no matter how hard they try (for example the Andaz...losers!) The location is unbeatably close to the mellinial park, museums and magnificent mile shopping. Doormen great you and taxis are never a wait. This service culture flows through the blood of this traditional facility. Even Mathew, in security, saved the trip by retrieving and shipping our left behind cell phone....and he was even HAPPY to help! That is just one great example of how the entire staff is determined to make personal connection and build everlasting relationships with their guests! The bar and its vaulted and ornate ceiling sets an evironment that is the heart of the social atmosphere. The attendants are eager to serve. The convention facilities are unmatched along with the details that differentiate this great gem. Congrats to the Palmer House for setting the standard! I think I might have heard Andy Williams and Frank Sinatra having a chat somewhere within this timeless and perfect place!


Room Tip: All rooms are great! Ask for one of the larger rooms if available.

"this is one of the grand old hotels of the city. if you are looking for something that is not ""cookie-cutter"" this is it. starting with its grand lobby and going up through the nice sized rooms, this is a really good place. super staff - everything about this place is really great. rooms are clean, comfortable and nice sized. great location inside the loop and within a block of an elevated train station. rates were good, location was good, conceirge lounge is top-flight. no complaints whatsoever. i will stay here again"
"The Palmer House really is a classic grand hotel.When you arrive and enter the lobby you're greeted by a massive grand room with amazing ceilings. Lots of space to enjoy a drink, have a chat or get some work done on the fly.I've stayed here twice - both times for a business conference - and each time the thing that made the experience most memorable was the staff. Everyone is incredibly kind and professional.While the lobby, mezzanine and conference rooms (4th Floor) are spotless, I found the hallways to be dirty. The carpets were quite messy both times I stayed and on my most recent trip last week, there was garbage on the floor outside my room.The rooms themselves are very clean. Bathrooms are spotless, carpets are tidy and not a speck of dust to be found.While clean, the rooms are all very different. As is the case with many old hotels, all the rooms have different sized bathrooms and main rooms. For example, my bathroom this year was half the size of my bathroom last year and in order to close the door to bathroom I almost had to step into the shower.Another thing some colleagues complained about was the sound of the L trains that runs along S Wabash Ave right next to the hotel. I like white noise as it helps me sleep and had the benefit this year of being on the 20th floor however the lower you go the louder it gets. My suggestion is if you want to avoid the noise either give up the view and ask for an interior room for a room on a higher floor.


Room Tip: Select rooms on the higher floors to avoid L train noise.

"We stayed here right before X-mas 2014. The hotel was having a ton of construction done so it was a bit hectic. BUT the staff was great, very helpful and attentive. The bar area is georgeous and we sat out there both nights. Great location but one problem we had (throughout Chicago), our GPS on our phones did not work. Not sure why but we spent much of the trip lost!You will really like the hotel, though!"
"I really enjoyed my stay here. The hotel staff was very good (the staff at the lobby bars wasn't really that great), and the check-in and checkout processes were smooth. The lounge area is fantastic and a place to just sit and enjoy. The rooms were fine. A bit dated, but given the age of the hotel, certainly acceptable. The bed was great and the room an ample size. The internet in the common areas was about what you expect - slow and somewhat unreliable, but it was free outside of your guest room.As an added bonus, there is a Starbucks in the building, so you don't need to venture outside in the harsh winter months - assuming you like Starbucks that is."
"This hotel is a beautiful historic hotel in a perfect location for our needs. I greatly enjoyed the historical facts in the elevator. There are several meal options in and near the hotel and the rooms are nice and clean. We did have trouble with several of their direct reservation agents. The first one gave us the group discount on only 1 room of our block.The next one caught the error and added the discount to the rooms that were available (but, it wasn't available on one). Then I spent 20 minutes (twice) on the phone attempting to cancel a room from our group about a week before the trip. One agent seemed to switch the names on the reservation (double vs single rooms) At the end of the trip, I only received a receipt for 1 room. (free internet in lobby)"
"Great stay at this wonderful hotel! The lobby is beautiful with all the historic decorations and it looks like a palace. The room we had was a bit small but the king bed and pillows were really comfortable, which was kinda important for us after a whole day walking in February's cold weather. Hotel is very close to the Millennium Park and the Art Institute (about 10 minutes walk), and has a Macy's, a CVS and a lot of places to shop and dine nearby. And even the Skydeck and Magnificent Mile are within walking distance! The only problem was that there were no complimentary bottle water in the hotel if you're not a hilton member. In room wifi is not complimentary but they have free wifi in the lobby although we found it crowded and noisy at night, maybe because we went during the V-day weekend.


Room Tip: Choose the one with one king bed instead of the double bed. Pay a little bit more but worth it.

"recently stayed at the Palmer House HIlton Chicago for a special occasion. Paid extra for executive floor, what a joke. Old, run down, small rooms that are dirty and that do not even have an ipod dock nor is one available at the desk. Requested a quiet larger room and got a very noisy tiny room. The girl at check in informed me of the nice view ...it was a dumpster and a roof below. Staff is very, very rude and abrupt. Absolutely the worst hotel experience i have ever had. Please save your money and stay home or go to another hotel in the area...this one is just awful.


Room Tip: just stay away from this hotel all together

"Most rooms are not as spacious as shown in the picture here, but the hotel is nice. The beds are very comfortable. The bathrooms is rather small. I really like that you can use the stairs at this hotel. The workout area, pool, and hot tube are nice amentities. I did have some trouble finding outlets and the lamp outlets barely worked on the bedside table. I would recommend not getting a king bed as the room is really small then. Two doubles was nice sized. A trick to the hotel is not using main set of elevators, but the second set around the corner that goes to street level; you can get on the elevator faster."
"This is an amazing historic hotel with a fascinating and grandiose lobby! Lots of history here...Enjoyed having access to the large gym (included for hotel guests) and swimming pool.The rooms are just okay -- as you might expect from a hotel built >100 years ago, the standard king room is on the smaller side, with the bathroom being absolutely tiny (hard to navigate if you want to close/open the door). Also, the walls are a little thin and you may hear people in the next room. That said, the bed is comfy and it's generally well styled / maintained.We had breakfast at the Lockwood restaurant -- very good buffet option. Nice coffee. Great waiter (Tony)."
"I've stayed at the Palmer house on business on many occasions, and whilst I like the architecture, the main hall / reception has a wonderful ceiling, the hotel does often struggle. It seems to be a mecca for conferences / auditions or other activities that seem to attract thousands of school children, so every night the bar surrounds just seem to be filled with children (this time it was dance auditions followed by children's UN style meetings) which is very disconcerting and not what you expect. This time I had a split booking as my stay was extended, when I checked in I was told I would need to check out the next morning and check in again! You also need to be careful of noise, the hotel boarders the loop, and some of the rooms suffer badly with that, if you are disturbed by noise you need to be around the central courtyard


Room Tip: ask for a room away from the loop

"This was a staycation for my boyfriend and I who love historic buildings and all things Chicago. Although I've been to Lockwood (their restaurant) many times, I've never had the chance to stay the night. Beautiful room and very comfortable beds. I wish they had robes in the room, that would be my only complaint. Otherwise, great location for December especially, close to all the holiday fun on State street! Tip, If you can book in July, they have great rates!"
"The hotel itself is beautiful, the lobby is stunning and the entranceways and exits are beautiful, though they're a pain in the butt to get through with the crowds (We travelled over Thanksgiving). The rooms are small, but I guess that's to be expected in a big city (they're still bigger than in New York) The front desk staff was average in terms of helpfulness, but the concierge was very nice and gave advice with a smile. The bed in our room was very comfortable and the room itself was cozy, even though it was small. As for location, it was perfect. Close to Millenium Park, the Bean, the ice-skating rink, the Magnificent Mile, and tons of restaurants. For the price it was a very good decision; I would stay here again if we travelled back to Chicago. Be careful with taxis from O'Hare to Midway, they will not hesitate to rip you off!"
"My favorite hotel in Chicago, but not what it was before the company went public. Location is excellent, Ernest in the Executive Lounge is a delight, already peeled hard-boiled eggs on the Continental breakfast put other Hilton properties to shame and the lobby speaks for itself.Some of the really bad reviews I see here make no sense: people should expect small rooms for the lowest price at a 140-year-old hotel, diamond HHonors members get FREE access to the Continental breakfast in the Executive Lounge and the executive floors were remodeled last year.On the other hand: cleanliness has suffered and some very good staff have departed. Too bad.Oh, and the restaurants are not even to be considered; just go out any door and look around.And yet: location, price, location, price, location!


Room Tip: Highest floors are quietest, otherwise away from the El on Wabash is essential.

"I recently stayed here with my family, the first time I had stayed here since the mid 1980s. The Palmer House is a classic Chicago hotel with a stunning lobby and other public areas. We chose a plan with breakfast included which was a good deal, and we had a great stay. It is a short walk to most downtown Chicago attractions and a short cab ride to others. Our room wasn't yet ready when we wanted to check in so they gave us a $50 voucher which we later used for some room service. Our room had 2 bathrooms which are super tiny but nicely furnished, and was almost like a small suite. We loved the historic feel of the property, something you don't find in a modern sleek building. Also kudos to the bell staff who happily helped us with our 7 large suitcases and getting a taxi to the airport.


Room Tip: The 2 bed 2 bathroom rooms are a good value especially with 4 people in the room.

"As a Hilton Gold Member, perhaps my standards are not as high as some of the other reviewers of this hotel, but I love it! I've stayed at the Palmer House many times and have always had a very positive experience. There is no better location if you are visiting the Art Institute, Millennium Park, Shedd Aquarium, Grant Park, etc. We always stay at the Palmer House when visiting the Art Institute, which is what this trip was for. I booked a room with 2 bathrooms (a blessing when 2 women are traveling together). My stay already included breakfast, but when we checked in, I asked if we would be able to take advantage of the ""cocktail hour"" that is offered on the Executive floors. Without blinking an eye, our hostess Tatianna moved us from the 17th floor to the 22nd, with only a $5 increase per night. I seem to always get Tatianna when I check in and I can't say enough about how helpful, sweet and professional she is. I realize the Palmer House is old...it's a historic building for goodness sake! I still find it to be one of the most comfortable and homey of the Hilton hotels. If it's too expensive, look for the off season rates, they're very reasonable and you'll be able to treat yourself to a little bit of luxury.


Room Tip: Wifi is free if you are a Hilton member, not sure if there is a charge if you are not.

"As a hilton diamond member, I spend many nights at hilton properties all over the world each year and can easily say this is by far the worst hilton I have stayed at. While the building itself is nice, the rest does not meet the hilton standard: low ceiling and old room on the exec floor - suffocating!! Terrible breakfast buffet for $30 and parking for $60 a night!! Service is terrible, staff charged me the wifi by mistake, did not apologize and seem bothered to have to correct the bill. I would be ashamed of being the manager in charge Of this property, someone is not his/ her job. Avoid, trust me!"
"What a lovely lobby yet the experienced is spoiled in the lobby, restaurants and even the elevators by the most obnoxious techno-beat horrid musak. The corridors of the rooms are lined with photos of the wonderful stars from the 50's through the 80's who performed at the Palmer House. Nonetheless, their music is ignored in favor of thumping, overly loud and offensive music making use of the public spaces impossible. Do not plan to spend any time in the gorgeous lobby. Complaints were received with laughter."
"Stayed here for three nights and found it to be OK. I was in a standard room. + central location+ beautiful atrium downstairs + cleanDownsides for me where...- PAPER THIN WALLS - made worse by my neighbours screaming arguments- Small bed!! One thing I love about the US is the giant beds - no no, not here. Roughly the size of a uk double or smaller- huge - always a queue at reception. Always. Always. I felt like I was in a super market- internet did not work on two devices despite me paying the extra. Instead I had to pay twice then beg and barter for a refundI was not wild about the recently redone decor. It was a bit cheap / tacky. The bathroom was tired and clearly omitted from whatever refurb had taken place. Overall it was, as the title of my review, just OK."
"This is a great hotel. The staff was nice and the property is beautiful. The hotel lobby was a bit confusing, the check in desk is on the 2nd floor. The room was nice (Executive King Room) but there were a few small things that could have been fixed. (i.e. the calk around the bathtub was cracked and coming off and the wall plate on the water for the toilet was rusted)


Room Tip: Hotel is historic. We had an executive king bed room and it is the average size hotel room.

"I had a great stay at the Palmer House. I opted for the parking/hotel package which gave a discounted rate to use the parking garage. My room was upgraded to a double and the room was huge. It had two closets and enough walking space to so a Zumba class! Everything was great. Free wifi in the lobby, the octopus salad from the bar was amazing, and the hotel security was right on point! They came up to us at the bar to make sure our purses were not hanging off of our chairs. They instructed us to use the purse hooks under the bar. Two negatives: no refrigerator in the room and UPS charged me a handling fee to have a package shipped. Most hotels usually don't charge to have a package shipped to your room. I guess it's because UPS has a store location in the hotel. Great hotel and would stay again!"
"Stayed for one night over Christmas weekend, hotel was decked-out in holiday splendor and is one of my favorite classic hotels. This is a huge hotel & they pack them in with great rates over the holidays.The location & parking are great for downtown Chicago (ramp across the street is $40-$45 per day with in/out privileges).We were on the 19th floor & the crowds made the elevators serving the 18 floors + extremely busy (saw some 10 minute and longer waits). We took the less-busy 1-17 floor elevators and walked up 2 floors. Also took the stairs down-helps work off some of the holiday sweets....Tip #2 - no coffee in room (disappointing) and unlike other non ""in-room"" hotels, no free service in lobby for guests. Plus, the Starbucks on the ground floor typically had a 10-15 minute line. Answer: go to the Freshii's on the other side of the ground floor, no wait & a big (only one size) coffee was $2.20. Even gave an extra cup so could share with wife back in the room.Rooms were nice (we had a good-sized king) and staff was excellent. We had the bad misfortune of being next to a suite that became party-central for a group of friends at bar-time. The front desk sent security up & things calmed down (from shouting to loud talking) but still made for a lousy night's sleep. The front desk compensated us at check-out with a discount, but better plan would have had other members of this group in the adjoining room vs us.....not sure if check-in staff is schooled to think about this, but something to consider.Pool is small & OK for kids splashing, but that is about it. Nice health club, but did not get a chance to use."
"We had a wonderful two night post Christmas stay at the Palmer House. Can't say enough about the room, large with 2 baths, or any of the details of the stay. Every staff member was friendly and eager to help, from the check in to the concierge. Ate at the restaurant, and it was fabulous! Try the duck. We asked for a coffee maker and it was in the room in 5 minutes by a smiling staff member, and it was restocked the next day as well. The lobby bar was like having a drink in the Vatican, beautiful decorations for Christmas as well as the indescribable ceiling. All in all, can't wait to return, and many thanks to the staff who really are what made this a memorable holiday!


Room Tip: Our room was hip and historic, on the 17th floor. Large with 2 bathrooms.

"We stayed at the Palmer House for a brief weekend trip to Chicago. It was pleasant enough, but the lobby is so large it is a bit easy to lose track of kids and difficult to communicate with others in the party. Beautiful, but not very functional. Our room was nice and we enjoyed the staff, but the hotel was a bit unmanageable for our four-person party. It can be a little loud and drafty - to be expected for a historical hotel, but worth noting. We will probably choose something a bit smaller for our next visit."
"The Palmer House is an outstanding, landmark hotel, one that should be on anyone's list when visiting Chicago. The experience is fantastic right from the time one enters the premises--the staff, the architecture, the combination of a city feel with timeless elegance and exceptional service...all before one is overwhelmed by the beautiful lobby. And the service does not stop there....

"A complete rip off for the price. Paint was chipping off multiple walls and doors in the room. No bottom sheet was placed on the bed, the comforter was stained and even on the 8th floor I had a view of a brick wall. The bathroom was small and cramped and the tv channels came in fuzzy. What a total disappointment. You can clearly hear your neighbors and people in the hall. Wifi is an extra 10 dollars in the room. Caution: they charge extra for everything."
"Nice hotel, maybe a bit overwhelming if you are accustomed to staying at the places in the country. Very interesting main floor lobby with an awesome ceiling. After only one night, I don't know all it has to offer. My room seemed small and there was no coffee maker, but this is old school Chicago. It was comfortable and one or two people in the room would be fine if you are interested in being in this hotel/area."
"I love the hotel; I have for years. That said, the service has become too casual. At the moment, I'm sitting in my beautiful 1,000+ sq ft suite, but I can't get any service (besides the incredibly maid service...shout out to Natividad!).The personality and personel of the hotel is severly lacking. The support staff (front desk, door men, concierge) don't care about what you want or need as a guest. Once your 'in house', you're in.Too bad for them...I'm a huge Hilton guy, but I hold grudges in a way that could be considered liable. This place is no better than the Hampton; just a pretty facade. Goodbye and Goodluck!Christopher Walls

"My overall experience with this hotel has been excellent on several occasions. During my last visit, the check in for our group (20+ rooms) was as easy as it could have been. Many were able to get into their room before the check in time (and they were sold out the night prior). I didn't mind waiting in the gorgeous lobby just relaxing and people-watching. The room was nicely furnished and very comfortable. The concierge was AMAZING. I can't recall her name now, but she went well beyond polite. She was sincerely friendly, helpful, and made great suggestions for restaurants (and provided walking directions on a map). The sales staff (Michael W. and Velia T.) are incredible to work with. It was really great to be able to leave our luggage on the main floor while we waited for our room and when we checked out prior to boarding our bus for home. It's in a great location as well; easy to walk to many popular sites and an array of restaurants. Looking forward to another stay at this fabulous property!"
"I stayed at the Palmer house on a recent business trip. I had never stayed here before, but as I walked into the lobby, I was amazed. Absolutely beautiful lobby, with the classic arching ceilings. The hotel was also decked out with Christmas decorations, so it was even more spectacular to me.Check in was smooth and quick. However, as I got to my room, I was pretty disappointed. I knew the hotel was old, but was hoping the rooms were kept up to date. My room wasn't. It felt old...really old. Not the good old either. It had a light musty and, well, old smell. The room was very small and the bathroom tiny. I could barely take more than two steps inside the bathroom. I would say that I ""shifted"" more than stepped while in the bathroom."
"For an upscale hotel, we had two very unpleasant experiences in our room, which I believe is a housekeeping issue. 1) someone had previously used the shower curtain to wipe themselves; excrement was visible and smelly on the curtain; and 2) pleasure items were in a box sticking out from under the bed. #1 was discovered the morning after arriving as we got in late and let the front desk know. We were told we would be credited back that night's stay; and when the sex toys were found and I brought them to the front desk wrapped in a towel to present to the manager and we were told both nights would be free.... neither credit has been received to date.... Word to the wise, check your room immediately. This type of hotel should have impeccable cleanliness in their rooms... we're going to give them one more chance when we return for another Broadway show... hopefully they will have cleaned up their act by then."
"This was the most wonderful trip of my life...I live in Sarasota and have volunteered at Christmastime at Historic Spanish Point, formerly past of Bertha Potter Palmer's Florida estate here on the Suncoast, so my son thoughtfully reserved my stay at Palmer House for me. It was beyond a dream come true and I will return there whenever I return to visit Chicago. Thank you for making this such a memorable occasion! Well done!"
"Absolutely beautiful historical hotel - a rare find - and the hotel staff was extremely helpful and friendly. ""If only the walls could talk"" was my thought as I walked through these beautiful ballrooms and hallways admiring the fulfillment of Mr. Palmer's dream and the history that has taken place on this location since that time. Shopping and museums are easily reached from this hotel location and the staff is eager to assist you with any questions or issues you may have."
"This is a lovely hotel. The decor is very lavish, yet doesn't come across as pretentious. At checkin, I was asked if I wanted foam pillows. I said that I did and was told that they would be brought up immediately. They never did arrive. The wallpaper was peeling in the bathroom, which gave the room a cheaper feel. I would have had an excellent night's sleep, but my neighbors had others plans - instead of nicely closing doors in the wee hours of the night, they would just let them slam closed. They make products to stop this from happeneing...the Palmer would benefit greatly from investing in installing them."
"....Those walls are WAYYYYY thin. Next to us there were two couples who wanted to talk into the night. Fine--but it seemed that they were in the room with us. We finally got to sleep around one. The first time we called, Security came up but the second time they just offered to move us. I love the Palmer House and plan to stay there again, but be forewarned: You may get talkers next door, and your sleep will be compromised."
"We stayed here for our annual Farm Bureau the service was awesome from housekeeping to the cleanliness of the property. One man in particular was Antonio Legrier. He was sweeping area around doorway entrances he took such great detail in his work and was proud of the Palmer House. He took time to talk to a group of us asking why we were there, if we needed any directions, was there anything we needed. Thank you Antonio, you were a bright star on our trip. Palmer house, you have a true and valuable employee."
"My third stay at this iconic hotel in Chicago. I never get tired of this place. The Lobby Bar is a great place to relax after a long day. The bar staff is excellent and welcomed back the crew I was with. For an old hotel in the heart of Chicago it still holds it's glamour. If you are into shopping, there is no better place than State St and surrounding area, with 10 story Macy's. The Art Institute of Chicago is just a short walk away with the Bean near bye. Great location for your Chicago stay."
Every December for the last 6 years my wife and daughter have stayed at the Palmer House for their annual Chicago shopping trip. The staff is very professional and friendly. It is very important to me that wherever they say on this trip they are well cared for. The Palmer House staff (Olivia on their most recent trip) have always taken good care of my family. Dean Lane runs a great hotel. They have always been given a nice room but their most recent stay was one of the best. They were given a room with two beds and most importantly two bathrooms! This really reduced their prep time so they could spend more time shopping. :-) The stores the shop are all within walking distance of the hotel. They usually fly in to Midway and take the train to the hotel.We'll be booking next year's trip soon.
"While visiting Chicago over Thanksgiving, my boyfriend and I got engaged. He proposed to me in the Palmer hotel, which had the Christmas tree up and all the lights. It was wonderful. But two things happened which dampened our stay here - so that we won't stay here again. Seconds after we got engaged, we needed a picture taken. We were standing in the main lobby. Paul spied a waiter (it wasn't very busy) and asked him to take a photo. The waiter said ""maybe,"" then proceeded to walk away. Ok, we asked a customer sitting at the bar, who was happy to oblige. The waiter never came over. The timing wasn't perfect, but my boyfriend proposed while I was sick with a head cold. So we went up to the room, which was fine, and he ran out to get me tea and soup. When all the places (including Starbucks) closed and he could no longer get me tea, he requested from room service that they bring up a hot pot of water (or a glass!) while he forayed out to find a Walgreen's for cold medication. It's not that they brought the water late - IT'S THAT THEY NEVER BROUGHT THE WATER AT ALL. If you aren't going to provide a service, just say so! The cold was really bad - I was expecting relief and got NONE. Finally, although we requested a quiet room, they put us in a room where we could hear the El - all night long. Ugh. Don't get me wrong: I love the El. But not when I'm sick, and when we just got engaged. Not cool, Palmer House. I'm a long-time, repeat customer, but if you're looking to make folks who have loved you in the past keep coming back, don't treat them like this."
"While visiting WI, my girlfriend and I decided to take a trip to Chicago for the day and spend the night. Based on other reviews and the location, the Conrad Chicago was an easy choice. The self-parking was very simple and stepping into lobby for the first time was an experience all to itself; absolutely stunning and the fruit infused water was a nice start. Check-in was smooth and the room itself was awesome. When booking our reservation, we were asked for the nature of our travel, which was vacation and to celebrate an anniversary. We were welcomed to some chocolate covered strawberries, some refreshments, and a congratulatory card welcoming us to the hotel - now that is service! As others have mentioned, the bathroom was nothing short of incredible and we were more than okay with the view of the Magnificent Mile. The bed was awesome and we both slept in much later than we usually do. All in all, it was a great stay from start to finish and we were both very sad to be leaving the Conrad Chicago. Thank you again for a very memorable stay!"
"If you are planning a trip to Chicago, I would recommend this hotel. It's location is great - direct access to the Magnifcent Mile and walking distance to the lake. You actually never have to go outside if you don't want to - shopping and dining all available under one roof! The staff were subpurb and accomodations great! More importantly, the environment and location made me very comfortable, considering I was traveling by myself."
"We stayed at this hotel for four nights over New Years, last week. Hotel is in the perfect location for shopping and restaurants. We were upgraded to a suite upon check in. Staff was exceptionally friendly, and helpful with any questions. Rooms are updated and well decorated, as were the beds very comfortable. Lounge area has several tvs and a large sitting area. Would definitely recommend staying at this hotel."
"We got a terrific rate that was only $150 per night (through Hilton's site) which included valet parking. A total steal! The hotel location, amenities, and quality were top notch. The rooms could use an update but not bad enough for us not to stay again! The hotel is connected to the Nordstrom mall, close to restaurants, etc...we would definitely stay again!

"We absolutely loved the Conrad. Service is wonderful, the rooms are spacious, the bed is comfortable and you have a pillow menu. The bathroom is huge with a separate walk in shower and deep bathtub. We were on the 15th floor and had a great view of the city. It is one block from Michigan Avenue and connected to a mall. It is the perfect location and you couldn't stay somewhere nicer. Would definitely stay there again."
"From check-in the check-out, this hotel met or exceeded all expectations. We had a large room on the 16th floor that was very comfortable for our 4-night stay. The room was refreshed daily by the housekeeping staff. The room itself had a huge bathroom with sunken tub and separate shower stall. Bed was wonderfully comfortable. Staff was very accomodating with all requests and questions etc. We enjoy the fresh green apples and iced citrus water in the lobby each day. The hotel itself is well-located in downtown Chicago, close to subways, shopping, fantastic restaurants. Would stay here again!"
"Brilliant stay at this stunning hotel, perfectly located to all amneties. Rooms nice and comfy, bathroom was awesome. will definitely stay here again. Free wifi big plusOnly 1 issue I had was with the front staff upon checking, he was not very friendly nor did he explain to me the overall hotel services such as gym, and if i need a coffee maker in my room etc I had to call to request this. Other then that great stay."
"I stayed there for 6 nights for leisure. The location is excellent, near all the attractions and landmarks by walking distance, I like walking around in a cool weather. I checked in around 1:30pm but rooms not ready as most of the rooms are connecting? That's ok though as I went out for shopping. Great service from reception and restaurant, especially concierge team. All of them are so helpful and informative and made my stay comfortable!! Two things I would comment though, housekeeping service is a bit slow, I like to make up my room before noon time as I have jet lag, I normally stay in the room around 3 or 4pm and every time the room was not cleaned... The first day I informed reception at 9:30am then when I came back at 1pm the room is still not cleaned... The rest of the days I just gave up... I know it's running full house but I think guest's preference and request should not be ignored.Second thing is that the internet is HORRIBLE!! This is the worst connection I have ever encountered in Hilton and conrad group.. I'm a frequent traveller and internet is very important to me at some point. The first day I used the complimentary internet and it was super slow and disconnected all the time.Then I thought maybe if I pay $12.95 will be better and IT'S NOT! I don't mind paying for the charge but once the service is chargeable I expect the connection is smooth. I got disconnected ALL THE TIME when I was trying to order something online or sending out an email, it's unacceptable!! Other than these two things i have mentioned, everything else is fine. But I may try to stay somewhere else nearby next time."
"We planned a short trip up to Chicago and scored an awesome deal at this hotel (from the Conrad website even!). It's located right under/in the Shops at North Bridge, which is right on Michigan Avenue! So close to shopping, awesome restaurants and walkable to the river, Navy Pier and shopping all along the Magnificent Mile. Hotel staff are incredibly accommodating, which I hadn't necessarily expected since we were getting a steal on the room. Keurig coffee makers with Starbucks coffee, free bottled water, free wifi and access to plug iPod or iPad to the flat screen TV for streaming, etc. Only drawbacks - no pool and self-parking is $45/night (with in-out privileges though). Would try to stay here every time I come to Chicago!

"The Conrad Chicago, a Hilton family member, has proclaimed its location attached to the downtown Shops of North Bridge with Nordstrom's the anchor, for several years. Conrad Hotels are in second place to Waldorf Astoria in the Hilton hierarchy. Thus, one expects a modicum of luxury from such an esteemed standing. Unfortunately, while the Chicago Conrad is very nice and can often have good prices, time has taken its toll, and for a luxury accommodation, the Conrad lacks panache and style. The main entrance on Rush Street is unimposing with the main lobby on the fifth floor. You then must take a separate elevator to your room. This was often inconvenient because of crowding and slow elevators. The rooms, a nice size, are conservatively styled in what is now a rather plain decor; light wood, pale yellow walls, beige carpeting. The bathrooms are huge, with a lots of thick towels, strong hot water, large tub and separate toilet room. So why the mediocre review? Everything is dated, exuding a kind of morose aura, like a former starlet who has lost her looks and doesn't try anymore. The Conrad needs a good facelift, and soon. Chicago is ""hot"" right now, and new hotels are springing up everywhere. The competition is snapping at the Conrad's heels, and it needs to do something. The TV is old and lacks HD, something expected today. There's no coffee in the room, and while the coffee kiosk in the lobby is perfectly lovely run by a charming young woman, it is a pain to take the elevator down to get your caffeine in the morning. The River North location is perfect, except for the two elevator entrance and exit, and the staff very efficient. Yet, the hotel business is constantly evolving and the Conrad needs to find a ""fountain of youth.""

"There are many great hotels in Chicago, and this hotel should be on your list. The hotel itself is gorgeous, with a very nice bar and dining area in the lobby, and what looks like a terrace bar - which wasn't open because it's November in Chicago.The room is very nicely appointed and comfortable. All the things you'd expect in a Hilton with an extra touch to reflect the Conrad brand. Staff is very helpful.Location is great. You're steps away from the Miracle Mile and the Chicago River. If you're headed to Chicago, give the Conrad a look."

"I stayed here for 3 nights as I was working at an event in McCormick Place. The hotel is conveniently situated just off Michigan Avenue so it is a great location for shoppers. The bedroom was a good size with a large bathroom. The bed was very comfortable and I slept very well. The only disappointment was the dining and lounge areas, they seemed too basic for what is classed as a ""luxury establishment"" and had very limited choice on the menu. At breakfast time it got very busy so the staff found it difficult to cope with the demand. In the early evenings the bar area got very crowded, there was limited seating and again the staff found it difficult to meet the demand. However, on balance i would recommend this hotel but suggest you dine in one of the great restaurants nearby."
"The outstanding features of this hotel are probably its location, so proximal to Magnificent Mile, and also the size of the rooms. The front desk staff was very polite and helpful. The complimentary coffee in the lobby in the morning was hot, good, available... many teas, etc to choose from too. I liked the location of the bar. It was between the entry/lobby and the rooms. While this might sound odd, it lent to a very pleasant, casual experience. We did not dine in the hotel, as we had heard that this was supposed to be less than positive. There were numerous good eating spots within a stone's throw though. One cool spot to try, if it fits your desires, is Billy Goat's Cheese Burger, Cheese Burger, Cheese Burger (made famous by the old SNL skit). It is less than a minute from the hotel. We would stay again at the Conrad, no question.


Room Tip: twelfth floor was just fine, we were close to elevator (1229), and had no noise

"Conrad stands for luxury hilton, but there is no luxury in this hotel! The room is spacious, but it looks old, no design to it. The toilet got clogged once, and the water would not stop running, so if you woke up to use the bathroom, you'll have to get up again and switch the water off. A sock lost under the bed remained their until checkout. The room (828) was right by the elevator, and i could hear eny ladies heels any time of the day, because the elevator lobby had no carpet. 8 floor is conveniently accessed from the Rush street level. The front desk staff was polite and efficient. The blonde server at breakfast was very nice, all other were not efficient enough, and took 5$ off my bill, well, I'd better pay an extra ten for getting a loose tea, rather than a bag, and for receiving warm soy milk instead of cold, as requested. But can't but mention that the food wuality and taste are exceptional, the chefs are great! Upon arrival nobody has offered to take care of our bags. The hotel provides free water and wifi, which is nice. The gym is good, the a/c works fine. The lobby area is also fine. The Conrad Tokyo was wonderful, this one is not even slightly close. The trump chicago we stayed in previous time was outstanding!"
"Overall I would give this hotel an average rating. I didn't find anything spectacular to rave about from the time I registered to the time I left. The bed wasn't a good fit for me...too soft, but some of my colleagues said they slept great. The hotel drink prices are expensive. I had a 2 telephone charges for on my bill (as did some of my colleagues) for calls I did not make......in this day of cell phones, does one really need to use a hotel phone? Of course the front desk provided me with a corrected bill. If I were traveling for pleasure, I wouldn't go out of my way to stay at this hotel. It is convenient for shopping.

"Spent one night during the week. As gold member was given an upgraded room. The room was fine, bathroom had a large tub and a stand alone shower stall. They also had a small black towel for people to use when removing make-up. The first time we've seen that in a hotel. Public spaces were not impressive. The bar is on the main walkway between the front desk and elevators to the guest rooms so people with suitcases are passing through at all hours. Restaurant for breakfast had good service but poor food. Eggs were merely warm. Coffee was good and hot. Sausages were largely tasteless. The Rush Street entrance is below a walkway insuring darkness no matter the time of day. Not impressive. Then you must take an elevator to the 5th floor to register at the other lobby. Becomes annoying to have to take two elevators every timed you want to enter or leave the building. I guess it is a technique for keeping the homeless out of the hotel.Location is wonderful for shoppers and people in town for a good time. About a mile from most cultural venues.It is a good hotel but not a great hotel and does not stand out from other hotels in its class in the Hilton chains."
"We really didn't use all of the hotels amenities,but what we did experience was excellent. We were here for a medical meeting so received convention pricing. Our room did not have much of a view but we also had not requested one. The room was large with extremely comfortable king sized bed( lots of pillows),plenty of lighting, a desk,chair and ottoman, flat screen TV,safe, and a small refrigerator you can have stocked. The bathroom was very nice with a separate toilet room, soaking tub,separate shower and plenty of counter space for cosmetics. Beautifully clean. I will say I have never seen as narrow of a tub outside of Europe. High end bathroom toiletries and plenty of hot water with good water pressure. They also supplied robes and slippers. Just little touches that make you more comfortable. Turn down service must be requested. We did have the concierge make two dinner reservations for us,one at our request and one at her suggestion. Her suggestion was excellent and her manner was very friendly and helpful. The public spaces are modern and lovely. Coffee service is in the lobby every morning and pretty good too ! The location is great for shopping on Michigan Avenue. I would stay here again."
"Nice convenient location to shop and visit restaurants. A block from Michigan Avenue on Rush Street. Outdoor rooftop patio is a nice touch for drinks and dining. The hotel is connected directly to shopping including Nordstrom's. We opted for a two room suite which had all the necessities and then some. We had breakfast each morning in the restaurant where the service was quick and food good. The hotel bar had a nice assortment of upper shelf liquors, Hendricks Gin and Brugal Rum to name a few.Service staff is top notch.This is the second time we stayed at the Conrad and have been pleased both times.

"Had a very pleasant 6 day stay here recently. Located right in the heart of the city - close to where Michigan Avenue crosses the river, so literally an easy walk to anywhere downtown. Minutes to Michigan Avenue, an easy walk to Navy Pier, loads of restaurants shops and bars within crawling distance. Hotel itself was fine, clean with all the amenities you could want. I had a wheelchair accessible room so the room and bathroom was huge (not sure if all rooms are like this). Bathroom was nice, bed very comfortable, nice tv with 60 channels (must be America!). Friendly and helpful staff. The hotel overall is not quite as polished as Conrad hotels in other parts of the world (particularly Asia) but this is typical of these chain hotels when comparing the USA to restof the world. Still a very pleasant and trouble-free stay.I used the laundry service once and had no problems. The fitness centre is fine with properly working equipment (and open 24hrs). Complimentary wifi which worked well.My only complaints were that someone in a nearby room had a dog (ridiculous) that you could sometimes hear. Also the layout of the 5th floor is silly - the reception and bar area are on the 5th floor and face directly on to some of the guest rooms on the 5th floor, which means you get some noise in those rooms - avoid the rooms close to the elevators on the 5th floor.Overall a good stay, I will stay here again when I next visit Chicago."
"You know how it goes, you have a hundred windows open and then availability starts to disappear and you just book the next one. I knew the area I wanted to be in - walking distance to the miracle mile (this looks like it might be a block away, but actually it's on it) and close to everything else. We loved it! Nice sized rooms, comfy beds/sheets, nice bathroom with separate toilet, nice toiletries. Lovely lobby to chill out in, high end breakfast options, service was smooth and helpful everywhere. We got a really good rate that included breakfast, which was a nice surprise (all those windows, I didn't know what I was booking by the end!) I would definitely stay there again. We were a family, I would recommend it for older children, but not necessarily younger/tiny ones. Very good for business and I saw quite a few single business women, who felt comfortable staying there, as well as groups of business travelers and older families."
"So, a few things surprising about this hotel are both good and bad. I am writing this review from said hotel room where we are having a meeting for wealthy donors to the Red Cross. The good:*lighted make-up mirror*nice overall look to the room*great lobby*good amenities (bath products, Q-tips, toothbrush, mouthwash)*friendly staffThe bad:* furniture and desktop accessories showing tons of age in wear and tear*bathroom still has dirty floor showing shoe prints that don't match mine*no coffee maker in room (but some fellow mtg goers had it, most didn't)*room service pretty pricey ($30 for oatmeal and a cup of coffee this AM)*TV difficult to figure out how to operate; had to look at the in-room manual (what does that tell you?)*no newspaper despite being Hilton+ member*customizable mini-bar a bad idea as it will not drive revenue if you have to order a $125 bottle of vodka with 4 ""complimentary"" mixers. Just one mini-bottle would have sufficed and more likely to have been consumed* poor service in lobby bar as we had to go up to order after waiting 15 minutes*weird elevator system and conference rooms not well marked - took 10 extra minutes to find meeting room this morning

"You're going to have to decide this one on your own. Some good, some bad. I think it depends what type of room you get that would make this go up or down. Pros: I requested a Keurig coffee machine and a refrigerator to be in the room (free). They were there and in perfect order when I arrived. The hotel supplied free bottled water, which was wonderful. The sheets and towels were very clean and soft and sparkling white. The location is good. The room was very large. They put nice crystal in the bathroom - the tray for soap, etc. Very nice, looked first class. The water pressure in the shower was excellent. Breakfast was delicious and included in our package. Free coffee in the mornings was wonderful and much appreciated. Service was excellent all around. Free wi-fi in room was good. The cons: The hotel is configured in a rather confusing manner. I knew it would be odd from the previous Trip advisor reviews but it still was a little strange to me. Took a while to sort of figure out where I was going but it wasn't awful. The room was decorated in a god-awful brown and tan pattern. Maybe reminiscent of the 1970's, I'm not sure, but the feng shuai was awful and the colors and patterns depressing. The arm chair was threadbare, the ottoman worse. Nicked up and marked up from too many years of use. that was the point I thought that I didn't want to stay a whole week in a depressing room and was debating asking them to remove the chair. Or my other option was that I started dialing other local hotels to get prices. Decided to stick it out here in the end, but really that room was ugly as heck. I was sort of hoping for a relaxing soft beautiful room to sleep peacefully and relax in. Also double beds are way too small for two americans to sleep comfortably in. The bathroom stall with the toilet -when the light was right - was not clean You could see something splattered all over the wall. Since this was basically a closet with a toilet, I didn't really want to think about what it could be. The numbers were worn off the TV remote. The night stand had liquid splash stains on it too and I had to clean that up. Lot of dust. Shower head full of calcium deposits - really should have been cleaned. Lobby is also ugly, looked much better on -line. Too stark modern. Didn't give a warm welcoming feeling of comfort that I was looking for. Could have been a little more luxurious than it was. The safe in the room was not bolted to anything, which was kind of stupid. We were on the 7th floor and for many nights we heard non stop sirens and horns blowing from the street below. Apparently there is a hospital nearby and all ambulances seem to go by this hotel. I wouldn't have thought 7 floors up this was possible, but it was. I think a bell staff was blowing a whistle to hail cabs nearby because we heard shrill whistle noises constantly earlier in the day. The bar in the lobby was crowded but not really special. the drinks were incredibly overpriced and the bar snacks ridiculously stale and nasty. Couldn't justify the price of the drinks to get a second one or go another night. So I possibly would not stay here again unless I got a good deal but don't expect a whole lot of luxury. I think they have nicer rooms so maybe you could request that.


Room Tip: Don't pick the one I had on the 7th floor! Noisy

"I was at the Conrad for a meeting recently and spent three nights there. The hotel is a bit quirky in layout, given the way it's built into ia downtown location, but once you sort out the various elevator issues (which rooms are accessible from which elevator banks, etc...) that's no big deal. The location is fantastic for getting out and seeing some of the city, and hotel itself is modern, well-maintained, and very pleasant.It isn't without some quirks - when I was there they were having trouble w/ their internet/wifi access in the room but by the time I'd checked in they had figured out a work-around that was fine. In my guest room one of the phone lines didn't work and despite me asking daily to have someone look at it I don't think anyone ever tried to fix it. Or, if they tried they failed and never let me know they had been in the room.The hotel food is among the best I've ever had - really terrific food in room service, hotel outlets, and the food served to our large group. For anyone who does meeting planning type work I'd say that the staff is very gracious but not quite as top notch as the property would indicate. (Room turns when the turn-around was tight were BRUTAL, banquet staff was quite loud and disruptive in refreshing coffee/clearing buffets/etc... while meetings were happening, AV staff were a little slow to deal with feedback issues, etc...) So nothing terribly serious, but not quite the level of polish I would have expected.Overall though the Conrad is a great hotel, the rooms are spacious, well-appointed and in great condition. (Note - not all rooms have tubs/showers so if you have any wishes or needs for one or the other be sure to ask when you're checking in or making the reservation.) This was my second time at The Conrad and the quality has been consistent.

"Excellent hotel tucked away on N. Rush street in a great part of the city. The rooms are spacious, upscale and extremely clean. Bar and lobby are on the 5th floor, thus limiting the experience to those in the know. The Conrad is surrounded by fantastic dining options such as Eddie V's, Phil Stefani's and Joe's Seafood to name but a few. The Conrad is the starting point for my next stay in the Windy City."
"We stayed in Chicago for 3 days (2 nights) to celebrate my daughter's 16th birthday. I'm a Hilton Honors member and used 2 free-stay certificates for our two nights at the Conrad - so it was completely a reward stay - booked for a standard 2-double bed room.When we arrived, we were told that we had been upgraded for free to a Terrace Suite. We were hesitant at first because the two kids weren't thrilled when they heard ""pull-out"" and ""rollaway"" as the bed options after the single King bed i the suite. But, we went with it. What an awesome decision that turned out to be. The Terrace Suite (Room 1409) was Huge, and beautiful (and clean). The terrace had a wonderful view of the city, running all the way down to the lake, and was a nice place to sit and have a drink and listen to the city sounds.The amenities in the suite were top notch, from bedding to TV/music, to bath. And everywhere were windows with views of the city. Also, unlike most places we've stayed with a rollaway and a pullout - these were extremely nice and comfortable - not the thin flimsy types we've come to expect. The kids were quite happy with the bedding. In addition to the room, the staff delivered chocolates and a birthday cupcake to the room for my daughter, along with a personal note from the manager welcoming her. It was a nice touch and made her feel special.We also received vouchers for breakfast. I've heard many people complain about the HHonors breakfasts - the vouchers were all worth a free special breakfast or $19 towards another meal - which covered the American: Eggs, meat, potatoes, pastry/toast, coffee and juice. It was a lot of food, and was quite good. Not sure what those complaints were about - we were very pleased. Valet parking is expensive ($65/nt) but it is convenient. And the location of the hotel is great. We walked to the Pier, and to shopping and dining. Only needed a cab for a few excursions.All in all, the stay at the Conrad was perfect for us, and the staff was friendly. And we are extremely grateful to them for the wonderful upgrade and service they provided. It turned a good trip into a great trip."
"We spent five nights at the Conrad and were so pleased. Rooms are very clean and nicely finished. Beds are so comfortable as well. The whole property is beautifully finished and concierge is extremely helpful. Hallways are unnecessarily cold, however, and the restaurant is a poor choice for breakfast. Prices are so high ($52 for breakfast for two) and quantity is insufficient. A better idea is to go over to the restaurant at Nordstrom's but it does not open until the store opens at 10:00. Location is ideal.

"We were completely satisfied with our stay at the Conrad. It is close to all of downtown Chicago's main attractions either by walking or in a cab. This was part business & part pleasure and was great for both. The bar tender and wait staff were exceptional, offering many helpful suggestions and being entertaining at the same time. With so many great restaurants in this town we chose not to eat at the hotel (not even breakfast) so can not comment on the food or service there. I felt for the location and the facility it was an excellent value for the money. Would definitely go back."
"I had to attend a meeting and decided to take the family for a weekend get-a-way. We stayed at the Conrad and what a treat it was. Our King Suite on the 17th floor overlooking Michigan Ave. It was updated, clean and offered a great view. The kids never complained about sleeping on a pull-out sofa bed, so it must have been comfortable. The king mattress was superb as well.From reservations to checkout the staff was incredibly friendly and helpful. Add in the great location and this is a must stay hotel."
"Great hotel. From the moment we arrived, the staff was incredible; very friendly and courteous. My room was on the 12th floor and was very quite and warm. The gym area is pretty decent; couple of cardio machines and weight. It did not have a view though so it felt a little clustered. The restaurant and bar area feels very welcoming. Great service and bartenders. The food is really good as well but if you want other options you can go to the adjecent mall where you can find a food court.Will definitely go back!"
"The Conrad Chicago is a great location for easy access to shopping, attractions, museums, and public transportation. The service level was great from the front desk to housekeeping to the doormen. The rooms are nice with large updated bathrooms and comfortable furnishings. The restaurant however, was loud and ran fairly slow. For the price of the meal, you are better off checking out one of the many local restaurants."
"As others have shared, The Conrad has a great location in the middle of the Magnificent Mile. Service was very professional from the bellman through the front desk staff. I had a King executive room which was a corner room. It provided an excellent amount of space with one of the larger bathrooms that I have seen in my travels. This stay at The Conrad helped solidify it as my go to hotel when returning to Chicago."

"Spent a weekend here for work and a little fun. The Conrad was as good as last time- this is a real 4 star hotel: great, friendly staff with a sense of humor and will bend over backwards for you. Ate at the bar one night and bartender/wait staff were awesome and fun to chat with. Dinner food was good quality. Had breakfast one morning and it was good but not great: expensive and given that this is Illinois and not, say, New York City, breakfast seemed a little overpriced. The real draw at this place is the location and rooms. The Conrad is a block and a half from Michigan Avenue and lots of stuff going on there. The rooms are lovely, tasteful, and have extra touches such as way comfortable beds, huge bathrooms with soaker bath tubs, robes, slippers, and high end toiletries. Plus the staff gave me the room I requested. High floor with a city view was just right. I will keep coming back for these amenities."
"I received extremely great service from all the staff at the Conrad, the food for our conference was awesome and the amenities the hotel had were great, to include direct access to the mall. The bed was super comfy, the tv and surround was ultra neat and OMG the toiletries were awesome (i know weird thing to talk about but most hotel soap and shampoo sucks). The hotel is in a great location, I had such a great stay here and plan to go back."
"I love staying at the Conrad whenever I visit Chicago! The location is perfect, the staff is always wonderful, and the rooms are bright and comfortable.We were in town for a quick foodie weekend. The Conrad is an almost literal hop, skip and jump from The Purple Pig--perfect on a frigid Sunday afternoon. After learning our group of 6 would have an hour wait at the Pig, we went back to the hotel bar and had a super comfortable wait in the lounge and sipped on an adult beverage until our table was ready. Perfect!The Conrad app is a great tool! Whenever we left the room in the morning we requested housekeeping services. We did the same in the evening with the turndown services. Service was always very prompt--even if we ended up returning to our room earlier than expected. Our room was always spotless and waiting for our return. The housekeeping staff was wonderful!Check-in was smooth. And the free breakfast (as a Hilton rewards member) was a nice bonus! The Valet staff was always helpful and prompt in getting our car or in helping us stumble out of a cab after a 10 course tasting menu. The rooms are comfortable and bright. They are a nice size for a major downtown city! And the bathroom is HUGE!The Conrad will always be our favorite place to stay when visiting."
"This beautiful property never disappoints. From the moment one arrives at the front entry, the service is polished, personal, and professional. We requested an upgraded room as my husband is an Honors Diamond member. They gave us a lovely suite with a spacious bathroom. The view wasn't as nice as on other stays but that isn't what we came for! The bedding is wonderfully soft and luxurious, towels fluffy, absorbent, and large, and the other amenities in the room, sound system, coffee maker, lots of plugs, warm robes, etc. were great.We had only two complaints on this stay. One had to do with the restaurant during breakfast each morning. Service was slow but the food was delicious. The other complaint was that the property's bar is being renovated. As a result, the chemical smell from one of the adhesives or materials they were using permeated throughout the hallways in the hotel.We love the location of this hotel, particularly in the cold winter months."
"I booked the Executive Suite for my husband's birthday dinner. Upon reserving the room I explained that we would like a 10 person dinner table and place settings. The reason why I gave this hotel one star was because the hotel itself was very nice and they accomodated all my requests. We were very pleased with the room and setup. Our guests arrived at about 9pm. By 9:30 we had a hotel manager and another person at our door complaining that the noise level was too loud. Then by 10pm again they were at our door. Then by 11pm they were there again stating that all our guests needed to leave. Within the 1 1/2 we had about 3 phone calls. I even called to ask what needed to be done as we weren't being extremely loud or anything out of the ordinary. I have been to many hotels in the past. We were all adults and hosting a dinner party. This was not a teenagers house party by any means. 10 people having dinner does have some level of noise associated with it. We were enjoying dinner and each other's company. I had to rush my guests through dinner and cake. Then had to abrubtly call the night early due to this. I feel disappointed as I would have recommended this place. However I paid for a suite to host a dinner party just how the other guests paid for their rooms as well. I think it's a little inconsiderate that we were treated this way. We were just having a nice dinner and there is some noise associated with that. I think their expectations were unrealistic. Why have a room that holds that many people, prep for that many people, then act that way. We were not any louder than if you were at a restaurant having a nice dinner with 10 or so friends. I would not recommend this hotel to anyone younger than 65. It was very clear that the atmosphere and guests were of a much older crowd. I think it's inappropriate to expect that other guests sit and whisper to each other to keep the noise level down. Again I've hosted other dinners at many other Chicago hotels with no problems at all. I would recommend others use those hotels and not the Conrad. If you are looking for an uneventful and very very quiet evening the Conrad is for you.

"I stayed at the Conrad for a recent convention and had a good overall experience. The rooms are a decent size, clean, and comfortable. The bed and pillows were excellent. The bathroom was a good size and had a separate water closet. The lighting in front of the mirror was a little tricky to shave in, so I would imagine that some ladies would have similar complaints about doing make-up. The shower temperature was a little finicky, but not a big issue. The lobby renovations were just finishing the day of my departure and the new bar looks very nice. While I got a group rate deal for my conference, I have stayed at the Conrad before and found the room rates to be very competitive. For the location, it is usually hard to find a better deal. The property may not have a historic feel or be particularly charming, but for a long weekend in Chicago, the price and location are very good."

"When visiting Chicago the Fairmont is a great location Downtown which means you are well positioned to visit various attractions that include; The Bean, aquarium, Soldier Field, architecture boat tour (which was superb and I thought it was going to be dry) etc. We stayed 5 nights and paid the extra for the Gold Floor, well worth it. The team on the floor can't do enough to ensure your complete stay in Chicago is a success. Pay the extra and stay on the Gold Floor. Unfortunately from the wider hotel facilities we only used the gym, everything else was catered in the Gold Lounge so why try anything else when we already had great service there ? The floor team is lead well by their manager, Murtaza, a great guy and someone who helped us with all manner of requests and questions, even obtaining Fairmont tea! The floor lounge is a big busy at times with business people using this as a base but they quickly move on and when on holiday it's always good to get a bit of a long lie."
"I stayed for four nights at the Fairmont Millennium Park. I was there for a conference and the hotel is very well located to the other hotels and events that I needed to attend. The room and the view I had were beautiful and very well appointed. Loved looking out to Millennium Park and Lake Michigan. The other huge high spot in my stay was the Gold Level lounge. There was coffee, tea, water, juice, and soda all day and sweet snacks at 2pm and 7pm. At 5pm there were appetizers and two nights they were outstanding, and greatly offset my dinner. The best, however, was the breakfast, which is a full buffet meal with eggs, potatoes, bacon, pastries, oatmeal & cold cereal, yogurt parfaits, fresh fruit, and bagels with all the fixings. Loved the espresso machine. Loved the view and the place to meet up with colleagues. Ate twice at the hotel restaurant (Ario?) and it was just OK. Wifi free only for President's Club, but you can join while there.

"The Fairmont millennium park in Chicago is top of the line luxury. The rooms are modern and large. The views from he higher lever rooms have the most breathtaking views of the lake, which has a Caribbean like real color. The lobby of the hotel has a great wine bar which gets a good crowd in the evenings. The Fairmont staff is kind and eager to please, don't be afraid to ask for an upgraded room. If they have the availability they will certainly upgrade you."
"We were here for a two night stay attending a conference. Rooms are very nice with great bathrooms including tiled shower and separate bathtub. However, when we arrived, there was a long brown hair on top of the toilet seat lid and one in the sink. Not the kind of cleanliness you would expect from an upscale hotel. Additionally, the sliding pocket door for closing off the lavatory area did not work very well. If you get a room with two double beds, be assured those are DOUBLE beds and NOT QUEEN size beds. Comfortable, but smaller than expected. There is a also no real drawer space available in any of the furniture for storing clothing. There is a good size closet with a safe and there is another vanity area with a large mirror. Room service is very efficient, but also very expensive. Valet parking is $70 per night. Wifi is extra charge at like $19 day and there is nothing close to a complimentary breakfast. ALL of the staff were VERY friendly and efficient from the bellman to room service to the front desk. We found out too late that there are numerous food outlets in the lower level of the neighboring AON Building and that there is an underground walk way to many other locations. There's also a CVS Drugstore across the street from the hotel. If you bring a pet, there is a dog park across from the hotel, but you must navigate a substantive number of outdoor stairs to reach it.

"The American Education Research Association had it's annual conference in Chicago this past week and the Fairmount was one of the selections. The location was perfect for getting to the other conference hotels and the morning long walk that included city and lake views was very pleasant. I splurged and stayed on the Gold Floor with lounge and it was worth it. Great city views from the room and the breakfast etc in the lounge, including a very nice Italian wine, was great. Had a long window of time to work, which I did in the lounge rather than my room and it was very nice.

"I am a business traveller - 43 weeks last year. I stay in medium/medium high end hotels like Marriott/Hilton/Hyatt and iccassionally premium brands. However, I have never had the kind of incredible, personalized and professional service such as I experienced at Fairmont Chicago, especially with Fairmont Gold (Accountants and business owners take note: INCREDIBLE VALUE!)

"I had two gripes. The first was a dirty bed throw. They fixed that immediately and were apologetic. The second was that the rooms look a bit tired. This hotel just didn't live up to my experience staying at the Fairmonts on the west coast.The best part about any Fairmont is the people. They do hire some of the best you can find and so I don't blame them as much as I blame the actual property owners. The restaurant staff was especially good and the food was always terrific. I was there for a little over a week and I was pleased with the service.


Room Tip: I looked east and the view was terrible. Try and face the lake if you can.

"From the moment that we stepped out of our car and were met by the valet, I knew that this was going to be a great experience. The valet was pleasant and efficient. The check in process was welcoming and without problem. Our room on the 19th floor(1916) was spacious with two double beds. There were three windows and a great view of the street and buildings below. The beds were super comfy and the room was updated with modern decor. My favorite thing about the room, besides the view were the bathrobes provided with the linens in the bathroom. The conceirge was helpful and very patient with our questions. We were so close to the Museum of Art and shopping on the Miracle Mile. We enjoyed being welcomed back by the valets at the front door."
"We have stayed at this hotel the last three times visiting Chicago and yet have had a single complaint. My husband and I do not take exceptional customer service for granted anymore these days and the folks at this hotel deliver it (this is coming from someone who has worked in the restaurant service industry for 25 years). As a side note, the doormen are extremely friendly and helpful. Everything they suggested was a hit with us and certainly added to all the fun we had."
"Chicago has so many new luxury hotels, you would think it would be hard for the ""oldies"" to keep up. Having stayed recently at both the Fairmont Millennium Park and the Ritz Carlton, I honestly believe that what you may sacrifice in terms of modern amenities, you make up for in the overall quality of the experience. The Fairmont's concierge went out of her way to help us find a needle in a haystack, and came through with flying colors. Here, the staff really makes the difference. If there's something you want or need (even if it's just an extra ice bucket), you will get it. Quickly.If high ceilings and ultra-modern lobbies aren't crucial to you, the 5-star Chicago hotel experience is available at what some might consider ""bargain"" rates. Take it!"
"Loved the view of our second room and loved that we could walk to and from the train stations, navy pier, and millennium park. Everything is so close the problem was that our first room had blood smeared on the walls of the bathroom. Bad first impression at the least. Staff was happy to change our room but still felt dirty after seeing the bathroom of the first. Poor water pressure as well and towels feel like sandpaper."
"We spent four nights here in early December to experience Chicago at Christmas. This hotel was perfectly located for downtown Chicago, with everything within easy walking distance, such as Michigan Avenue aka The Magnificent Mile with it's designer shopping and plentiful restautants, Navy Pier and Millenium Park. The area around the hotel is built on three levels with the bulk of the city traffic travelling below and out of sight. It initially appears when you enter the hotel forecourt that you are at ground level until you realise that this part of the city is on stilts to facilliate the city traffic. It is designed very well ,thus this part of Columbus Drive is relatively traffic free, clean, safe and pleasant to walk on. There is also a Pharmacy and convienience store which opens late directly across the road which we found handy. The hotel is essentialy a tower block ( a tall one so it it can offer good views) with a lovely lobby area and central bar feature where you can sit and have coffee. It has a nice restaurant called Aria and a decent bar which offers good bar food such as Pizza, burgers etc and was large and lively enough to spend an evening. It had a decent selection of beers and whiskies and cocktails. There is a spa on the lower floors that appeared quite popular although we did not try it. The majority of custom and guests when we were there appeared to be business people and the hotel is certainly geared up for conventions, but this did not detract from the hotel having a comfortable holiday feel, it certainly accommodated families and indeed it made for some lively festive atmosphere in the evenings within the bar area. We were in a lovely suite on the 33rd floor with an excellent view of Lake Michigan, that also took in Navy Pier, the Chicago River and large parts of Millenium Park. This had excellent facillities such as Flatscreen TV, Coffee, Tea and walk in shower and bath. Importantly it had a very large and comfortable bed. There are plenty of great places to eat locally with a excellent Italian Restaurant called Fellini's directly across the road and a bar/ Restaurant around the corner on Wacker Drive called Houlihans that currently does an all you can eat Buffet Breakfast untill 11.30 for $9.99. Eat there and that will fill you up for the day's sightseeing. This place faces the Chicago river and directly across the bridge from it on Michigan Avenue is a bus stop/kiosk area where you can buy tickets for double decker and open top tour buses from which you can hop on and hop off as you explore Chicago. This is all approximately five minures walk from the hotel. All the Fairmont staff were extremly polite and professional and made us feel welcome although the place was very busy with business people so was not overly personal. This was not a problem however, this hotel is clean, modern, comfortable reasonably priced and in a safe location with very easy access by foot to what downtown Chicago has to offer. This is the perfect hotel for a city break in Chicago.


Room Tip: If holidaying ask for a room with a Lake view. It's impressive.

"We were attending a wedding in Chicago and this was the hotel suggested by the bride. Getting the wedding rate involved several calls which did not bode well, however we really liked the hotel once we were there. We could walk to lots of great shops and restaurants, and when it was raining they gave us umbrellas to use. There was a serious back up when we were waiting for taxis, but I guess that's not unusual."
"We stayed here for three nights through New Year's Eve. The hotel used to be pretty swanky and considered top notch. I think it's fallen. There's nothing elegant about it anymore. The spa was very nice, though.. The lobby bar - the Wine Bar - was open ONE time over the course of 3 nights. That was New Year's Eve - and only until 10PM. What? Why have a bar and not open it up? There's ONE restaurant - an Asian fusion place which was also always empty. I travel constantly - and very rarely do I have to pay a Wi-Fi fee anymore. Fairmont is hanging on to the past with this lack of amenity as well. I just think with all the hotel options in Chicago, the Fairmont needs to ramp it up."
"I spent a week working in Chicago in November and had the privilege of experiencing the delights of the Fairmont Hotel. Centrally located to where I was working it is also a short stroll to Michigan Avenue and Millenium Park with all they have to offer.The decor and service at the hotel is excellent and made me feel like a home away from home. I also utilised the club services where I was able to conduct some tough negotiations over a coffee in excellent surroundings. A fixture whenever I return to Chicago.

Green Features: I was certainly made aware of the practices and welcomed them."
I spent three weeks in this hotel when on a business trip in March 2013 (yes I'm writing this post pretty late after the fact) and I was blown away by the level of attention to detail. The staff remembered our names and small quirks about each of us within the first few days making it a truly personalised experience. There are delicious on site restaurants (some of the best sushi EVER!) and it is a very quick walk to the Golden Mile if you want to get in some shopping or head off to a nice restaurant.I signed up to the Fairmont member's club and hope to visit their hotels across the globe because this one was such a wonderful experience.
"We decided to take the kids along on a long weekend to Chicago to celebrate our anniversary. I'm a frequent guest at The Fairmont Olympic in Seatte (which is a beautiful property) so we chose The Fairmont Millennium as our home base for the trip. When we arrived we were offered the Gold Upgrade to one of their 37th floor suites (the top) and chose The Presidential Suite (We were told Presedent Obama has stayed there). I felt the cost of the upgrade was reasonable considering this was a very special occasion plus it included access to the 15th floor President's Club Gold lounge (serving snacks, horderves and delicious desserts). When we opened the door to the suite we were completely speechless! An absolutely elegant 1,800 square foot expanse with breathtaking views of Chicago and Lake Michigan! (And a baby-grand piano which my daughter used to entertain us with some of her favorite Christmas songs). It was magical! And the service and attention we received from The Fairmont professionals was impeccable! They turned our anniversary into a truly magical weekend with memories that will last a lifetime!


Room Tip: I highly recommend the Gold Upgrade to one of the 37th floor suites. You will not be disappointed.

"I couldn't be with my family in Chicago this year because...life happens. I stayed at the Fairmont Millennium Park and have no complaints. The exceptional staff has gone above and beyond to meet my needs and make us comfortable. Aside from 'Mama's house' this has been the best place to spend Christmas in Chicago. The atmosphere is friendly, yet professional. The property is beautiful and the views breathtaking. I even received a Christmas stocking personalized with my name! These people are truly amazing."
Chicago was the last leg of our long holiday so it was so relieving to stay at such a nice hotel especially since we booked it as a mystery deal on expedia.Hotel is stunning. We checked in and went up to our room to realise we were given 2 double beds instead of a queen or king so we went to the front desk and they were more than happy to help and upgraded us to a massive lake view room with a king bed!Good location. Super helpful staff. Great facilities (fitness centre was good!)Only negative was that weirdly enough they don't provide free in-room wifi and if you do choose to pay its pretty overpriced. However they do have free wifi in the lobby.Definitely would stay again but unfortunately wasn't impressed with Chicago as a city so don't see us coming back anytime soon
"This hotel is in a great location, great views, and a good hotel overall. Wewanted a great room for a holiday getaway with friends, and the Fairmont was the only one in the area that had a suite with adjoining bedroom, perfect to hang out in, but still plenty of privacy. Perfect location to do all the ""downtown things"" you want. A few small issues that kept it from being up to par with the excellence I would expect from a Fairmont, but nothing that made it terrible. We will definitely stay here again."
"From the moment I checked in and Morgan at the front desk greeted me with a smile and made sure I was happy and had everything I needed through the time I checked out of my exquisite room, everything at this hotel exceeded my expectations. I didn't book the Presidential Suite but Morgan made me feel like I was the most important guest in the hotel and that is a great feeling which can just get your stay off on the right foot. When the staff continues to exceed your expectations that has a way of keeping you happy the entire time. I have visited Chicago about a dozen times and this was my first time at the Fairmont. I can't wait to return."
"Our weekend in Chicago was enhanced with a stay at the Fairmont Millennium Park. The price was right for a wonderful room. The stay got off to an outstanding beginning as we were greeted by Morgan at check in. She was bright and energetic and her welcomed us back to the city and Fairmont as we have stayed at the hotel in the past but due to family situations hadn't been downtown for several years. Morgan gave my wife and I a feeling that this was going to be a special time. She reminded us of things that would be interesting to do and we had an excellent chat as she efficiently and quickly checked us in. In fact, we found all hotel personal to be exceedingly friendly and helpful. We were very pleased and will be making a return visit to the Fairmont soon.Mark M

"We stayed at the Fairmont over the weekend...our second stay at this hotel. We visit Chicago often and have used at least 15 different hotels over the years -- our decision is usually based on who has the best price for a four-star hotel and in this case the price was exceptional. (The hotel is also close to the Art Institute and our son's neighborhood.) No complaints about the front desk reception, the quality of the restaurant breakfast, or the free wi-fi for President's Club members.But as several other reviews have noted, this hotel is tired and lacking in the kind of detail that you expect from this brand. The $60 million renovation is visible in the lobby, but not in the rooms. More attention to detail would mean that the bedside lights would have been dusted, that there was more than one washcloth or bar of soap in the bathroom (which features separate shower and tub), that there were two robes for guests' use instead of just one, that there was a complimentary bottle of water (instead of a $10 bottle of Evian), and so forth. Stay at one of the many comparable options in Chicago and you'll see where the Fairmont is lacking. p.s. if President's Club members can request a pillow preference ahead of time (in our case, foam instead of down), would it kill the Fairmont Chicago to provide this option?

"This hotel is well appointed. The entrance hall is impressive with plenty of seating, and free WiFi in the lobby. I wish hotels would provide it without charge in. rooms, most do now but this does not. However, we were on the 10 floor, room 1016, beautiful spacious room. Two queen beds, a large settee, desk and chair TV etc. spacious bathroom. view not bad. BUT there was a bottle of water invitingly placed on a table with a note attached saying if we used this bottle a charge of 10 dollars would be added to the bill. I think this is totally out of order. It seems like They are trying to screw you for every penny. This hotel is not cheap and I do not like this practice. Location is near the park as the address confirms. The river walk is not far away and is very inviting in hot weather."
"I ended up having to stay at the Fairmont because I waited until the last second to book rooms for the One Direction concert that I was taking my daughters to Chicago for. It was much more expensive than I had hoped but after my stay I have been introduced into the world of luxury and I do not think I could stay in a regular old hotel ever again. We arrived much earlier than expected and they had no problem with setting us up with a room way before check in time. The room was beautiful and so updated and modern, with all the amenities you could need. The vanity area really impressed my girls, and the bathroom was so spacious and clean. I was so irritated that I would have to run and buy a phone charger, and then saw that there was a plethora of chargers to choose from right there in my room. Any request to the service desk was met with prompt, efficient and friendly service. Walking out the door to have the doorman blow a whistle for your cab to pull up and take you to your destination, wonderful. Some might be used to this, but I was not and I just loved it. The only thing that I would have appreciated was an additiion to the hotel handbook displaying the prices for items that are in the room. After hearing thousands of screaming girls for a long period of time, I could have downed every mini bottle in that fridge- if I had known what the damage would be on check out. Otherwise, fantastic."
"Multiple problems with lost reservations, poor check in , not the room I asked for, forced to move rooms into another room type not requested. Horrible attitude at front desk. The only saving grace is if you complain long enough you will run into a manger who will instantly take care of a problem that you have wasted 30 to 50 minutes on. My advice stay at the Palmer House or the Drake or any competenthotel. This is over priced and under performing."
"My husband and I traveled to Chicago for a conference. We were very pleased with the hotel Location was fantastic. ...a great way to tour the city was using the hop-on/ hop off bus. We did not eat breakfast at the hotel. We found a great little place down the street called Wildberrys and went there twice. The hotel is a great central location for walking around and exploring the beautiful city. Also, directly across the street is a drugstore and liquor store which was really handy. We would stay again."
"I stayed almost a week for a meeting at McCormick place (a big convention center to the south) and I must say that Fairmont is the downtown near almost all bus/train services. Room was great, very clean and tidy, restaurant is small one as it is well located you can try any other one near. Gym was small but Ok to quick runnings and unfortunately I wasn't able to use was the pool.

"we stayed at this hotel last weekend Sept 20. Location is great albeit a bit noisy from the adjacent fire station. Bell staff were great. The hotel felt like they were catering to business people and hence is probably not a first choice for families/couples on R&R. Rooms were spacious.The hotel was, in some parts, down on its heels. It was clear to me from their standoffish attitude, that the front desk weren't interested in travellers who are not paying ""full freight "" because they happened to book thru a travel agent. All in all acceptable but i must say they didnt dazzle us."
"My wife and I recently had the pleasure of visiting the great city of Chicago. The staff at the Fairmont was wonderful. Morgan helped beyond expections, making adjustments for the correct (better) room accommodations (Morgan, you really weren't ""mean"", I was joking!). In the Gold lounge, which I highly recommend as a place to start and end your day, Marlene is a star! She followed up on our accommodations to make sure we were happy and was a pleasure to see each day. The room was great, the restaurants were exceptional and our overall experience was 1st class+.Our stay at the Fairmont could not have been better! I highly recommend the Fairmont and make sure you are on the Gold lounge level. It's worth the little extra!! The Parents

"My wife and I stayed at the hotel on the 18th and it was a great hotel. The view from our room of Millennium Park and Columbus Avenue was outstanding we were on the 9th floor, the room was large and the bed and pillows outstanding. This was the first leg of our American adventure and we could not have chosen a better located hotel. It was our Anniversary and we were given a plate of fresh strawberries and raspberries, which unfortunately I could not eat but my wife enjoyed them.However, no free Wi fi and hotel food over priced. Obviously it aimed towards business trips. Perhaps a shoe horn, in each room and may be two cups for the coffee would have been handy."
"Just spent 4 nights here with my wife and received exceptional service in a high quality well managed hotelWe booked a Fairmont Gold room which included access to the 15th floor Gold Lounge.The service was amongst the best I have received anywhere.Nothing was too much trouble.The hosts made reservation bookings for us.Each day we enjoyed breakfast and refreshments with a great view of Chicago.On any trip to Chicago in the future, this is where we will stay.

"Was here for a professional meeting. The meeting space itself was way too cold but otherwise adequate. Catering was reasonable. I was disappointed by the overall hotel experience and attention to detail. I arrived late night and checkin was rapid and pleasant. But when I got to my room, my key did not work. I called from the elevator lobby to have security come up to let me in and bring a new key. I got more attitude than assistance from person they sent, sort of blaming me for not being able to get their key card to work, ....and no new key (so I had to go to the desk the next morning to get one). The next morning I discovered the coffee maker had no carafe and no basket for the coffee grounds, so brewing a cup in the room was impossible. I had joined the President's Club specifically to get free internet, which was very slow speed but adequate for basic emails. The room was actually nice with good workspace and a comfortable bed. A small group of us attempted to have lunch at the Aria restaurant in the lobby but, despite multiple empty tables, were re-directed to the bar (which we specifically had chosen not to go to since we were not in the mood for ""bar food"" or sushi). None of the very few tables were available so we had to sit at the bar, which made conversation difficult. Fortunately, the waiter did go get us a lunch menu from the main restaurant. So it you are looking for just a room to ay your head at night, this place is fine. But if you are looking for a luxurious or even high end hotel experience, might look elsewhere. I will not return."
"I must start this review by stating I am not sure how I got a gold room assigned.I booked on a 3rd party website and was not told it was going to include a free breakfast or any other perks so was quite pleased when I checked in to be informed of that.Was a last minute booking, as we missed a connection flight and were stuck in Chicago as a result.Had a very large room for a city hotel and even had a decent city view.The room was on the 14th floor but included was access to the 15th floor lounge for free breakfast and the other Gold perks.Bed was very comfyUsed the free wifi in our room which is one of the Gold perks.Another one was complementary rental of their BWM bicycles.When I woke up, I went up to the 15th floor lounge, the staff their was fantastic and I was able to reserve a bike for 2 hours.Set out around town and was able to easily cruise downtown, did have to walk the bike through the nearby parks: Millennium Park is steps away, Grant park not far and Navy Pier also close by.Was great to map out a walking itinerary for the day.The bike ride was great, after showering we went to the 15th floor Lounge for breakfast, what a spread! Comfy seats, all you could want to eat with top quality, fresh ingredients and items.Really nice espresso machine coffee maker, we even had a view of the Grant Park fountain from our table. Very quiet and peaceful as well.Definitely the best breakfast we had on this vacation and possibly the best breakfast we have had or at least in quite sometime. Checkout was nice and easy and staff was extremely friendly at all times."
"The staff at this hotel made me feel special as soon as I walked in the door. The room was spacious and clean. The bed was comfortable and the pillows were soft. The location here is pretty sweet, too. Restaurants and great shopping are all within walking distance. There's a CVS right across the street and a small grocery store right around the corner. The in room dining options include healthy choices. I don't have a single complaint about this hotel. I would definitely come back, and I would recommend it to others as well!"
"In the loop, about a mile south of the Magnificent Mile, across the street from Millennium Park, it's in a good location just a bit out of downtown. It's clean and in very good shape, with an exercise room - but no pool - and a spa. We were there for a wedding. The banquet room was impressive. There were over 400 for dinner, all of whom fit comfortably, with one of the largest dance floors I've seen. The banquet food was quite good - especially the hors d'oeuvrs. All of the staff were friendly, accommodating and efficient. Linens and towels were nice, but 4 star, not 5 star. Our rooms were large - especially the suite. The price was reasonable (we had a group rate.) Not sexy or exciting, but very nice.

"From the time we entered the spacious lobby until we left 6 days later, we enjoyed a wonderful hotel experience. Everything was done in a professional manner and every person we encountered was smiling and pleasant. Check in was a breeze. The room on the 29th floor was spacious, comfortable and well provisioned. As a member of their President's Club, free WiFi was a perk.The hotel's location was perfect for our needs and a 3 minute walk to our son's apartment around the corner. It's central location was convenient to everything we needed or needed to do. I would have no hesitation in recommending this fine hotel, and it is certainly on my list for a return visit."
"Location of hotel is great ( in walking distance to many attractions) and the $300 price we got through booking.com seemed fair for the quality of the room and location. And being in dowtown Chicago, I was not overly surprised by the seemingly steep price to overnight valet park your car - $64 per night. However, our initial very positive experience to the hotel was tainted by the very negative experience we had with the valet parking at time of our departion. It took them 1 hour to get our car out of valet parking from the time we requested it to the time we actually got our car. A series of unfortuante events including the original request never being entered, to them bringing the car to the wrong area showed poor management and possibly understaffing. Another woman waiting with us had been waiting 90 minutes before they found her vehicle."
"I had an opportunity to stay at this hotel last month for business. I enjoyed my stay. The check in was fast, the rooms very nice and spacious and my room had a wonderful view. More importantly, for folks from out of town (me), getting out of the hotel in a rental car was easy and put you on a street that was not very congested. This allowed your GPS to capture a satellite and get you to your destination. Valet parking (only parking available) was a steep $60 daily. Ouch.The facilities were nice and easy to get around. I did order room service and the food was absolutely outstanding and priced about right for this type of hotel.I flew into O'Hare airport and then took a rental to the hotel. I had my Garmin GPS unit directing me and it soon got me going in circles in downtown. Perhaps the tall buildings were messing with the satellite connection. But, I got my phone out, used Google maps and it took me straight to the hotel - 1.5mile away in a different location entirely !!

"You're paying for top four star hotel but you're getting an average three star hotel.We stayed in this hotel for five days and everyday you get more disappointed by hotels staff.We pay for 2 Gold Rooms and none of the services they've described is available or partially available. For example they offer you a BMW bikes but when you want to use them they're not available and a very rude hotel staff tells you the entire hotel has only three bikes!!!!!??? Breakfast is a Motel style buffet. They shouldn't offer them at all to save the Fairmont's Name as a Luxury hotel. In our past stays at Fairmont, we've always had traditional services and great accommodations. We've been to at least four Fairmont Hotels, and this by far is the worst one ever.To top it all off, we checked it in late at night(12:30 AM) and the front desk lady was very rude, clearly didn't want to be there, and made us very uncomfortable, especially since we had a long flight from NYC. So the Check-in was not a welcoming experience at all. I definitely will not be back at that location, and would warn others from choosing this hotel."
"The rooms are pretty dated - there was a dock which only fits IPODs and not iPhones. There was no hot water kettle too as hot water was dispensed from the nespresso machine instead. The capsules for the nespresso machine was not replenished daily. Room service was not fantastic, there are better food places around the hotel. Service at the front desk was good though, that was the best part of my stay."

"I was expect a better service from the fairmont hotel, but this one just delivered average service. The wait time to check in is a bit long due to the people checked in prior to us was complain about they didn't get the room they asked for. When we are checking in, there is no apology about the wait time. I understand is not their fool, but at least try to be polite about it. The room was great, great size, nice and clean. Bed is a bit too soft, but still really comfortable. Second day when we check out, it took no time to check out. They didn't even ask how was my stay, just check me out. Which is another minus. And the bell desk person is a bit impolite when we want to store our luggages, it's not the word he said just the attitude when he is doing his job.Overall, the stay is ok, the hotel deliver what it should deliver. And nothing special about it. Great location with great price. But just ok service.

I was in Chicago on business for 3 days. The last time I was at this hotel I was very disappointed. I switched rooms twice because of dingy-ripped carpet and dirty bathrooms. I was pleasantly surprised this visit. The first room I received was very clean. The bed was very comfortable as well as the pillows. The bathroom was impeccable. No mold. This is very important to me. The water pressure was good. The AC works very well. They also have air purifiers in each room. The location is excellent. Short walk to Madison Avenue. The food was very good I ordered both breakfast and dinner from room service. I would definitely recommend this hotel.
"This hotel is well well run, polite helpful staff. The rooms are clean and maintained. The beds are excellent. The hotel is in the centre of town and you can walk to all attractions and shopping. I would stay here again , it is not over the top luxury but very easy to live in .

"We checked into the Fairmont Chicago on July 6 and checked out July 8. The July 4 weekend crowds were gone, the weather was great, and Chicago was at its stunning best. Our entire experience at the Fairmont was superb. Our lovely room had a great view looking towards the lake. We were lucky to have access to the Gold Lounge and it is impossible to say too much about it. Quiet, classy, with exceptional service. Jackie and Spencer were unfailingly helpful, especially because we arrived in Chicago with no tourist agenda and didn't know where to go or what to do. The staff provided us with great suggestions and helped us find our way to The Art Institute, the Field Museum (within walking distance), as well as how to negotiate the train to visit family. I hope we are fortunate enough to stay at the Fairmont again. I will certainly make th e effort to do so."

Lovely seating area with desk and a table and chair overlooking the lake.Beds were so nice and bathroom is a palace. Room service flawless and prompt. Housekeepers attentive.Nice workout room. Dinner in restaurant was great.And it was Valentine's Day. Oh yes we had fun also.


Room Tip: Ask for the upgrade. I think it was like $59

"My wife and I came to Chicago to celebrate my wife's birthday which happens to be on the 4th of July!I booked the hotel with the gold services because of it's name and location. The service exceeded our expectations.While we were on the highway travelling we received an e-mail from Marlene Tapia; the Fairmont Gold Supervisor asking if there was anything she could prepare for us for our arrival and if we had any questions.We requested a room facing the fireworks and suggestions of restaurants and other recommended sites to visit. Within a short time we received. Response that our room was reserved and a list of attractions to see.When we arrived at the hotel to check in Marlene was pleasant and extremely welcoming. With her high energy she booked a boat cruise for the fireworks and gave us an overview of the hotel services.On top of taking care of all above, while we were in the gold room enjoying some snacks on her suggestion a personalized birthday cake was sent to our room for my wife on her birthday.This is just part of the courtesy Marlene showed us and we will return to the Fairmont and Chicago.Needless to say this added to the great experience at the Fairmont Hotel.Thanks for making our trip in Chicago great!Craig and Lillian Cooper"
"We really enjoyed our stay. We had a suite and it was a great size particularly with a toddler. Friend of ours had a standard room that would definitely not of worked with a child! The hotel were very accommodating and even arranged a highchair for our room. It was clean and the bed was very comfortable. The location was fantastic. I could pretty much walk everywhere with my pram and it was easy for my husband to get to the McCormick centre which is where his conference was. Room service was good. The concierge was very helpful and never put us wrong in eating out recommendations or activities.A great trip. - thank you!


Room Tip: If you have young children you will definitely need a suite for the space

"Excellent staff! Professional, courteous & caring from the front desk, to the bell man, to the cleaning staff really the whole staff was just fantastic! Good location, close to Magnificent Mile, Millenium Park, the waterfront and some other restaurants. It's also helpful that it's close to a CVS. Not thrilled about internet charges or fee for fitness center--hate being nickled and dimed when I'm at a hotel. Eno Wine Bar was nice--needs more by-the-glass offerings. Decor or lobby and room were really elegant and unique. Breathtaking views of the city skyline--I really enjoyed the view!Bottom line: An elegant escape in the city that's close to perfect."
"I stay here often when on business in Chicago. I like that the hotel is quiet at night and the lobby is very nice. Bathrooms are good size too. I usually don't have issues when I am there but this time housekeeping did not leave washcloths in my room twice and they took my extra pillows when they cleaned. Also, a bulb was out in the bath. All was fixed but annoying to have to call to get it done. Love that they have work out clothes for me to use!"
"I booked a suite for the weekend to celebrate a night out on the town with a friend of mine who is getting married. Made the reservation a month ahead of time, got to the hotel at check in time and was told my suite had been cancelled. Instead, I was given two rooms. This did not work for the group of girls I had coming in. Aside from this, there were no rooms ready when I got there. I had to wait an hour for two rooms to become available. Everyone else in line who had suites were told the same thing. Some people were even asked to pay extra! Typically when a hotel makes such a high mistake, they provide the customer with something free, a breakfast, drink at the bar ect. Not here! All I got was an attitude from the front desk person. For a luxury hotel, they sure have problems keeping their reservations straight! How can anyone book with confidence knowing their reservation can just be cancelled on a whim."
"We expected a business hotel in a great location but what we got was soooo much more! The front desk did their best to find an appropriate room for our early check-in and the upgrade cost for the Gold Level paid for itself immediately. The Gold lounge saved the day as my husband and I were able to enjoy early coffee and breakfast while our teenagers slept in. The concierge in the Gold Lounge - Spencer - was an amazing fountain of helpful knowledge. I had booked our family's Chicago get-away on the fly and was really unprepared. Spencer to the rescue! With maps, suggestions, discounted tickets, reservations, you name it, he was ready and able to help maximize our visit....and his advice was always spot-on. Concierge service does not get better. Take full advantage and enjoy your trip like we did."
"Stayed one night with our two children. The location was great, an easy walk to the Chicago Loop, a little too far to walk with a toddler and a baby to the Navy Pier. The room was beautiful, the carpet a little shabby, but the rest of the furniture was clean and the beds were super comfortable. Professional check in and beautiful lobby, quiet sleep. No breakfast is served here, but the staff were friendly to us and gave us good tips and ideas of what to see in the city. Pleased overall!"

First off when I arrived thwre is no free parking 25 a day at the hotel. Then since this was a business trip my office booked the trip with the company credit card. For some reason the hotel didnt have it on file and didnt tell me uat check in they asked for a card for incidentals ok fine then when I checked my balance they charged my card 1600 dollars went to the front found the error changed the card well then they said that money wouldn't be ut back for another 5-7 days what a freaking scam. I definitely will never stay here again and will make sure all the 1000 employees in my company know about this crap. There are many great hotels in chicago for half the amount 5 star hotel what a joke. They also dont tell you there is a fire station next door that blares their sirens about every hour all night long not very fun at all.
This is my first time staying at the Fairmont Chicago and I am not disappointed. I informed the hotel that I would arrive early and the staff was able to put me in a room when I arrive shortly before 10am. I was very impressed. The room was spacious and the bed was comfortable. It has a nice view of the lake and the park. The internet is complimentary since I am a member of the Fairmont President Club. The hotel is located within walking distance (10-15 minutes) to the loop and magnificent milesThe only complaint is that some of the exercise equipment in the fitness center were broken.
"We got a good deal for 2 nights at the Fairmont. You can tell they put a lot of money into the front entrance as well as the hotel lobby, very modern, very appealing. Right out of the gate, when we made our reservations, we asked for a King bed, we were told, ""No problem, we have plenty of King rooms during your visit!"". So when we checked in, we asked fro a King Room, they we were told it would be an extra $100/night for a King Bed! Unbelieveable! So we were given a room with two double beds! Not queen, but double beds! Not a good way to start the weekend!The rooms were far less appealing than the rest of the hotel. The beds were comfortable, the service was horrible! We returned from a day on the town, roughly 3pm, the room had not been serviced. We checked the door to see if we accidentally left the ""Private"" sign on the knob, nothing there. We called the front desk and asked to have the room cleaned after 6pm, I even tracked down one of the cleaning ladies and told her the same thing...came back to the hotel later that evening...still not cleaned! Follow up on a simple request, please clean the rooms!Should have never left our other hotel! Unfortunately, I would think twice about staying at any Fairmont Hotels again."
"The hotel needs to make sure the AC works properly in rooms before checking a guest in. If a guest calls about AC issues its ok to send the maintenance worker, but the front desk needs to make sure the guest is satisfied or willing to change rooms. The guest should not have to get cool air the whole weekend from a baby fan. The hotel staff should not automatically assume people are okay using feather pillows, some ppl are allergic and cannot use them! The view was wonderful. The valet charge was ridiculous. I believe its not worth it, I could have had a better stay at a Quality Inn"
"My wife and I, living in the Chicago suburbs for the past 30 years, had the change to spend two weekend nights at the Fairmont Chicago in April. We were very pleasantly surprised at how good a time we had. The location of the hotel provided a convenient central base to explore not only the nearby sites such as Millennium Park, but the new next door area named Lakeshore East, and since we had a car, made it easy to visit the Museum Campus and even down to Hyde Park and the University of Chicago area. We also tried out the new DIVVY rental bikes which have a spot very close to the hotel. The Aria restaurant had a variety of breakfast menu items that ranged from the traditional Eggs Benedict to an innovative and delicious Country Benedict with a poached egg on a biscuit covered with a pork and gravy sauce. There were ample refills on orange juice and the tea came in a pot so you could have several cups. The valet parking was very convenient on the lower level, although one can do from the main entrance as well."
"It was our first time in Chicago and we have no regrets. The hotel is very well located, with big rooms, and a good service. It's a big hotel, so you don't have a lot of individual attentions. For example, they didn't tell us about the stores that we could go through the lower level of the hotel, we discovered unconsciously, and it's a very important information because of the cold weather. Other thing to point out is something not essential but I think they can improve: the shower is a little bit weak (I don't know if it's the perfect word to describe).


Room Tip: The view of the millennium park is great.

"We stayed here over Easter weekend and had a mostly enjoyable experience. The rate was a little higher than some neighboring and similar hotels. The hotel was quite dead the entire weekend. We only saw a handful of people all weekend and never heard them on our floor. The restaurants are similarly dead. Not a great place to catch a nightcap. The hotel is conveniently located in Millennium Park. The staff are very friendly and accommodating. Some of the best service I've ever received. The rooms were quite clean and modern. Two minor complaints: the staff never replaced our toilet paper all weekend and we ran out (had to call) and the shower didn't drain correctly and the water pressure was weak. Other than that, it was an enjoyable stay. I'm not sure I'd stay here again with all of the other attractive and cheaper hotel options in the area, but an enjoyable experience overall.

"We went here for my wife's birthday. We originally booked a Gold room, but at the last minute decided to go with a Gold suite. I think a gold room would have been plenty large enough. A Gold room provides you access to the Gold lounge which provides a continental breakfast which is more like a light buffet and Hors d'oeuvre in the evening which were quite substantial. Also, don't miss the deserts later in the evening. You do have to pay for alcoholic beverages in the lounge and be prepared to pay hotel prices. The staff at the hotel was excellent. From the time the bellman took our luggage at arrival until a bellman hailed us a cab at departure, all staff were friendly and helpful. Jackie and Marlene were particularly helpful in answering questions before our arrival. The location is outstanding. The views can be fabulous. I would ask for a South or East view. As an added plus, there is a deli and grocery store right around the corner if there is something you want or need. We are already making plans for our next trip to the Fairmont.


Room Tip: Rooms on the South or East side.
